    <p><strong>Now let us define the word asshole</strong></p>
    <p>According to urban dictionary an asshole is <strong>"A person who is intentionally cruel, obnoxious and heartless."</strong> </p>
    <br/>Though the appearance of assholes does not follow a stereotype, behavior does. Assholes tend to:
<br/>-ENJOY NOTHING MORE THAN BEING AN ASSHOLE.
<br/>-Smirk. A lot.
<br/>-Argue for the sake of arguing.
<br/>-Laugh when they win an argument.
<br/>-Never let you hear the end of the argument they won.
<br/>-Participate in arguments they know they are not going to win.
<br/>-Not stop arguing until you give up because there's no point in arguing anymore even though you know you won.
<br/>-Associate your giving up with their victory.
<br/>-Point out every flaw your argument has, regardless of the subject. All the asshole cares about is making people look stupid.
<br/>-Ambiguously answer your questions.
<br/>-Deny that they are assholes out loud.
