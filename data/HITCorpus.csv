421,YTA,AITA for telling a fellow student its sad that they dont have any practical life skills?,"This all took place before schools shut down but recently the other student in question keeps sending me pictures of things like their cooking or cleaning so its been on my mind.Basically, one day at lunch a friend of mine (Well call him James) brought a really elaborately cooked meal. I cant remember exactly what but it was around the level of sushi or something that you could feasibly make at home but is generally considered difficult. My other friend (Well call him Jeremy) and I complimented James on making this hard meal himself and he said that he was glad he had been learning to cook for so long since itll be a handy skill when he leaves home for college soon. I have been cooking for my family since I was about 12 since both my parents worked full time and I wanted to help them out. Along with cooking, I also do most if not all of the cleaning just to take pressure off my parents. So to me, what James said was very understandable as the skills I have learned from cooking and taking care of a house are going to be really helpful when I move out. Jeremy said he was worried about leaving home because he doesnt have much experience with cooking or cleaning because his Dad is a stay at home parent who does most of that, but said that he was trying to at least get the basics. The real problem was our other friend who Ill call Amy. As soon as we started talking about cooking, Amy seemed to almost brag about how she had no practical life skills. She kept going on about she can never cook pasta or rice because she always forgets to add water and other similar cooking mishaps. She seemed to be expecting us to laugh but really it just seemed sad to me. Shes leaving home in a month or so (pending Covid) and I basically asked her what she was going to do when she left if she had no survival skills. I also said she shouldnt brag about never helping out around the house because that wasnt a cool thing, it just showed that she was a little spoiled. She got really upset so I apologized and Jeremy said that I went too far, but James agreed with me that not being able to cook or clean isnt an accomplishment. I feel really awful because I didnt mean to call her lazy or hurt her feelings, but AITA?",184,55,2020-07-15 15:38:06
901,NTA,AITA for asking my co-worker to stop ellipsing me?,"Ive been at my job for 3 years now and have a co-worker who has a reputation for being extremely difficult to work with at times. This is well known by everyone at the office (to the point where management has openly joked about it to the rest of the team) and his moods are tolerated because hes a quick producer.He drives me completely insane sometimes, but were close in age and have a lot of similar tastes in pop culture, music, etc., so were de facto work friends.This co-worker has a habit of answering work instant messages with an ellipsis. Not to signify an omission or the passage of time: just an ellipsis. If a reply comes after it, theres generally a considerable pause.*A few sample interactions from real life work IMs*Me: Hey, I cant get this code to run on dev.Co-worker: ...Co-worker: Which VPN are you on?-Me: I dont know if this package will be easy enough for the whole team to use.Co-worker: ...Co-worker: Its just a tool- Second co-worker: Can we add a secondary ID to each element for tracking purposes?Co-worker: ...Co-worker: Sure-Third co-worker: I can use some help testing when you have a minute.Co-worker: ...To me, this is the textual equivalent of a dramatic sigh or an eye roll. Like your question or statement is so annoying or rudimentary that it bears noting before you get an actual answer. This happens generally several times per week, and after 3 years, it feels a bit exasperating.He did it to me today, and something in my brain just snapped, I was not in the mood. So I said to him, Can you cool it with the ...? Its super aggro and tbh makes me not want to talk to you sometimes.He got really defensive and said that hes been doing it since he was on AIM as a kid. My initial thought was that it was obnoxious then, too, but I didnt say that. Dont know if this is relevant, but hes 33 and English is his first language.Am I the asshole?[Edited for formatting]",19,33,2020-07-13 21:43:40
129,NAH,"AITA for hating being a parent, refusing to have another child my partner desperately wants?","I've been with Jim for 9 years. Married 5.Jim always wanted kids. At least 2.I always imagined myself being a mother, too, eventually. When I met Jim, I didn't really have a maternal instinct, but I assumed this would come.As I approached 30, Jim brought up the subject of kids more, as he said if we wanted several, we shouldn't wait too long. I still wasn't feeling very motherly. But everyone told me it would come. I loved Jim & our life together. So we married when I was 29.  I gave birth to our son Evan at 31.Pregnancy was difficult, and I was feeling sick all the time, but I thought there would be a reward at then end.There is no way to sugarcoat it: I love my son, but I hate being a parent.I feel like I have no life at all. I can't do anything I enjoy. I don't recharge from anything. It feels like there's only work and being a mother.I used to be an artist, abut my wage could not support a baby, and we also bought a house, so I was forced to take a higher-paying office job, which I hate.Jim knew I was having an awful time. To his credit he did a LOT around the house and he's a great father. But even with his help it seems like a never-ending pit.I've been to a therapist, but I don't think this is post partum depression. Not anymore. I think i just genuinely do not like being a parent, and I feel like I can't tell anyone.Evan is now 3 and started kindergarten this September. It felt like such a relief. It doesn't really change much about my free hours, but it felt like such a milestone. A relief. I also love that I can now already have conversations with my son, albeit simple ones.Corona was  awful for me. I did home office and Evan was home from kindergarten. I couldn't deal with having to focus on work & also having a 3-year old at home.I feel like this was just the final blow for me.I decided I never want another child again.Jim had already mentioned a few times that he would like to have our second soon, as I'm 34 by now, and as he doesn't want the age difference between our two to be too large.First I cited the virus as being a bad time, but in my heart I knew there would never be a good time.He mentioned it again the other week. I was just so tired an fed up, that I broke down and said I hated having to take care of a baby and I never want to do it again.He got very upset. He brought up that he was always trying to be supportive (which he was) and that he had always told me he wanted kids, at least two, if not more (also true).We argued a bit, going back and forth.He then asked me ""Are you sure, or just upset now?""I said: ""I'm upset but also sure"".He said then then he'd really need to think about what he wants to do.We haven't really talked much since. We've been polite to each other, but mostly just functional conversation.Tell me Reddit, AITA for refusing to have a second child, even though my husband wants one, and we agreed prior to marriage?",2334,549,2020-07-11 19:22:16
850,NAH,AITA for hiring my friend's former father-in-law to do a job for me?,"I have a friend, Sara, who went through a very ugly divorce from her ex-husband, Mark, 4 years ago. She was the one who asked for it and Mark and his parents, Sara's former in-laws, treated her very badly after that, for quite some time. Last week, someone tried to break into my husband's office. They failed (the police said it was an amateur job), but they damaged his door lock a lot, so we had to change it. And since we'll be going through the trouble of installing a new lock, we decided to also install a new, safer door and an alarm system, which brought the cost way up.My husband and I called a few locksmiths to ask for prices and one of them was Mark's father (he's a locksmith). After my husband told him he knew Mark, the father offered us a discount, which meant that his price was by far the best one we received. We ended up choosing him.I didn't want to lie to Sara or hide things from her, so I told her. I just wanted her to be aware of what happened in the event that Mark or his father ever said anything to her about it.She didn't take it well and said that I never should have done this because I knew how badly they treated her during and after the divorce. I told her I'm sorry he felt that way, but that it was unfair of her to hold this against me, because it was just a business transaction. It's not like I socialized with her ex FIL.She said it was totally fair because she'd never do anything like this to me and that she would never risk our friendship to save 250.I told her that if she felt that this was risking our friendship, then maybe it wasn't that strong to begin with, and she ended up calling my husband and me assholes. Were we?",22,13,2020-07-11 13:53:00
383,NTA,AITA for having micro food aggressions?,"I know the title sounds bad but hear me out. I'm 25f and I moved out of the parental household about 5 years ago. I lived with mother, father and two brothers Brandon (21) and Kylen(20). Brandon has a HUGE appetite and can never seem to get full. He also has the same food tastes as me. When I lived at home and I started working at 16 I started using my money from work to buy some of the things I wanted from the store like snack cakes, candy, breakfast sandwiches for school etc. My brother's always ate EVERYTHING. Out if a pack of 20 ANYTHING I would get maybe 1 or 2. It always infuriated me and my parents would condone this saying that if it's in the common area it's free game, but I also wasn't allowed to have food in my room. So it was either stop buying things I liked, or buy thinks I liked and hide them. That went on until I moved out..Now I live with my husband after 3 years of living alone and I loved not having to share my food or see something I looked forward to being gone. It started happening again with my husband. Now to his credit he will give it three days, but sometimes you want to make something last more than three days. Like ice cream, or a box of Oreos. On multiple occasions I've fussed him out for eating my food and he never understood why I got so angry until he went to my parents house with me for a week. There the same thing happened. I bought a family size pack of Oreos which has 48 cookies in it. They were gone in less than an hour (I had 4). Despite that, he said that I still am a bit of an asshole for fussing at him for eating my food.EDIT: to clear up some confusion our finances are not entirely tied up together. We keep some money to ourselves to buy specific things we want so that it will not mess with the bill money. Like Amazon money, or whatever. I buy my snacks with that money.",207,91,2020-07-14 00:26:32
101,NTA,AITA for asking my girlfriend [23F] to consider quitting a job that bothers me?,"Before anyone gets upset, I am not insisting that she quit this job, and if she chooses not to, that is her prerogative. I just asked her to consider doing so.My girlfriend, Ana, is currently a law student, her second degree after qualifying in a language degree. During the summer, she works for a family friend named David. She calls her job a personal assistant, but it seems much broader than that - she is his translator and interpreter, she goes to events with business partners as his ""date"" or ""partner"", and when clients visit David at home or go to dinner with him, she entertains their wives and makes drinks or entertains or cooks, etc. When David hosts events, Ana runs them, wrangling guests and arranging seating plans and so on. In essence, it often appears she is a kind of ""hired wife"". I have never encountered a job of this kind before. David is mid-30s and unmarried. Ana has alluded to him hiring escorts when they are abroad. I have never met him, but this made me feel very uneasy.For the whole summer, she is with him - there is a room in his London house she calls her study with a sofa she sleeps on, and they regularly travel abroad together. **I never see her during this time**, she claims to work from 7am to 11pm six days a week and says David does not like her to use her phone during work hours. She also said David does not like her to eat during work hours either but he counts her going to the gym as a valid use of work hours. On top of this are ""business expenses"", such as David buying her clothes. **Even when she is at university**, she is frequently getting phone calls from him at all hours of the night, which she says is due to the time difference.Two nights ago, we had a big fight over this job. I told her she looked like she had lost a lot of weight and she just brushed it off and said she had a stressful job. I said it seemed like a very weird set of duties, and she got defensive it had started out as a more normal job but that she had taken on more duties as David had started to depend on her. How much can he depend on her when she's still at university for a third of the year? She let slip during this conversation David was funding her law degree and paying her a stipend **even when she was not working**, and I told her that I found the whole arrangement to be very suspicious, asking if she was sure it wasn't something sketchy or that she wasn't being exploited in some way, not saying in what way.  I told her she might want to reconsider a job which basically turned her into a non-sexual escort and that I was uncomfortable with the whole thing.She shut me down and told me that I was being a controlling AH and that her job was her own, and that even suggesting she consider what a weird occupation she had was a massive dick move on my part. But me, I genuinely feel like I'm going crazy anytime I try to explain her job to others... and even when I think about it myself.**FAQ:**1. I have known her for five years, dating for three. We live together while studying with four other roommates. She has had this job since before we started dating, and David was always her quirky boss that she would have anecdotes about. 2. David knows her family and is close to her older cousins, from what she has mentioned it. Ana and David are both Russian. His family is much wealthier than hers, if I understand correctly. Her family know she has this job, and think it is great.3. She includes this work on her CV. She is on the books to some degree, as she gets her weekly salary into her account and bonuses in cash, from what I understand. The clothes she gets are nice but not flashy, just normal work clothes like blouses and pants or neat dresses. I do not know if they are designer. She has the occasional very nice cocktail dress from an event that she either sells for extra cash or keeps for other events. I do not know if it is from a high-end label. 4. There is a possibility, mentioned elsewhere, that she may be misrepresenting the eating rules due to her history of disordered eating. This is something I intend to discuss with her.5. You can stop telling me she's likely having sex with David. There are 800+ comments here saying something similar, and it isn't particularly relevant to the discussion. **Mini-update:** we spoke briefly on the phone this morning before she started work. She apologised for flipping out, saying that she was stressed and unwell. I said I wanted to bring her and David out for lunch to clear up this misunderstanding and apologise for being controlling. She went off the phone to speak to someone and came back on and said David wanted to have me for dinner, presumably not in the Hannibal sense. She said she would get back to me by the end of the day with a day and time that works, so if she doesn't, well, I don't know.&#x200B;",4165,931,2020-07-15 15:14:30
772,NTA,AITA for refusing to talk to some family members after they left me(22F) alone in the street at 1am ?,"  First of all, for a bit of context, I live in a moderately conservative Muslim country. Yesterday I 22F was out with two of my cousins 19F & 25F, and two other girls. At around 12/30am we were heading back home, we're a group of women, so even if the street is empty, it would be okay because we can still defend ourselves as a group. My other cousin 21M was supposed to pick us up, but he was running late, and when we were a bit close to my house (around a 10min walk), he came, he pulled up with my aunt in the car, I was going to go in, but then my 19F cousin looked at me and said ""we're heading the other way, do you want to take a taxi or walk home?"" and my aunt was staring at me, she didn't offer me a ride or anything. Naturally, I was like ""okay"" and just walked back home by myself.I wouldn't say I live in a bad area, but being alone at 1am on a Tuesday night is still very dangerous, I was getting cat called every step I took, guys in cars were pulling over and honking for me to get in (I guess?) and I couldn't see any other girls except for a couple of night workers. On my way home, I sent a voice note to my cousin saying that what happened wasn't cool, and if it were my dad, he wouldn't have left anyone of them walk home at that hour, she was saying that ""I shouldn't blame her and that I should've stuck around to understand the situation"", but there isn't anything they could've told me that could've excused them abandoning me like that. When I got to my neighbourhood my father was waiting for me at the entrance and he berated me and called me a variety of names because I got home late. Needless to say, I didn't appreciate that.This morning they all came over for something unrelated, and they knocked on my door to see me, but I didn't want to talk to any of them, I just went out of my room to get some stuff and just said hi to everyone from a distance. They came over tonight as well, but I ran away to my friend's place to spend the night there.Both mom and dad are telling me that I'm rude and impolite for my behaviour towards them, but I think I'm actually being very nice given the situation. Do you think I over-exaggerated, or is my behaviour totally understandable?",40,31,2020-07-15 23:22:56
581,YTA,AITA for lying about where I'm from and my ability to speak English and Russian?,"I am American and I go to university in Lithuania, I spent the first year learning Lithuanian so the following year I can start my undergraduate in Lithuanian. The problem is, most young people (those under 30 i'd say) speak English in the big cities, Kaunas, Vilnius and Klaipeda, while everyone also speaks Russian, and most of the older people and occasionally younger people speak Polish as well, though that's mainly just in Vilnius and some border areas. Whenever I tried to speak Lithuanian, they hear my accent and just respond in English which was fucking annoying, then when i went to a small village i got berrated by the people there for speaking shit Lithuanian. At parties, whenever anyone asked where I was from and said America they'd all want to speak to me in English and have me improve their English and I got asked everyday, why the hell would i study here and not in America. I got so sick of this shit from now on I started telling people I was Bulgarian and I didn't speak English.Most of the other foreigners don't have this problem, nobody asks the Indians, Ukrainians or others why they're here.  Whenever I was anywhere, shop, train station, whatever and someone asked me where I'm from I always said Bulgarian or I just told them I can't speak English. Well eventually it caught up to me, as I told all my friends I made that I Bulgarian becuase I didn't want them to speak to me in Lithuanian. Look I know what you're going to say, you should just ask them to speak to you in Lithuanian, which I've tried before when I was doing a summer program in another city and nobody cared, they just kept speaking English becuase it was easier, which prevented me from learning it, and making good Lithuanian friends and being in a Lithuanian friend group, I didn't want to be a part of the expat groups.  Since all my friends are Lithuanians here, we only spoke to each other in Lithuanian which greatly improved my Lithuanian to the point where I no longer have issues speaking it and nobody ever tries to speak to me in English when i talk to them in Lithuanian. Recently, my mom called me and my friends heard me speaking perfect English, as its my native language, and they started accusing me of being a spy and all sorts of shit and they were fucking pissed as hell to which I confessed. Half of them thought it was fucking hilarious but the other half don't trust me anymore and its tearing our friend group apart.",57,25,2020-07-14 14:17:02
585,NTA,AITA For Getting an Apartment Without Consulting My Grandparents,"Hey guys, my girl doesnt have an account so Im posting this on her behalf. A little context. My GF is 22, just graduated nursing school at the end of last year and was fortunate enough to almost immediately get hired at a hospital. For the first time ever shes capable of being totally financially independent. Her grandmother and her aunt have basically been the financial support that got her through nursing school, loaning her money for classes, books, buying her a car, and even taking in her German Shepherd when he was no longer welcome at her house. All things that gf is very grateful for and has been paying back whenever she has extra money. Its worth mentioning that her family has a history of being manipulative, and sometimes gossiping and lying behind each others backs to turn favor to or against some family member, a habit that both gf and I find exhausting. Also worth mentioning that gf has a shifty relationship with her mom, being sometimes on really good terms and sometimes really bad terms (mostly due to her moms psychology but thats not entirely relevant here I dont think). Now let me tell you about the issue. Last weekend her grandma said she has until the end of August to find a place for her dog, either gf gets her own place or pays her stepdad to let her keep the dog at home. Not entirely out of reason either the pups a lot of work. Her stepdad absolutely does not want the dog back and no amount of money will change his mind so looks like shell be apartment hunting. Well just today, my gf found, applied for, and got approved for an apartment that would be perfect for her in price range, space, and being close to family and work! Amazing right?! I guess not. Both her grandma and aunt are entirely infuriated and - as they say - emotionally distraught that they were not consulted or asked for help beforehand. More so, they kept mentioning that they were insulted that gfs mom (whom shes been on good terms with all year but was not on good terms throughout all nursing school) was the first to find out and celebrate with her (there really wasnt much more celebrating than omg you got the apartment how great). They arent even answering messages or calls other than to say how hurt and disappointed they are that they were never consulted or given the chance to help, and are now being tossed aside now that gf has income even tho they helped her throughout all her nursing career. On top of everything, the apartment wont be ready until late September, and theyre now saying that the dog has to be out by end of August and shell have to figure out where to keep him in the interim. Me personally think that they are emotionally gaslighting her, but to what end I dont knowy. Gf is feeling really good about this new apartment and this new change, and is overall very happy and excited with her decision, but she has lingering doubts on whether she acted out of line. We both really wanted outside opinions. So Reddit, is she the asshole?",56,15,2020-07-10 05:48:59
494,YTA,AITA for wanting to be in my daughter's wedding planning?,"41F, I'm a mother of two but only my eldest daughter is relevant here, she is is 23.When my daughter was 15, she came out to me as a lesbian. I deeply regret my reaction but it was out of surprise more than hatred. We have no gays or lesbians in the family so it was a first. Plus she was and still is my baby girl and it upset me to realize she is thinking about sexual relationships already enough to realize she has a different sexuality. My other child is a boy too so I was also expecting to do plenty of things only with my daughter, talking about boys (when she'd be a bit older), then marriage planning, etc...So that day I said things I regret, that it was just a phase, she was doing it to spite me. She was very rebellious too at the time so that's why I assumed. I now know it wasn't a phase, and I wish I could go back in time. I now fully accept my daughter's sexuality and she is in a relationship with a good woman.They are getting married in about two years. And as we were talking about it (via texts) ... I was informed that I would not be involved in the planning. At all. No dress shopping, nothing. I'll be a guest. I was extremely upset and asked why... She said she hasn't forgiven me for the way I treated her when she came out. She said I said things that can't be forgiven, so I asked what things and she told me, and I can guarantee I NEVER said those things. She also said we weren't close anyway. She moved away in another country so it's not my fault.I asked who would do the mother of the bride parts of the wedding then, trying to make her realize it was absurd to exclude your own MOTHER. She said it would be her MIL. That she was closer to her MIL than me. It broke me. I'm not even my own daughter's mother in her eyes.I refuse to attend a wedding to watch some travesty where another woman plays mom with my daughter, so I told her I wouldn't attend unless I get my proper role in it, and she left me on read. My husband and son are furious with me. Aita? I can't bear thinking of watching my daughter's great day from the sidewalk like I'm irrelevant in her life...",91,135,2020-07-13 05:03:37

As im walking away she screamed ""DAD ISNT GOING TO HAVE AN OBITUARY BECAUSE OF YOU"" I told her not to use that against me and she said that she was.I walked outside and my mom made me come back inside to which i was met with more yelling and we then spiraled into a pissing match. It ended with me just walking away fuming i was absolutely fucking pissed because she used my dads death to guilt trip me. I left and went to a friends house and am cooling down.

467,YTA,AITA for insulting my gay brother after he said yes to a date with my female friend?,"My parents invited My brother (22M) for dinner as we hadn't seen him in a while. I (20F) was weirded out because he brought his roommate to a family dinner. Halfway through the night he drops the 'boyfriend' bomb. See my best friend had asked my brother on a date (just the earlier that day!) and he said yes. She's has terrible insecurity, confidence, body image issue and has bad anxiety so that was a big thing for her. Now I was finding out he was gay and had a boyfriend. I insulted him and called him names (not homophobic slurs) because I couldn't believe he would do that to someone I consider a sister.He said he felt really put on the spot when she asked and people where around and he didn't want to embarrass her. He said he was going to explain to her tomorrow that he was gay, which is why he was coming out to us now. He'd already told his boyfriend and I made him call her up right then and let her down.My mom said I was too harsh on him after just coming out and in front of his boyfriend.",107,51,2020-07-11 04:51:34
265,NAH,"AITA for not wanting to compromise with my GF on what dog breed we get together, and then saying we aren't ""Mature"" enough for a dog since we can't agree?","My (25/M) girlfriend (26F) and I have been dating for around 2 years, and living together for about 6 months now. While the world has been going crazy due to the whole quarantine thing, we've been doing pretty well, and so we decided to talk about getting a dog. It's been something we've discussed before, I've only ever lived with cats and have always wanted a dog, because I like the idea of having a dog to run and play with and be active with, while my GF only ever had interactions with dogs through her grandmother, who kept a pair of a small dogs to keep her company.&#x200B;Now here's the problem, I've always wanted a more active breed, in fact I would love a breed like a husky (I know they can be a lot of work, but I want a dog I can exercise with), but my GF wants a lap dog like her grandmother had, in fact she has been talking about getting a Pomeranian (she says she's been in love with them ever since she saw Fran Drescher having one on The Nanny). I really do not want a small dog breed though, I have really zero interest in them, and my GF says she doesn't want a dog that will jump on her and be rowdy if we can't give it all the attention it needs.&#x200B;The issue is, neither of us really don't want to compromise, she wants her small dog, I want an active dog, and we have actually started to fight about it. Like just raising our voices, but still, it's probably been more heated than anything we've ever fought about before. She raises some good points, we live in an apartment right now, although there are plenty of parks and dog areas I could take a husky or athletic breed to so he wouldn't be cooped up, and I point out dogs are a 10+ year commitment, and we aren't planning on living in an apartment forever. She tries to argue that we could get her breed first to ease us into owning a dog, and then discuss getting a breed for me in a couple years ... but that just feels like she gets what she wants with a ""maybe"" I'll get what I want, plus again I honestly worry if we have a little dog then an active husky puppy down the road it could be too rough trying to play with the smaller one. ""We already have a small dog, a big dog would bully her"".&#x200B;I told her at one point if she got a lap dog then I wouldn't consider it ""my dog"" and wouldn't want to be responsible for it, and she got angry, saying I am being immature about it since it was supposed to be ""our dog"". I told her that if neither of us can compromise then maybe we aren't mature enough in our relationship for a dog then, and she got more angry. Now she's giving me the cold shoulder and talking about going to stay with her parents for awhile, but with the quarantine we might be stuck together and things have just gotten tense. I just feel like if we can't agree on a breed, then if we do get a dog, one of us will be resentful.&#x200B;AITA for refusing to compromise on getting a small dog, even though I don't want one? AITA for saying we aren't mature enough to share a dog since we can't agree?&#x200B;EDIT: So everyone seems to agree I'm TA for wanting a husky just because they ""look cool"", and I totally see everyone's point in that. I did some ""research"" initially, but mostly just searching online for ""things to know before you get a husky"" and lots of husky pictures (lol), but really, I was not actually prepared, and our apartment is most definitely not ready for one either. I did talk to my GF some, I admitted I was dumb for wanting a husky but I said I still think we should plan on waiting a couple more months on the dog thing. I did show you some pictures of a Jack Russel Terrier though since many of you guys have suggested one, and she said ""awww!"" so I think that's a good sign. Also mentioned adopting or even dog sitting instead of buying a puppy outright to start. We are not going to be moving forward on the dog right now but I think we are in a better place. I think we both were just being kinda bullheaded about what we wanted (and me painfully underinformed)! Thank you all for being informative furparents, even the ones who raked me over the coals for wanting a ""cool"" husky in my apartment, ha ha!&#x200B;Edit 2: So everyone is giving their opinions on their favorite breeds, and what is best for beginners, even people who originally said Russel Terriers would be a good option, others are saying they are headstrong and also very energetic. I can't reply to everyone, but I want to thank everyone! We are still going to wait awhile, and the suggestion some of you made to take in a dog temporarily through dog sitting is a great idea, but you guys have shown both of us (both me and my GF) that we have a lot more research to do. I really got hung up on wanting what I want, and sort of didn't think it through. There are so many awesome breeds you guys are suggesting! Although the more I hear about everyone talking about rescues, I am really personally leaning towards that and I'm pretty sure I can get my GF on board as well, thanks guys!",591,331,2020-07-14 23:47:44

This wasnt a normal door hold, mind you. She was at least 15 feet away from the door pushing a cart.I knew that she would have trouble getting the cart in the door, not being automatic. I gave her plenty of time to say it.She muttered thank you under her breath after I said your welcome loudly. But it seemed sarcastic.

564,YTA,WIBTA for reporting a neighbor to the leasing office for opening my mail?,"Disclaimer: my apologies for any spelling errors, Im writing this at work as it just happened I am a freshmen in college, my first semester starts in two weeks. Ive worked since I was 15 years old to pay for my first car, tuition and books. So I manage my finances pretty well. I did pretty well and high school and was able to receive a couple of scholarships + my family is pretty large so they helped contribute to my first semester of college to help me out just a bit. However, I paid my first semester out of pocket because I did not realize that tuition deferment allowed me to wait until my scholarships cleared first. So I have been waiting for about 2 weeks to receive a reimbursement check. Well today at work my mom came into my job and she seemed pretty upset. I stepped outside and she hands me an envelope with a check from the financial aid office at my university. It was opened so Im kind of like Wtf. because my mom doesnt open my mail. Then she tells me that one the neighbors in our complex opened it then knocked on our door. This makes me feel uneasy because all of my sensitive documents will get sent to my mothers house when I am living on campus.WIBTA if I reported the neighbor that opened my mail to the leasing office in my complex?",58,52,2020-07-11 23:13:58
71,NTA,AITA for not showing my baby on video chat to my mother?,"English is not my first language. I (f29) moved to a different country 5 years ago to be whit my fiance (m42). 3 weeks ago I gave birth to our first child Now I understand my parents to be enthusiastic about there second grandchild and because of covid they can't travel to see her. That's why video chat comes in handy, only my mom demand to video chat twice a day or even more. I told her that's to much because I'm trying to get a schedule in for her and myself. I breastfeed the baby and she is a slow either so it cost loads of time (I pump as well but I prefer her on the breast) anyhow to get back to the point, today my mother called me (4th time that day) I picked up and asked what she wanted. She said she is whit her client at work and show off the baby. I said no, she is eating and I'm not comfortable whit showing the camera always up into her face. She needs peace and quietness while eating. So she demanded I taken her off the breast and cover up to show the baby to her client, someone I never met, because she is a old lady and want to see the baby. I said no again and say show her a picture of her. My mom got angry and hanged up, now she is blowing up my phone about how disrespectful I am as a daughter and how disappointed she is in me. I got angry myself and this is where I can be the AH, if she doesn't apology and see reason I am no longer video chatting whit her and she only can see her on a picture.

215,ESH,WIBTA for letting the child I gave up 18 years ago in my life against the wishes of her father?,"Over 18 years ago when I was 15 I became pregnant with my high school bfs baby. I did not want to keep the baby and my parents agreed to let me get an abortion if that was what I wanted. I told my high school bf who was 17 at the time that I was pregnant but planed to have an abortion. He did not take this well and ran to his parents to try and stop me. Him and his parents begged for me to keep the baby. At the time I was young and easily manipulated. After some time of begging I agreed to carry the baby to term if they paid for everything and then took the baby. When the baby was born I signed my parental rights away with no regrets and all parties agreed I would have no contact with the child. I have had no regrets from giving the child up. I went to college and have made a successful career. Met the love of my life and have had two children with him in my own time. But 2 months ago I received a Facebook message from the child I gave up 18 years ago. She asked if I was her biological mother and I told her the truth. She asked to meet me and I said yes. After meeting we discussed the situation I had been in and she told me she had no anger but only sadness for how things turned out. She told me about her childhood and said her father was a great father to her and she had a great step mother. She ended up telling me her father had no clue she had contacted me. I told her that she should tell her father the truth because he did raise her. She agreed and asked me if we could stay in contact and I agreed. To be honest even though I had no regrets from my decision and was happy to see this girl had an amazing life, I saw no reason to exclude her from mine if we both agreed to a healthy adult relationship. I had no plans to be her mother and made this clear and she understood. But only a week after our first meet up I got a very angry call from her biological father. He told me I had no right to be in her life now. I told him I didnt necessarily disagree but she was the one that sought me out and it would be cruel to deny her. This of course only made him angry. I tried to assure him I wasnt trying to take a parental stance in her life and he had nothing to worry about but he didnt care. He told me I needed to stay true to our agreement and stay away from his kid. Ever since then I had only talked to the girl through text. Every time she asks to meet up I give her an excuse. I feel awful giving her the run around but I dont want to hurt her relationship with her father and step mother. WIBTA for letting this girl into my life more?EDIT/Update: I very much agree that I should not be lying to her. I honestly really would like a relationship with her as long as she wants one with me. I have contacted her and asked to go to dinner this weekend! I hope I can communicate whats been going on in my mind lately and be as honest as possible with her!

I do not know the nature of their relationship and I have met the girlfriend only one time, but I know that in her mind it is a committed relationship. My friend, on the other hand does not treat it like one and every time we go out, he tries to cheat on his girlfriend by picking up random girls at the bar. Last weekend, he bought drinks for two girls and brought them to our table at the bar. I realized what he was trying to do and he knows that while I do not interject myself into his relationship I do not approve of cheating. So I mentioned ""Hey (friend's name), I think these girls would love to see that adorable picture of you, your girlfriend and kids from the other day that you showed me."" The girls looked at one another, walked away, and my friend got very angry at me. He accused me of ""cock blocking"" whatever that is and would not speak to me for the rest of the night. When I told this story to another friend, she said I really should be telling his girlfriend that he is trying to cheat, even though I do not know her and do not want to inject myself into a dramatic situation where there are kids involved.AITA?

MIL and FIL have their own room. SIL and BIL will have their own room, and their three kids (under age of 12) will share another room. It wasn't until I explained the set up to a close friend of mine they pointed out - is SIL covering more of the cost since her three kids all have a separate room? Everyone going on holiday is paying the same cost (for example we've all put in 500 per family).Edit to say - I haven't said a thing to her yet but brought it up to my husband and he didn't think it was a big deal. I say specifically SIL because me and SIL have been the ones planning this trip.",19,32,2020-07-09 20:07:47
346,NTA,AITA for refusing a DNA test for my daughter?,"So my boyfriend and I have been together for about 6 years now, and we share a 2 year old daughter. Before I met him, I was in a serious relationship that was extremely abusive - and I haven't seen my ex bf for a few years - but while I was out eating with my daughter and my MIL a old mutual friend of my ex and I's saw me and as she was saying hi, she took one look at my daughter and asked if that was my ex and I's kid. I let her know that we never had any kids, and that she's 2. After I told her that she laughed and said ""Damn, she looks like him for some reason,"" which IMO was extremely rude...esp. because she knew that we had been broken up for a long time and my daughter was still really young. When she left my MIL was making jokes about it saying ""I never knew you guys had a secret baby,"" and then she started to ask me when was the last time I saw him. I answered with ""I don't really even remember but it has got to be at least 3 years ago. "" I explained to her that I saw him in passing once, and it was an awkward moment because it was in Walmart and she kind of laughed it off. FF to Wednesday and me and my bf are having lunch and he asks me if I would ever take a DNA test for him...I answered ""No, I wouldn't see the point -"" but that if he wanted me to I certainly would, and I would also feel offended - the same way he would if I asked to check his phone records going back 5 years. He told me I was being irrational, and when I asked why he even randomly asked me that he said that his mom had ordered a DNA test and wanted him to have me conduct it on the baby because people have been telling her she doesn't look anything like her. A little background.. my daughter looks like both of us, I am black and he is white with hazel eyes - she is caramel, brown eyes and has curly hair that has blonde highlights while my MIL is blonde haired and blue eyed. He and his mother look nothing alike and him asking for a DNA test would insinuate that I cheated on him 2 years ago, which also offends me. For now, I am refusing the DNA test almost as a way to protest him offending me in such a way but then I also feel like it makes me look guilty. I told my best friend about it and she said I should just take the test and then take a break from the relationship because that means he didn't trust me. I tried to explain to him how it almost feels like my ex is still abusing me by having me be questioned, and having our kid be questioned and it seemed like it registered to him. We curbed the discussion after I explained that to him but now his mom is texting me about it saying she spent so much money on the test and she needs to know for her own sanity, which is making me upset again. Am I the asshole here for refusing the DNA test?UPDATE: My bf and his mother got into it pretty bad last night. He told her she was a bitch for always trying to make his gfs feel like shit so they will leave him and that her shady past has blurred her vision on how relationships work. She told him I was probably sleeping around to get over my ex...even though it was at least 5-6 years since we had already broken up, and that she DEMANDED a test before she kept treating her like a grandbaby. He told her we will not be talking to her ever again and that she needs to ask his dad for a test because she sounds like shes projecting.",277,203,2020-07-11 00:58:47
153,NTA,AITA for not giving my brother any inheritance money?,"Backstory:My brother (27M) and I (23M) have been raised by a single dad. Mom died when we were teenagers and these were dark times.My bro was very close to our mom and her death really messed him up and he started doing drugs. Im not anti-drugs, but he did some pretty fucked up shit and I lost a lot of respect for him when his addiction pretty much took over his life after a few years. It felt like I had lost my brother.Our dad tried his best to get him help but he just kept relapsing and relapsing, it was bad. He gave him an ultimatum, either stop doing drugs and be a part of this family or continue and be disowned. Ofc he chose the latter and basically told us to go fuck ourselves.My dad unfortunately passed away about a year ago and I was the sole inheritor. He left me a hefty sum that I really dont need since I already own a pretty successful business. I was planning on investing it or just donate it to people who really need it.The problem arises when my bro contacts me (mind you we hadnt talked for a few years) and asks me if he could have some of dads money because he really needed it. Knowing his problem with drugs, im a little skeptic and asks him if hes still using. He tells me no but I dont really believe him so I ask him if hed be willing to do a drugs test. If it came back negative, I would give him half.He then gets really fucking mad, cursing me for not believing him, calling me selfish and greedy. We got into a heated argument and he finally admitted he was still in fact using (no shit) but he needed money to get his life back on tracks. I eventually told him he wouldnt see a cent unless he got 100% clean. He got pissed off yet again and told me to go fuck myself (again).I really want to see my bro get his life back and im sure this money could really help him. But I dont trust him and definitely do NOT want to contribute to his addiction. I would never forgive myself if he ODd because of the money I gave him. And also, I still see it as my dads money. He didnt put him in the will for a reason and I feel like Id be betraying my dads wish to see his son get clean if I gave him money even though hes still using.Sorry if some sentences dont make sense, im a little drunk.AITA?Edit: Thanks to everyone who took time to answer, yall are awesome!Ill have a conversation with my bro within the next few days to discuss our future and the possibility of him getting into rehab with the inheritance money. Therapy will also be needed. Dont worry, im not giving him a cent unless he gets clean.  Ill probably put the money in a trust anyway, ill talk to my lawyer too.

S is very social and popular while L isnt as social or popular. Shes much more interested in books and studying than S is. S wanted a Sweet 16 party. We helped her plan a very large party and invited all her family and friends. It was expensive but well worth it because S had the best day of her life. My mother helped us plan and pay for the party as well. Ls 16th birthday is coming up and we asked if she wanted a party like the one S had. L had absolutely zero interest in having a party like that and wanted a small get together with close family instead. My mother called L the other day to ask about her Sweet 16 and asked her when they could start planning it. When L told her she wasnt going to have a party like that my mom got upset and started to try and pressure her into having one. L eventually agreed so her grandmother would stop pressuring her. After talking to L my mom called me and this was our conversation.Mom-When do you want to have Ls Sweet Sixteen?Me-L told me she doesnt want to have a Sweet Sixteen and just wants to have a small thing instead?Mom-Well she just told me she wanted to have one. Every girl should have a Sweet Sixteen. She was reluctant but I brought her around.Me-Ill talk to L again and if shes changed her mind than of course we can have one.Mom-We should just plan one anyways. L needs to learn to be more social like S and stop burying her head in books.Me-No she doesnt. Shes perfect just the way she is.Mom-Well its unfair of you to give S a Sweet Sixteen and not L. Me-L doesnt want to have one. Bye mom.My mom then goes on to post a couple really passive aggressive posts on her Facebook about how all girls love Sweet Sixteens and how depriving them of that is wrong. According to L shes been sending her texts about planning her Sweet Sixteen and what she wants her theme to be and everything. My mom thinks that since Ls party will be so much cheaper than Ss Sweet 16 than its unequal treatment. AITA for treating my daughters unequally?",63,62,2020-07-14 19:50:36

We all had a bit of a laugh and we moved on to normal conversation. The server brought our drinks out, just 3 as Lisa wasnt here when we ordered them. I took a sip of mine and mentioned how nice it was and pleased I ordered it. Lisa asked the server for a minute so she could decide what to order.She then turned me and and asked if it was that nice and I said yes, she then asked for a quick sip. I said no, gross and laughed a little. She looked a little puzzled and asked why not? I just said Id rather not after what you had just done, still joking and said with a laugh, the other 2 were laughing as well. Lisa then got a really pissed look on her face and said she couldnt believe Id say something like that and Im embarrassing her. She started to get up and gather her things visibly upset. I tried to calm the situation down and said its no big deal sit down and lets have our lunch. She ignored me and left the table, Joey got up and chased after her.

He's 35 and lives with his mother, which sucks, I get that. But the thing is, this guy is a huge slob. She and I have separate bathrooms, and hers is connected to her room which means mine is the one he's using, and I've had to clean it three times this week. He won't lift the toilet seat before he pees (which I've talked to him about two or three times now), he leaves tags from his clothes everywhere, leaves body wash spilled all over the bathtub, and tracks in all kinds of dirt and other nastiness onto the floor. He also leaves trash all over the house, puts cigarette butts in his pockets (or something? I'm not really sure) and then they fall out all over the house, and just doesn't clean up after himself in general. Dude also has literal bags of stuff all over the house. Clothes, toys from his kids (who have only been here twice, it's not like he's got them over all the time) and three or four pairs of shoes. And honestly, all of his stuff stinks, he doesn't shower very often and his feet smell awful. He also has no idea when to stop talking, and will flat out interrupt people mid sentence to talk about whatever crosses his mind. My roommate likes having him here because she says he entertains her 6 year old, which is true. He has a switch and shares it with the kiddo. And he is genuinely fun to be around a lot of the time (and in small doses) but I'm getting tired of him being here. It feels like he's trying to covertly move in, and that honestly makes me really angry. She's suggested that he keep his stuff in the spare room so it's not in my way, but I honestly don't want to make him any more comfortable being here than he already is. He's already incredibly disrespectful in how he treats my home, and if he gets too comfortable then he's not going to want to leave. He's got a job, and makes decent money, he needs to find his own home and stop expecting other people to take care of him.So WIBTA if I ask her to stop letting him stay here?

After she had our twins, I ended up taking a consulting job that involved being out of town during most weekdays. She was always angry because the creams she bought and diets she did never worked. She was upset about the job, and during lockdown me and her got into it and I admitted to her that I sometimes look at pictures of us when she was 21 and cry.After the quarantine lifted, I traveled to another state to complete a project for the last three weeks and just got back home. I immediately noticed something different about my wife that gave me a pretty unpleasant feeling. I couldnt put my finger on specifics except for the fact that her eyes looked more cat like.I forward a video of my wife to my sister and she confirms that it was obviously Botox. At breakfast this morning I comment to my wife that she looks frozen and asked if the doctor could take some out or something. She retorts I wanted her to look younger and I say this is not the solution since she doesnt look younger, just strange. My wife burst into tears. We were supposed to go to the mall to buy clothes for our eight year old, and I ended up taking her alone but she was pouty the entire trip. AITA?

271,YTA,AITA: My wife recently started working again and needs to be up early but likes to goof off late at night so I tried to remind her she needs rest and she got mad at me,"My wife has spent the past 10 years or so being a stay-at-home mother to our 3 kids. She wanted to help out with household expenses more so she started working as an in-home assistant for her mother. She's paid to do this but it's not much (about 1/3 what I make) and it's part-time. I don't mind any of that. A few nights ago we were getting ready for bed as it was quite late and she decided she wanted to have a tickle fight. I gently reminded her that she needs to get some sleep as she hasn't been sleeping well lately. She pouted some and then went right back to it. I reminded her again and then she got upset. She said I was boring and she just wanted to have fun with me. I explained that I just wanted to make sure she got enough sleep for work the next day. She's been somewhat cold to me since then but I really do want to make sure she gets her rest. AITA for suggesting she calm down and sleep?&#x200B;Info: I work full-time from home and will be doing so for the forseeable future. I wake first and prepare things such as coffee and breakfast, tend to the dogs, etc. If she did this at a more reasonable hour I'd be 110% down because I am a tickle master. 12:30am, 1am? I'm sorry but that's a bit late to be doing this.She's complained that she has trouble staying awake at work at times due to her getting used to working again and waking up earlier than she was accustomed to. She hasn't lashed out at me or the kids as a result of being tired but I can see it dragging on her.&#x200B;UPDATE: So it would seem the consensus is I am TA for treating her as a child with reminding her she needs to get some sleep. I can agree with this assessment and I thank all those for their insights. To those who suggested it'd lead to smexy time... It rarely does, we have other activities that lead to a good romp. We've talked about it and agreed to just let each other do. If she's sleepy the next day, well, that's on her. We've also been working on helping her stay asleep as that's also been an issue. The fix seems to be keeping our bedroom as cold as we can is a major factor. We live in South Texas and the central in our home isn't as good as it can be. We augmented it with a window unit and its helped SOOO much. She's even dreaming again!",510,147,2020-07-11 16:12:43

My daughter is normally very patient with him but this time he wouldnt give her toy back. She then decided to yank it back by sticking her arm between the gaps of the fence. She then sat with her back against the fence and played with her toys. She just stopped playing with him and ignored him but this upset him greatly and so he tried to get her back for not playing. He then took out his penis and peed straight on to her head. My daughter lost it and was so angry that she couldnt even formulate any words. He ran into his home. She just walked angrily up and down the balcony muttering things to herself. She then peed in her toy bucket and waited while still wet with his piss. She waited until he got close enough and it didnt take long, it took less then a minute before he was close enough and she dumped the bucket of piss over his head. She then walked in the our home shouting mom I pied on him and dont care if I get punished. She then explained everything to me and I then checked my security camera to see what happened.About 20/30 minutes later or so the boys mother was screeching from her balcony that I should punish my child for peeing on her kid. I told her that her kid started it and my kid finished it. She was adamant my kid was the one who started it. I showed her my security camera recording. She then said that I needed to punish my kid too teach the kids that they were both wrong. I told her I wouldnt and she felt it was unfair my kid would avoid punishment.She said that I was being asshole for not punishing her and I simply dont agree.This all happened in maybe 4/6 minutes as I went to the bathroom, I dont just leave my kid all alone for long periods.",168,80,2020-07-14 01:26:20

He got in while I wasn't home, so he knew that he was going behind my back and watching it without my permission. He was halfway through Tiger King when I confronted him about it, and his only response was ""Tiger King is for adults."" So basically he was calling me a kid (I'm 20, so legally an adult in my state) and justifying himself stealing my netflix account because ""I shouldn't have been watching Tiger King anyway"". I changed my password and kicked him off, and he got really angry. He threatened to kick me off the family music account (I don't really care about that because I can literally get it on spotify free) and to not let me drive the family car (which is what I take to get to work). His point is that he lets me live in his house and he pays my drivers' insurance so I owe him my netflix password. Is he right, AITA here? (Let me point out, he has plenty of money to pay for his own and if he really REALLY needs to watch Tiger King he can easily get a free trial for a whole month. Not steal his daughter's account.)",64,25,2020-07-12 03:12:45
982,YTA,AITA for emailing a teacher why I shouldn't get a bad grade.,"I've been taking a developmental psychology summer course, both because I needed something to do and because of the craziness of the past few months.For the most part the teacher has been pretty kind overall, and I will freely admit that I am not the best at managing my time, and so left alot of work till late.One of the final assignments that I did not give myself enough time for was a 3 page paper, the instructions of which were to write a paper about advice to parents of young children based on language or cognitive development. I decided to write my paper on a how different parenting styles can have an impact attachment theory in terms if infants. In retrospect I understand that this is not exactly what the instructions were asking for, but in my defense the instructions to this paper were vague at best.The teacher responded to this with a note saying that I had not followed the instructions but it was a good paper, and then gave a grade of 25/75. Since it had put in alot of work I decided to email the teacher, apologizing for not following the instructions and asking for an opportunity to rewrite the paper in order to get a better final grade. I also included 2 main arguments about why my paper could be considered under the umbrella of cognitive development, which was that there is a significant amount of overlap between the disciplines of psychology, and that theories had aspects of other thing in it besides for jsut thr category that it falls under, and that this applies for attachment theory as well. I also argued that since this paper was on advising the parents to actively modify their behavior in order to give their children better skills to succeed in later in life, and that this could fall under cognitive development. I made it clear that I was not trying to change the teachers mind, only defending my disposition, and that I understood it was ultimately their decisions on what grade to give me.This was the response I got back:your argument is ill founded.  You don't get a re-do.  I had considered a grade of 0, which would have meant you failed the course.So reddit,  AITA",16,26,2020-07-09 19:18:52
768,YTA,AITA for feeling jealous of my daughter?,"First, this is a disposable account because my daughter follows me on my other account, also English is not my first language, I regret the errors.By context I had my oldest daughter (18) when my current boyfriend and I were very young, I had many miscarriages for years, until in 2018 I got pregnant with my second daughter (it was a very complicated pregnancy, I was in bed allthe pregnancy and my daughter was born with 7 months). At the beginning of 2019, we had to move to Europe for work reasons and our schedules were very complicated. I work from 11 am to 8:30 pm and my boyfriend from 6 am to 6 pm.My oldest daughter has taken the responsibility of taking care of our baby, without complaining.When she has classes, our baby goes to a kindergarten when I go to work and my daughter picks her up as soon as she leaves high school. Now that it's vacation, I let my oldest daughter sleep until I leave.My oldest daughter is doing an amazing job, she cooks for her and her sister, she cleans the whole house thoroughly every day, she plays with her sister and she is raising her very well. When my boyfriend comes home, my daughter understands that her father is very tired, and she takes her little sister and takes her to the park until I return home and then it is her time to rest.My feelings of jealousy started last week, when they gave me ""vacations"" (I only have to go to work two days a week), being more at home, I realized ... that my baby no longer sees me as his mother , she sees her older sister as her mother, she doesn't want me to feed her, she has to be her sister, I can't make her take a nap, her sister has to put her to sleep, she gets upset if I want to play with her, but she goes and look for his sister to play. If I'm giving her a bath, she stays very still and expressionless, but if it's her sister who bathes her, she can't stop laughing and playing. She doesn't obey me at all, but she obeys her sister, I even feel that she loves her father more than me.All this, to trigger that I treated my older daughter in a bad way, I did not realize that she did it, but she was very abrupt, not very affectionate and cold with her. I didn't realize I was acting this way, until my boyfriend caught my attention for this and told me that he was being an asshole.Am I being a fool for feeling this way?Edit: I am going to clarify a couple of things, when I got pregnant with our second daughter, at that time we had a good economic situation and we worked most of the time at home, in addition to having the rest of our family. Secondly, in our country of origin you cannot have a legal abortion, so if you got pregnant you should have it (the thing is, we thought it would be impossible to get pregnant again, that's why we want a lot when you accidentally get pregnant). I feel that things would be very different if we had not moved, but the move was a very fast situation and we did not have many options, that screwed us up a bit.",28,35,2020-07-13 12:18:56
838,NTA,"WIBTA for advocating my husband keep the entire sum of money left to him after a death in the family, even if it's causing difficulties in familial relationships?"," My (41 F) husband Jorge (44 M) recently got a substantial sum of money willed to him by his mothers (Maggie) partner of 30 years, Bob.Bob was a total curmudgeon, but he and Jorge (my husband) got along really well, since Jorge is pretty easygoing.Jorges older sister, Natalia, hated Bob with a fiery passion, not only for being hard to be around (he could be opinionated and rude, with absolutely no concept of compromise), but because she suspected Bob was verbally abusive to Maggie. However, whenever Jorge talked to his mother about Bob, Maggie always insisted that she was happy being with him. So we took her at her word. Natalia, however, was unconvinced. She believed that her and Jorges mother (Maggie) had made a bad decision in partners, and would often confront Bob about his behavior, hoping that Maggie would leave him. Jorge, on the other hand, tolerated Bob because even though Bob was a jerk to most people, Maggie loved him.Over the years, a rift formed between Natalias own family (she has a husband and two kids), and Maggie and Bob. But Jorge and I would frequently fly out to his mom and Bob for visits, and we felt like they always enjoyed our company. We had differing opinions on things, but Bob was generally very pleasant to us.Recently, Bob died and left his property and most of his money to Maggie. Each of the younger generation of folks in his family, like Natalias children, also got a fair amount. And he unexpectedly left a large sum to Jorge:a settlement that Bob received after an accident that named both Maggie (my MIL) and Jorge (my husband) as beneficiaries. Natalia (my sister-in-law) was left nothing.Now Natalia is upset that Bob left money to Jorge. If no money had been left for my husband, she claims there wouldn't be an issue, but because they are both Maggie's children, she thinks they should receive equal amounts. She claims that Bob is, even now, tearing a rift in the family by not including her, and feels shes the only one who ever stood up to Bob, so its unfair that she should be punished for doing what was right. She sees the fact that she was not named an equal beneficiary in the settlement money as a big old ""Screw You,"" even though her kids were named in the will. She would like us to pool the settlement money and split it with her three ways.Three things:1. Bob did not want Natalia to have any of his money.He didnt like her.2. This money issue is a big source of drama in the family, and is causing my mother-in-law (Maggie) a lot of anxiety. She would like Jorge to keep the money, but is open to splitting it for the sake of keeping the peace. 3. No one in this scenario is in great need of the money, but Natalias family is quite well-off.I will support my husbands decision, but would I be the asshole for advocating that Jorge keep the money that Bob obviously wanted him to have, even though it might do irreversible damage to the family relationship?",23,22,2020-07-09 19:51:53
814,NAH,AITA for not returning the neighbor's cat?,"I live very close to my family (we live on opposite sides of the yard) and we are all currently petless. My sister used to have a dog which passed away several years ago (at 16 - he lived a long and happy life adore by us all) and my one sister uses to have a cat but took her with her when she moved out. My other sister has wanted another dog but lives with my parents and they do not want another dog in the house. We have talked about getting a cat but my parents don't want a cat either.One day this spring a cat literally strolled out of the woods, greeted us, and made itself at home. We assumed it was a stray but after a few inquiries we found out it was the neighbor's cat (who lives about half a mile away). They said the cat often wanders off and is gone for a few days at a time. We assumed they would come get it. They did not. We had some cans of cat food left over from a stray we'd sheltered awhile back so we fed the cat, and then one thing led to another and we bought cat food, treats, toys, beds, etc. We are all in love with kitty. She comes to greet me when I come home from work, spends hours snuggled in our laps, we know just how she likes her ear scratched, etc. She has never been away from the house since she arrived. She sleeps on the porch and on the windowsill aND acts like she owns the place. :)My mom messaged the neighbor a few weeks later and reminded them that the cat was still here and said that we were all enjoying loving on her. Neighnor wrote back and said ""Haha, yeah she's not very friendly."" We were taken aback because this cat would literally snuggle 24/7 if we let it so we even sent a pic to xonfirm it was in fact their cat we had (it was).Here's the thing: it's been months. The neighbors drive past our house multiple times a day. I'm of the opinion that we now have a cat. The only reason they had kitty was because the mom work at the animal shelter and couldn't bear to see it put down when it didn't get adopted. They have multiple other rescues the same way and I think they're probably happy to see kitty in a loving home where they don't have to worry about it (plus their comment about her not being very loving makes me think being in a household wit so many dogs was stressing her out). Plus she's not exactly running home or wandering anymore.I want to ask the neighbors to let me know when her last shots were and offer to take her to the vet when due. My mom thinks we should just stay status quo or take her back. She asks what will happen if my sister moves out, but 1) my sister is not considering moving out anytime soon, aND 2) if she did she or I could take the cat as we're both very attached. My mom admits that while she did not want a cat, she enjoys having this one.Aita for wanting to keep the cat?",24,15,2020-07-12 04:11:51
41,NTA,AITA for purposely letting my wife be late for work?,"This happened last year so its no longer a big issue but it comes up from time to time. My wife has a terrible problem getting up in the morning. I mean, its bad. Id honestly rather have my teeth pulled than try and deal with her. Ive spent years coaxing her out of bed, trying to be supportive and understanding, help her develop good habits, but over time, she said I developed into more of a parent. I didnt want that so I backed off. She developed this really annoying habit of setting lots of really annoying alarms every couple minutes so that she is forced to wake up. But they dont work. She sleeps right through them. They wake me up and make my mornings absolutley miserable. I typically wake her up angrily, which I know I shouldnt, but its loud, constant blaring first thing in the mornings and it makes me insane. And its a different alarm every She doesnt even hear it. Ive tried reasoning with her, coming up with compromises, threatening to sleep in the guest bedroom, but nothing works. She says that Im treating her like a child and it makes her feel disrespected. I feel disrespected that I keep getting forcibly woken up and she isnt making a change. One morning I saw her wake up, disable her alarms and go right back to sleep. I had to wake her up so she wouldnt miss work. She didnt remember doing it. One morning, one of her hundreds of klaxons rang in my ear and scared me to death. I turned over and saw her groggily disabling her alarms and rolled back over and went back to sleep. That was the final straw. I did the exact same thing. About an hour goes by before her boss calls her asking where she is. Needless to say she was livid with me when she got home. She said I should have just woken her up, but I held my ground and told her this cycle of behavior was done. Was I TA?",8797,907,2020-07-12 14:37:04

The title doesnt capture it that well. Im marrying the one, shes the best thing thats ever happened to me. The thing is, my parents hate her. Dont just dislike her. *Hate* her. And they arent subtle about it. Ill spare the details, since theyre not relevant to this conflict, but basically my fiance is a different religion and my parents are convinced shes the reason Im no longer religious. (She isnt.) And we had to move for her job, so they blame her for Taking me away from the family. Theyre downright cruel to her. Antagonistic and causing problems. They ruined the last holiday we spent with them to the point that we both left their house crying and had to fly home a week early. We dont see them if we can help it. But heres the thing, I have four younger brothers aged 5-14. I love them, theyre a huge part of my life, and the only other family I have, especially because my parents have alienated themselves from me.I need my brothers in my wedding. I want them to be part of the ceremony. The only way they can come is if my parents bring them. We have no close relatives or friends who could bring them instead. Were only having 20-30 people, most of them her family, so not having my brothers would really make the celebration feel hollow for me. I told my fiance I have to invite my parents in order for my brothers could come. Shes very upset because she thinks if they come theyll ruin the day with cruel comments and their typical insane acts of sabotage.

21,NTA,AITA for for letting my wife talk herself into a hole while I knew the whole time she was wrong?,"Recently I've been having trouble sleeping. I only get around 3-4 hours of sleep a night. I think it's because of stress from work, Corona, and a ton of other stuff going on right now. My wife on the other hand is sleeping 10 hours a day.Because of this I'm up when she's sleeping and she is constantly telling me I'm making noise when I'm not. At first she was texting me saying needed to turn the volume down on the TV or my phone and I would. Soon I figured that I shouldn't use electronics while she's sleeping and stopped, but she still kept texting me. I told her I had turned electronics off and she said I was lying. A few days ago she came into the living room yelling that I wasn't responding to her texts and that I needed to turn the volume on my phone down. I informed her that my phone had died and was currently charging. She accused me of gas lighting her even after I showed her the phone off and charging at less than 5% battery life. Tonight I started getting texts again saying I was listening to music on my phone too loud. I told her she was lying and that she couldn't hear anything. She started saying that I was an asshole and I was has lighting her and that she knew I was listening to music on my phone. I told her that I was indeed listening to music on my phone, and I had it at full volume. I'm only saying that she couldn't hear it. She went on for probably 4 or 5 more texts before I sent her a pin of my location 4 miles away and said, ""I'm on a late night run through the park.

As she was from another country we ended up getting married so that it would be easier for her to live and work her, we've been married now for 6 years and everything was great.Lockdown was hard for my wife as she couldn't find much to keep herself entertained. She started playing a MMO again and this has affected her sleep schedule as she mostly plays with Americans and is awake until 3/4am. She's been furloughed and I'm still working so I've taken over the office whilst she's set up in the living room as I need more space for my work.I've grown out of gaming so I mostly keep myself entertained with exercise, reading, gardening and a bit of DIY in my shed. I've tried to include my wife in things but all she wants to do is play her MMO. She'll usually wake up at 12/1pm and after eating and showering she'll be sat in her den until the early hours of the morning. It was a struggle to ever get her to exercise a bit as she'd be sat down for at least 12 hours. The most contact we'll have is if I sit in the living room and watch TV, even then I have to wear headphones or I'm disturbing her. My issue however has arisen over how close she is getting with some of the people she plays with. She's always talking to people, but I also noticed she'd always texting someone as well. I had a little stalk of her Reddit account and it turns out the MMO she plays has a marriage system in it and she got married to a guy she's been playing with. I confronted her about this which led to an argument about how close she is with this one guy she plays with. She showed me the texts and he's always flirting or trying to get her to send pictures.I asked her if he knew she was married and she said no, her excuse being ""he wouldn't help me in the game if he knew"". I had enough of this and the fact that all she does is play this game for 12 hours a day and told her to quit the MMO.Now she's not talking to me because I'm a ""controlling asshole"".",136,49,2020-07-09 21:42:26
336,YTA,AITA for refusing to give up rights to my biological child?,"I (28M) started a casual, friends with benefits relationship with my friend (28F). She was on the pill and we used condoms every time. She was clear that if she got pregnant, she would consider an abortion but likely not go through with it, and I was very clear that I didn't want a child.Anyways, she's pregnant and keeping it. However, now she's giving me some fucked up ultimatums, saying that she's not okay with a 'deadbeat vacation dad' who pays child support and takes our son off every once in a while for some quality bonding time, but isn't a full-on parent. I asked her what she expects because I'm not exactly planning to marry this woman and raise a kid with her when we're not even in a relationship.She says that once he's finished breastfeeding, she expects shared custody and to have two involved parents, otherwise she wants me to give up my rights and she's going to take *our* son and raise him on her own. She's a doctor and makes double what I do so she doesn't care about child support. She says she doesn't want him to grow up feeling like he wasn't good enough for his dad to stick around and would rather he has one good parent to focus on instead of 1.5.It's ridiculous and manipulative. You can't force somebody to be an involved parent! I've already said I'm more than willing to give child support (I know I have to but keep in mind I don't want a child and don't have a say in the matter, and I've offered more than the minimum I would have to pay. *I'm willing to take responsibility*). There are plenty of men who do their part in child support payments and when they're older and more settled they develop a relationship with their child. I need to keep that option open for myself so I don't have any regrets later. He's my son too at the end of the day. I'm willing to go and at least see him once a month or so right now even when I don't want a child at all. If I give him up then I can't even get *weekend custody* or anything like that later down the line.So my options are either be a full parent or literally *never see my son again*. I think this is bullshit and have refused, but our mutual friend says I'm an asshole for standing my ground on this. I've already consulted a lawyer and have an appointment tomorrow to see if she can even do this (I'm pretty sure she can't) but I wanted to know who's the asshole here because my friend is adamant.",310,198,2020-07-11 02:23:14

My wife (31F) (fake name) Sherry, has been best friends with (fake name) Amanda (31F) since they were in highschool. Sherry considers Amanda the sister she never had ( Sherry has a very complicated family dynamic that Amanda helped her with ). Sherry and I met and started dating in college, shes the love of my life, shes beautiful, kind, caring, and intelligent. We are in the process of trying for a baby (which sparked this conflict). Amanda never liked me all that much, I dont know why, she was always very cold to me, but my wife always said she was just protective of her.  Amanda is also a total rich snob, her dad is some big shot at a tech company, so she lives lavishly even though shes just a assistant professor. She got her degrees from Ivys (which she always brings up when we get into arguments about politics...), always wears super expensive stuff, and gifts my wife luxurious things. For example, she took my wife on a two week trip to Paris for her 30th birthday....which is very generous of her, but Paris is for couples, and I think it was rude of her to not extend the offer to me, because were married.  For my 30th birthday, she gave me a bottle of 30 year aged whiskey...which was nice but Paris????Anyways, Amanda and Sherry were talking about baby stuff, and they started talking about the cost of children, like college fund, extracurriculars, etc. I popped in and joked How much are you putting into the babys college fund since youre acting like the third parent Amanda? and she just laughed it off, which made me kinda pissed, because I think that since shes always calling herself auntie and inserting herself into our business, acting like a parent, she should contribute since shes completely capable of it....So I pushed it a little, and she completely overreacted and said Weird how you always rail at me for being raised as a spoiled princess, but you were the one who grew up to be an entitled prick. which is COMPLTELY unacceptable and incredibly rude.  I told her to get out and never come back and that if she wasnt going to contribute to my childs future, she didnt need to be a part of it. I think Sherry needs to cut her off, were husband and wife first, and Amanda has been completely disrespectful to me, but Sherry disagrees and thinks IM the asshole because she needs Amanda in her life as a friend. I think I need to come first as her husband and that Amanda needs to stay the fuck away from our lives now. What do you think reddit",1370,791,2020-07-12 00:26:18
298,YTA,AITA for refusing to buy my wife a push present?,"I have seen this come up with some of her friends and I thought she might someday ask for one based on how she responded when they got theirs.It started with her dropping not so subtle hints about things she might like. Most were coming in at around a few thousands dollars, so they weren't cheap. I mostly ignored her hints or tried to change the conversation. I refused to have that conversation with her because I thought, and still think, the whole idea is ridiculous.When she saw that her hints were not working, she got more direct and asked me if I had chosen something already or if I was still deciding. That is when I told her I wasn't getting her anything for giving birth. Her gift will be a (fingers crossed) healthy child.She told me that I ""had"" to get her something because this is what people do now and said that she would feel unappreciated if I didn't acknowledge her childbirth experience with a gift and I would be embarrassing her in front of her friends and family. I said that people may do it but it's stupid and did she really want me to buy my baby from her, because that is what this really looks like to me. I told her that while I appreciated everything she had sacrificed to bring our child into this world and knew giving birth was not going to be easy what she was asking was unfair. Why I am supposed to buy her something for a baby we jointly decided to create? Should I expect a gift too? None of it makes any sense.She thinks I am a stubborn asshole for refusing to acknowledge her by buying a push present. I am also an asshole, according to her, because I make more than her friends' husbands and should be more willing to buy a push present because I can afford it.The only reason why I am even writing is because I've never felt like my wife was greedy or unreasonable. This is the first time I can ever remember really thinking she is out of line with her expectations, so it does have me wondering if I might be the asshole and not realize it.&#x200B;AITA?&#x200B;I am editing to add that the price range she is looking at is something in the $4-6K range in terms of cost.Editing again to add that  we usually don't spend more than $1K or $2K on gifts.

911,NTA,AITA for not checking my dad's food?,"Throwaway.So I'm well aware this is a small situation and I know we'll be over it by tomorrow, but I just want to know if I was in the wrong.So little background: I hate mayo. I can eat a lot of things with mayo, like potato salad, chicken salad and (something I'm sad to find out) ranch. But I hate mayo as far as on my sandwiches and stuff. This is something I've picked up from my dad when I was young. He also used to hate may on his sandwiches. Ironically he can now eat lite mayo on his sandwiches which I've tried but now I just hate the texture so I still don't eat them on my sandwiches.Anyway so a couple of days ago he went out to get me Krystals which I've heard is basically ""southern-version of White Castle"" as in they both specialize in the little slider burgers. He said me he told them no mayo, but it still did have mayo on them and *a lot*. I was obviously displeased but I didn't complain about it because obviously it wasn't his fault. I simply just used some napkins to wipe it off and went on with my day.Fast forward to today and he asked me to go get some food for both of us and he'll pay. I said sure, he gave me his order and I leftNow I don't check food *all the time* but I do sometimes, more specifically just to check to make sure my burger doesn't have mayo. But this was one of the times I didn't bother checking. Sometimes it just doesn't be in the forefront of my mind.I get back and give my dad his food and he literally *throws a fit.* Now I'm not sure how exactly you could go wrong with chicken fingers and fries, but apparently they do. But it wasn't the chicken fingers and fries, it was literally because *the sauce.* Usually my dad asks for 2 sauces but I guess because I didn't ask for it (not purposely I just don't usually get my dads food) they only gave one sauce and he had the nerve to say if I did it because I was upset that my food had mayo on it.I told him I didn't and it was just an accident but that I wasn't going back because I it was a long way to go just for some sauce. And literally its over a sauce. He said I still should've checked the bag. Anyway he's been throwing a hissy fit all day and I was just wondering if I was TA.",16,6,2020-07-12 00:26:32
940,NAH,AITA for making my injured sister so upset she wants to leave?,"Usually a lurker only, so forgive any mistakes. People are me (30F) and sister Sarah (34F). Fake names, obviously. For background, my sister Sarah is a difficult, demanding person. She can also be wonderful when shes in a good mood. The problem is you never know how shell react and its caused a lot of issues in our relationship. Because we could both work at home during COVID, we went to stay with our parents and sister, Jen (24). After months of increased conflict, all of us were at our breaking point so Sarah decided to go home. Then she broke her ankle and severely sprained the other one. Sarahs recovering at our parents house and is completely stuck in bed. This means were doing literally everything for her despite the fact were all working. Our days are just work, help Sarah, and try to sleep. Its been nearly two weeks and were all exhausted. This would be difficult at any time; throw in COVID, us already being fed up with each other, and Sarahs demanding ways, and its near impossible. To make everything worse, Sarah constantly complains that we havent done things right. Its truly awful to be so exhausted you can barely see straight and then be berated because the towel you got isnt soft enough. From her perspective, shes a person who needs to be in control and is now dependent on other people for everything. Shes in a lot of pain and is trying to make herself more comfortable in whatever way she can. I understand that the pain/meds/anxiety are affecting her behaviour. I also dont react well to confrontation with her; I bottle up the little frustrations and blow up over something seemingly inconsequential. Today started off terribly. She was already in a bad mood, very rude and snappy. Our dad came to ask me something and I said her instead of Sarah. She lost it. Said it was demeaning for us to talk like she wasnt there, I told her it was hard to monitor my language that thoroughly when Im this tired. It went on and on. I ended up in tears asking her to just be a bit nicer while she yelled at me that I was telling her she wasnt allowed to feel. Afterwards, she sent a text to our family chat saying she didnt want to be a burden anymore and to find her a rehabilitation centre she could recover in. As a result, Sarah and I had a 2-hour fight where said I needed her to be a bit more flexible with us in terms of when exactly we could do things. If that made her stressed, impeding her recovery, then I could help her find a home. She responded that being flexible is impossible and my request was unacceptable. So, AITA? On one hand, I feel like the text was some truly fucked up emotional blackmail in response to a pretty minor request to be nicer. On the other hand, Im worried my exhaustion and tendency to bottle things up led to a confrontation that couldve been avoided and my sister is in a difficult position with zero control and reacting poorly.",17,25,2020-07-11 21:28:21

I still have to work on these weekends unless it's my rotating weekend off.Last night I worked a little later than my normal shift. We watched some TV and it was time for him to go to bed. My job is stressful and it takes me awhile to unwind. I wasn't ready when he was, so I went into the living room to watch TV.When he woke up this morning, he complained he didn't fall asleep until I came to bed about an hour/hour and a half later. I told him that he needs to find a solution that isn't me lying there and flopping around endlessly because that would keep him awake, too.I was telling a friend about it, and she said I should've just laid there until he fell asleep and then left. I sacrifice a lot when it comes to sleep when he is home because he's home so little (he prefers sleeping in the nude, I do not. He prefers no lights, I don't like the dark.)

234,NTA,AITA for letting my grandpa eat his favorite food?,"Throwaway as I don't need my main account spammed like my other social media...First some background which is neccessary. I (27F) have gotten into a signifcant amount of debt because of my ex (details are not important). It was my own naivity and stupidity and I never said otherwise. I am currently working two jobs to pay the debt. I have never asked anyone to help me with my financial situation and I don't complain about it. My mistake - my problem.I have a grandpa (88) who is one of the most cheerful people I known. I've learned a lot from him and his positive outlook on life. As he got older he started getting diagnosed with various conditions that limit him in his life, one of these is that he can't eat spicy food.About two months ago he was diagnosed with cancer on top of his other issues. For him it's the same as a death sentence, either the cancer kills him or the treatment. He was pretty chill about it, always saying he's lived a good life and has no regrets.Two weeks ago it was his birthday and since lockdown has been lifted where I live, my family organized a party at his house. I thought we'd stay the whole weekend, as it's going to be the last birthday party my grandpa will have, but it was just my family cooking a huge lunch, we ate and they all left by 5pm.I stayed because I had taken a whole weekend off to spend time with granpda and I had to wait for a train home anyway. Grandpa didn't seem suprised. He's asked me if I have time and I said yes. He then said that he has bought his favorite cheese (chilli flavoured) and would like to eat it for his last birthday.I asked him if he is aware that eating the cheese might actually kill him and he said he is, that's why he would like for me to be there so that I can call an ambulance and in case he died he doesn't die alone. I didn't feel very comfortable with it but I just could bring myself to refuse so I agreed to stay.He's excitingly got into the kitchen and made himself his most favorite sandwich with the chilli cheese. We then sat down and I watched him eat it savoring every bite and grinning from ear to ear. Afterwards he went into cardiac arrest (or something similar) so I called an ambulance and rode with him to the hospital. He's been in a coma since and most likely won't wake up.My family arrived shortly after and I told them what happened. I thought they'd be understanding but they just berated me for letting grandpa eat the cheese. I eventually went home only to find out they are spreading on social media that I killed grandpa to get inheritance and they're going to sue me.Fortunatelly grandpa took precautions with his lawyer so I can't be charged with murder, but I lost one of my jobs based on these accusations. My friends lend me some money until I can find another job but I am just mad at my family for spreading lies. It was grandpa's decision to do this and I don't think honoring a dying man's wish to not die alone makes me a murderer.Or does it?Edit: I wasn't going to respond to this, but since a few people called me a troll I thought I should. I have changed the details in the story so that my family cannot google the real scenario. The point stays that he ate his favorite food and landed in hospital in a coma. Also I'd like to thank all for kind words and to the person who said the family is after inheritance, definitely. One aunt texted me that she's ""going to snitch the money from me"". Grandpa is well off and from what I know he has a will in place. However I don't believe anyone can touch my part of inheritance legally unless I was indeed convicted as his murderer.

This winter I didnt see anybody using the path but now its summer and sometimes kids from the neighbor will come up around the side to assess the park... I think the last owners were fine with it and as they havent been a nuisance it hasnt bothered me.  I dont have AC though and have taken to walking around my house naked when it gets hot. Well sure enough yesterday one of the moms in the neighborhood comes pounding on my door (I was clothed) and telling me Im an asshole for walking around naked in front of young kids... I guess a few saw me at home one day.  I kindly explained that I have a right to dress or undress how I please in my home but the mom said she would go to the cops if I didnt stop... and press charges for being inappropriate with her kids.  I got freaked out by this and as such had a contractor come out yesterday to build a fence along the side of my home so it would be inaccessible to the kids.  Now all of my neighbors are pissed at me bc they wont have access to the path and park anymore and will have to walk around to the official entrance.

I thought it would be great but it has sucked. She has really bad insomnia, so getting to sleep and staying asleep.  She's been to doctors,  and sleep tests,  and has tried medication but she says the best solution she's found is sleeping for 4 hours, waking up for a few hours,  then back to sleep for another few hours. I thought I could deal with that but it was more.  She hates sleeping next to people,  which I didn't know until I moved in.  She's says she's scared if waking people up and being woken up by people.  I can see that because I have snapped at her a few times when she's woken me up. This means she doesn't want to cuddle at night in bed.  Its ok on the couch,  but not in bed.  The whole point of sleeping with your girlfriend is to cuddle,  but she hates it.  When I do convince her to do it,  she's on her phone all night. She doesn't even try to sleep. The past two weeks she's taken to sleeping on the couch instead of in bed and it's driven this huge wedge between us.  I'm angry because she's given up even trying and it feels like she resents me.  This all blew over when she commented her back has been hurting from sleeping on the couch and she wanted to get a hotel room for the night so she could sleep.  It was heavily implied I would not be welcome and would be staying in her apartment.  I lost it. It is completely a waste of money and a health risk right now.  If she just tried sleeping in bed with me instead of the couch she'd be fine.  She could take some sleeping meds and be fine,  I know she's taken them before to sleep. She left to go on a 'drive' to clear her head and I'm not sure if she's coming back tonight.  Now I'm starting to feel like I was an asshole for yelling at her,  but I have a point.  Not sleeping next to me feels like she doesn't even want me.

296,YTA,"AITA for treating my children ""differently""?","My wife died a few years ago, leaving me to fend for my daughter and son, who are twins, and it was hard, but now we are stable financially, and this has caused my son and daughter to be eachothers best friends I guess. I wasn't there for them when they were younger, since I had to put a few jobs in, but now we are better so I have been trying to get to know them better.They (17 F & 17M)  both have the same friend group, same school, same extra activities, and hang out together too.That being said, they tell eachother eveything. If I had to find out something about one of them, I just have to ask the other.It's creepy sometimes.Anyway, recently I've taken my son fishing, even signed him up for soccer etc. Not my daughter, I thought she wouldn't want to go. But my she asked why I'm not taking her and I told her that I have just been wanting to make up for some lost time with my son. She said then I should take her too, and that if he gets to have soccer why can't she do some archery or something. I said I knew she wouldn't like it, so I didn't bother to ask. Anyway she let it go and let me and my son go spend some time together.Then a few days ago we hung out again and my daughter confided when I came back and she wants to learn fencing after the whole pandemic. She used the argument that fencing has many good benefits and it's totally safe. I told her that it's going to be a waste of time, and that there's no point in doing it and to concentrate on her swimming. We have a pool.Note- The twins both do swimming and skating, but my son has been doing soccer. Social distancing of course and only in a small course. Since they can't go swimming outside, they've taken to practicing in the pool.She kept arguing saying that if her brother gets to do soccer why can't she do somehting of her liking. Again it turned into a fight and she accused me of liking my son better. I love them both, but she won't like doing the things me and my son do. I told her she isn't entitled to learn any of this. Again she told me that I'm being bias here and my son found out and they were both mad at me, but then I agreed to do it, because my son did put in a fine argument for his sister.AND THEN:My daughter wasn't happy and told me that I only did it to please her brother. It's not my fault my son can put up a nice argument, and she told me that her brother used the same argument as her and ""I'm bias and sexist and should have gave her away to someone else because it's obvious I have a dream kid already."" Maybe my son did say the same things she said but it's easier to agree when it's not a big fight. They are both good academicly, physically , and socially, and I think she's being a little overboard because I have nothing to complain about besides my daughters attitude here.They're both still mad at me.Aita?",429,191,2020-07-10 20:36:19
721,NTA,AITA for telling my boss she was being inappropriate toward me?,"I (22F) have been working in a pharmacy for the last 3 years as a part time job to put myself through university. The main manager went on maternity leave last summer and is due back in January. Her replacement was another one of our pharmacists. Shes from Eastern Europe, and is very much brutally honest and by the book. Im studying to be a teacher, and have just accepted a permanent teaching position in a rural community starting in September. I am beyond excited to start my career that Ive been dreaming of starting for the last 17 years, and finally put my months notice in today. The thing is, my boss hasnt been doing a good job of keeping her distaste for my departure to herself. She congratulated me about getting the position last week. I was surprised about that because when the pandemic hit and she needed full timers, she told me that she wished I would drop out of school or flunk out so I could stay at the pharmacy full time because my class hours wouldnt allow me to work 13 hours a day. I thought it was a joke and carried on. When I announced my months notice to my coworkers, she told me not to burn bridges with the place in case I need to go back. I asked why, and she told me that my career may not work out. I asked her what she meant by that and she told me that its no secret that she doesnt want me to leave, and that there was no way I could be replaced, so the only way I could potentially stick around is if I hopefully leave teaching. I was gobsmacked. I told her that what she was saying was very inappropriate and hurtful. I told her that while I appreciated the compliments toward my skill, this is not where I want to spend my life. I told her that teaching is my dream job and I am doing whatever it takes for it to work out. She then told me that since Ive announced my notice, she wont dismiss me, but Ive ruined my chances of ever coming back if I needed to. My parents and boyfriend think Im in the right for saying what I said, but some of my coworkers have told me that thats no way to thank someone for the skills they have given me. Reddit, AITA?Edit: If anyones wondering about my chances of using her as a reference later, the school district Im employed with only takes university professors and other teachers as references.Edit 2: I think I should clarify that this isnt the only little thing this pharmacist has done to keep me around. She has asked me to leave my teaching internship because the pharmacy should be more important. She also told the original manager not to teach me anything but cashier because she liked how I did things, when she knew I wanted to learn how to do other things in the pharmacy. When I was finally moved up by the first replacement manager to packaging prescriptions, I was beyond excited and I learned very quickly. As soon as the current manager took over, I was put back on cash because I should only do what I know Im good at. She has a history of keeping me from moving forward in my job and using compliments as her reasoning. It doesnt make me feel good, it makes me feel incompetent and that i would do a bad job anywhere but as a cashier. Ive stayed quiet for a long two and a half years, but I couldnt stay silent anymore when she chose to backhand my dream job. Edit 3: Also, burning bridges is not the same as resigning. I fully planned on working to the best of my ability until I left. I still will. My reputation with customers and my coworkers wont be tarnished by my departure. Only the managers pride because she couldnt convince me to stay in a job I didnt intend on staying in forever.",33,21,2020-07-13 03:56:24
397,ESH,AITA for distancing myself from my close friend due to his girlfriend?,"My friend Damian [25M] and I [25F] met the first day of our freshman year of college and have been great friends ever since. We have a very close-knit, mixed gender friend group and we are all extremely touchy-feely people. We all hug each other hello and goodbye, enjoy platonic cuddling, share beds, etc. Most of the group's S/Os understand this dynamic and doesn't mind but there have been instances where S/Os are uncomfortable and everyone respects their boundaries.Damian started dating Kayla [24F] in December so we had been to a lot of outings and gatherings together before the lockdown started in March. When I first met her, she seemed really nice and friendly and was a great match for Damian, who's super fun and lively. He is one of the most touchy-feely people in our friend group so he's usually hanging off of someone, especially when he's drinking.Kayla seemed okay with this at first, which was confirmed by Damian, but at one party, when Damian fell asleep on my shoulder, she snapped at me and snatched him away. I talked to Damian about it afterwards and he said they had a talk and she said she was just having a bad night and accidentally snapped but ultimately was fine with his touchiness. However, it kept happening. Put my feet in Damien's lap, I got a nasty look. Damian slings his arm around me, a snide comment, etc. It got to the point where if Damian went out with us without her, she'd be blowing up his phone the entire time. All the other girls in our friend group had similar experiences with her. Every time it happened, I'd talk to Damian about it and he said they talked, she apologized, etc. I eventually just backed away from all physical contact except for hugging hello and goodbye from Damian to avoid conflict. Then the lockdown hit, so it wasn't a huge issue.It all came to a head last week when I saw her and Damian for the first time in person since the lockdown. We hugged hello very dramatically since it was the first time we'd been separated for that long of a time. She seemed fine with it at the time but when I got home, I had a very long, VERY nasty text waiting for me from Kayla, essentially telling me to back off and that I'm ""too unattractive for Damian to want to cheat with you so stop trying to tempt him."" I sent a screenshot to Damian and told him that I really hurt by her words and accusations and will no longer being seeing or communicating with either of them until she apologizes for her extremely hurtful words and changes her attitude or Damian starts setting hard boundaries because I'm sick of being caught in the middle. Damian has tried texting and calling me apologizing but Kayla won't budge. I haven't returned any of his calls or texts. My other friends think I'm being too harsh and to just let it go for Damian's sake and Damian has been calling me very upset because he doesn't want to lose our friendship but I'm really hurt. AITA?UPDATE: Kayla, Damian, and I finally spoke over video chat this morning. Kayla apologized for her harsh language and revealed that she had been cheated on in her last relationship, which explains the lashing out and inconsistent boundaries due to not wanting to come off as the new ""crazy"", jealous girlfriend. I apologized for my role in not respecting her boundaries and not making her feel more welcomed into our friend group. Damian apologized for also not setting clear boundaries and for putting me and the other female friends in tough spots as he continued to try to initiate contact when it was clear that we didn't want to start conflicts between them. I do really like Kayla and hope that we can move on from this and form a better friendship. Thanks for all your feedback!",188,82,2020-07-12 23:06:43
971,NTA,AITA for not eating Barbeque food with my family?,"I've never used Reddit before, so forgive any errors!I (15F) am a vegetarian who tries to eat healthily. My parents (in their 50s) and my sister (F13) all enjoy barbeques a great deal. I do not, because vegetarian burgers and sausages generally suck in comparison to real ones. (Some are actually really gross - and I'll eat most things)We've been having a lot of barbeques in quarantine (just the four of us) and at the start I was happily participating and eating with them. As it's gone on, however, I've gotten tired of eating unhealthy food that I don't even like that much just for the sake of it. So, when we had our father's day barbeque, I made myself an omelette and some veggies. I sat outside with them and ate, and pariticpated in the barbeque in everything but the food.We're having a Barbeque again today, and I'm planning on making an omelette again - but all three members of my family think I'm being unreasonable, and that it's ""not a big ask"" for me to eat the barbeque food that I dislike. I feel like I am participating, though, because I'm with them in everything but the type of food - and I'm not forcing them to make me the alternative, I'm making it myself. This seems like a silly, small issue, but having three people making snarky comments about it is getting to me.So, AITA for not eating BBQ food?",16,20,2020-07-11 11:45:56

He eats chicken tenders, pizza, grilled cheese, hamburgers, and penne with tomato sauce. Thats it. My family eats out every Friday and Im so sick of the same three restaurants. Id understand if he were picky because he didnt like any foods, but he refuses to try anything new (even if my parents offer to PAY him). I always have to make at least two dinners to accommodate him because he wont eat what I make. Tonight I really wanted some sushi and teriyaki chicken but my brother threw a fit and started screaming. I said, maybe if you tried new foods this would not be happening.

453,YTA,AITA for saying that my friend's hair isn't her natural color?,"Throwaway as I don't want to be recognized. English isn't my first language so sorry if I make any mistakes.I'm a ginger (my mom's a really ""orange"" ginger and my dad has dark brown hair). When I was a child, my hair was more orange, like my mom's, and I had a lot of freckles. I was bullied in elementary school because of this, so when I hit puberty and my hair started getting darker and I started ""losing"" freckles, I was pretty happy. So I started rocking my light brown-ish hair and felt great.One of my best friends is a natural brunette, but with a red undertone. She is also extremely pale and has freckles on her face, so I always teased her that she looks more ginger than I do. Of course it was all in good fun and none of us minded.A few months ago, she dyed her hair ginger/copper auburn, and it looks really natural. She looks great and suddenly EVERYONE is commenting on her hair. Especially guys, all the time guys comment on her hair, how beautiful it is, etc. She's always had guys to be interested in her but this is just too much. I joked about how if I knew that guys had such a ginger fetish, I wouldn't be so happy that I don't look so ginger anymore.Seeing all the positive attention on her, I decided to dye my hair ginger again, and I actually like it. But over one incident I'm wondering if I'm an asshole:I was out with my friend a few days ago (lockdown has been lifted here) and a guy approached her telling her he liked her hair and asked her if it was a natural color. She smiled and was about to reply, and I said ""no it's not, but I am a natural ginger"". He said nice, talked to her a little and then left.My friend got kinda pissed off that I replied instead of her, and I told her that it's not fair to lie to guys like that, especially since some of us have been bullied for being born like that. She said she never lies about her hair and tells everyone who asks that it's dyed. I genuinely didn't know this.I guess she's not that mad anymore, tho I still feel that she kinda distanced herself from me. I don't think I'm the AH as I genuinely didn't know, and also it's not fair that me being born ginger resulted in me being bullied and hating my hair/freckles, and she gets all the positive attention and it's not even her real hair.Edited the first paragraph, accidentally wrote that I have brown hair still.",126,67,2020-07-09 16:32:42

Her boyfriend left her over cheating rumours which I wouldn't doubt for a second. My husband and I don't share the same views and she's his little girl which is fair enough but I feel like she's too out there. She was only single for 2 weeks before hanging out with a new guy and I spoke to my husband about this and he told me to stay out of it and not say anything. I got angry at this as I liked her ex and I said she's became a slut ever since she turned 18. My husband is pissed I said this. AITA or is he overreacting,1962,836,2020-07-09 14:12:22
82,NTA,AITA for refusing to babysit unless paid full price?,"I (19F) have extensive experience with kids (worked at a preschool for three years, have babysat for over 300 different families, have Montessori training, fully certified in CPR and first aid, etc). For this reason, I typically charge more than the average college babysitter would. Parents know that when they pay for me, they pay for a higher level of care, so price usually isnt an issue. A few weeks ago, a mother with 4 kids (9F, 6M, 3M, 6 monthF), who was referred by a family friend, asked me to babysit from 8 AM to 10 PM on a Saturday. After corresponding with her for a bit, she told me she could only pay the rate I charge for two kids instead of four. Given that she was a friend of our good friend and I didnt have any other jobs lined up, I said that was fine with the condition that I wouldnt be doing housework. I generally do cook and clean when I babysit, but since she wasnt paying full price, we came to that agreement. I arrived at her house and was immediately taken aback. Everything was a mess, her children were virtually uncontrollable, and shed left a list of things for me to do, many of which involved serious cleaning. She rushed out of the house before I had a chance to talk with her, and left me with two of her children screaming without additional notes. It was a disaster. There was little to no food in the house, her elder two were extremely defiant and bawled when disciplined, the three-year-old wasnt toilet trained, and the baby screamed when put down. I am generally good with clingy kids, defiant kids, and know how to help kids who arent toilet trained, but I have never had to deal with all three at once in such a cluttered house. More than once, I found exposed outlets, scissors and sharp objects left out, and otc medication laying around. Despite having agreed not to clean, it would have been a serious safety hazard to leave the house the way it was. At the end of the night, I made her aware of the difficulties before taking the money, reminding her wed agreed I wouldnt do housework, and saying I was concerned. She responded with the typical Oh, everythings fine, I know were a little hectic, but so is everyone else, blah blah blah. A week later, she asked me to come again, this time from 10 AM to midnight. After doing a little math, I told her I would not be returning to her house to babysit unless she paid me the full price for 4 children, and more if she wanted me to clean. She was clearly very upset, and kept begging me to lower the rate, but I told her it was unfair to have me do that much for what she was paying, and to find another sitter if she couldnt pay. She then resorted to harassing me on social media and writing a scathing review on my babysitting page. A number of her friends joined in, saying Im an AH whos only in it for the money. A few people pointed out that Ive given larger discounts to good friends in the past. Was it too much to ask that she pay full price? AITA?",4369,435,2020-07-12 17:48:50
752,YTA,AITA for not watching fireworks with my wife?,"So, on 4th of July every year our city does a fireworks show. They do it pretty close from where we live so we go outside and watch it from our backyard. We have done that for the last couple of years. Normally I do not care for it but I watch it because my wife likes it. This year, I was watching Doom Patrol final episode from season one and my wife tells me that they were starting the fireworks and I tell her ""ok, give me a sec, I'll go outside in a few seconds"". Fifteen minutes later she comes inside pissed cause I kept watching the show and forgot to go outside. I apologized and told her I didn't mean to forget about her.That was 10 days ago and she is still giving me silent treatment and treating me like crap. She got even more pissed at me because I told her that she was mad at me for something insignificant. AITA here?Update: Ok. IATA, I get it. Just sat with her and talked about it . She told me she feels a lot better when you talk about stuff. Too bad it took me 10 days and a post on reddit to notice. Thanks for the responses.

692,YTA,AITA for not wanting to pay for something Im not getting?,"So heres what happened: I went through Tim Hortons drive thru yesterday after working 8 hrs in a very hot and humid place. I wanted basically a Mocha ice capp but a few years ago they added whipped topping to the mocha ice Capp so I order it as an ice capp with a chocolate shot. Ive been doing this for years. Anyways, when I ordered yesterday they rang it in as a mocha ice Capp, which costs more and removed the whipped topping but still charged me $4. I stated I did not want the whipped topping nor do I want to pay the price for it to be on there and not get it. The cashier stated its their policy to put ring it in as a mocha ice Capp and charge that price. All in all its only 55 cents more but I dont see why I should pay the price of something when Im having the item that increases the price not added to it... I ended up telling them to forget the order then. Am I an asshole for not wanting to pay the extra 55 cents for something Im not getting on it anyways??Edited for spellingEdit: I spoke with 3 different Tim Hortons Managers (from 3 different stores) and it turns out its not policy at all. Its the franchise owner thats telling the employees to charge it that instead which isnt allowed. So no I am going to be an asshole and contact corporate.",32,32,2020-07-13 00:32:10
532,NTA,"AITA for returning the deposit to the ""wrong"" person?","I am a landlord. I rented out a bedroom to a couple, Jeff and Diane, last year. Their deposit was set at $250/person, so their total deposit was $500. Jeff paid me in cash, and I gave him a receipt. They signed a lease under both of their names and moved in.During their time at the property, COVID struck and they got behind in their rent payments. At the time, they owed me about $1000 in past due rent.After COVID, they broke up and she decided to move out but he wanted to remain at the property. I signed a new lease agreement with Jeff and Diane moved out. In the lease agreement, I specified that Jeff's security deposit and back rent would move over to his new lease. Jeff said he would get half of the back rent money owed from Diane to pay me off. I stated that the old balance due would carry over to the new lease, and whatever Diane and Jeff decided to do to pay me off between them, I didn't care. I just wanted to be paid eventually once the moratoriums end.I e-mailed Diane about her security deposit on June 28, asking her where it should be sent. Diane moved out on July 1.Rent was due by the 6th. Jeff and I conversed on the 6th and Jeff stated that the entire security deposit was his, so the other $250 should be sent back to him.I thought about it and I didn't see any harm in this. I was returning the security deposit to a person that was on the lease agreement. How they decided to pay the security deposit, how could I know what their arrangements were between them? They paid in cash and they paid their rent under one account per month (not two accounts - one for each person). Plus, Diane hadn't gotten back to me since June 28 and it was already July 6 (10 days). I didn't figure that she would ever get back in touch with me.I returned the security deposit to Jeff by deducting it against rent owed (so now they owe $750).Diane finally got in contact with me on July 9 and stated I could send her a check to the leased property address and she would pick it up. I stated that I already returned the money to Jeff, who was someone on the lease agreement, and that if she wanted her money she needs to talk with Jeff.Diane is pissed that I gave away her security deposit. I tried explaining to her that I returned the security deposit to someone on the lease which is all that was required of me. She states that it's $250/person and that she contributed $250. She should get $250 back. Jeff states this is factually incorrect because he paid all of that with his own funds. Diane states all funds were shared between them so it came from both of them. She should get $250.I stated that I deducted it against rent owed which both of them owed anyway. What's the difference? How they want to handle it, they can handle it between them.AITA for returning the security deposit to the ""wrong"" person?In the future, I'll definitely have it specified who gets what security deposit in the lease agreement. I never imagined that it would turn out like this. I think I could have done this better by communicating with Diane directly instead of waiting for her to respond.&#x200B;EDIT: Slight edits for clarity. Original story is unchanged.EDIT EDIT:Diane's complaints are as follows (in her paraphrased words):\- I sent her an email asking about deposit reimbursement but did not wait for her response (it took her 12 days to respond). So I emailed her about money that I really never intended to give back to her.\- It's $250/person in the lease, and she was a person on the lease, so she's entitled to $250. Therefore, I gave away her money. (After looking at the lease, it does not state this. Instead, it states it's $500 for the room. But online advertising says it's $250 for a single occupant and $500 for a couple, so I could see how one could reasonably think this)\- I immediately took Jeff for his word and didn't verify that with her\- Now that I've already given the money to Jeff, I won't take it back from him and give it to her",70,38,2020-07-13 21:24:26
211,YTA,AITA for leaving our daughter alone with my MIL who used to bully my wife?,"If it matters, my wife (38F) and I (34M) have been together for 11 years and married for 7. This was in November but my wife and I still disagree if I was the AH. Im willing to accept I was an AH. Very briefly, my MIL bullied my wife in youth about her weight and as a result shes very self conscious. Its always been my wifes decision how much MIL is in our lives, Ive backed her in every situation. Just to make it clear its her choice to keep MIL in her life, no one is forcing her. MIL lives on the other side of the world so we have limited contact anyway and weve put firm boundaries in place regarding our daughter (then 4) which so far shes respected. We didnt tell MIL about our pregnancy until our daughter was born because we were concerned shed increase this bullying behaviour due to my wifes pregnancy weight gain and may begin it with our daughter. Four years later this has never been an issue with our daughter and MIL has stopped the body shaming remarks towards my wife. Whilst shes never apologised to my wife, she has changed her behaviour and theyve began to have a happier relationship.MIL was visiting for a week (not staying with us overnight) and this day was day 5. It was all going well so far. My wife was working that day where I wasnt so it was us two and daughter at our house. Wed ran out of milk so MIL agreed to watch daughter whilst I nipped to the corner shop. (She couldnt go because she doesnt have car insurance to drive here and it was throwing it down so walking wouldnt have been pleasant.) I was gone for a MAXIMUM of 15 minutes. When I arrived home daughter ran to me in tears. MIL had called her fat (Im a nurse - she isnt) and said some other body shaming comments. I told MIL to leave and after a little protesting she did. According to our daughter this is the first time MIL has made such comments. Its also the first time shes been alone with her, so that certainly wont be happening again. My wife blew up at me when she came home and I told her (daughter now happily playing with our dog). She started yelling at me, how could I leave our girl alone with MIL, we knew shed bully her (I strongly disagree), etc. We ended up arguing for a while (this is rare for the record).Wed both previously agreed to not asking MIL for childcare all day but havent discussed leaving daughter with her for a very short amount of time. I thought it would be fine as I was back so soon, and I accept I was wrong but I dont think I could have seen it coming based on the last 5 years of MILs behaviour and due to this I dont think Im an AH. I apologised to my wife later on and we agreed to disagree but certainly agreed to never leave daughter alone with MIL again and whilst we considered cutting her off, we decided shed just have monitored visits with daughter.  So, AITA or am I right in thinking my wifes overreacting due to past trauma related to MIL?EDIT: Overreactings the wrong word. I was trying more to say is she comparing the damage of years worth of snide comments to one single incident. But I do see how thats not the most sympathetic thing. Im not trying to dismiss her trauma.I would like to say in my defence that my wife had previously expressed to me her belief that MIL was beginning to change - it wasnt solely my perspective.EDIT 2: some of you seem concerned my wife will think Im downplaying her trauma. Ive always been supportive of her and would never disregard her past to her face or to anyone else expect wondering if her judgement is a bit clouded in my own head. Ive only said that here, and my wife hasnt got Reddit.Also, you all seem to think weve literally never left her alone with her. My bad if I gave this impression. We never have intentionally like this, but inevitably weve been in separate rooms for a few moments, used the bathroom, etc - all of which my wife has agreed to. My wife wanted MIL in our daughters life; if she wanted to cut her off I would have agreed. My daughter has repeatedly said this is the first time MIL has treated her like this and shes not one to lie so we think this is true.To address repeated comments: - Im not saying childcare isnt for 15 minutes. Im saying we only discussed it for the full day. - I know youll come at me for saying it but I think it needs to be said again because many of you are stating contrary as your reasoning: my wife did think she was changing and I took that to mean a lot. People dont forgive their abusers lightly. They also dont invite them to visit for a week in a situation where they dont have to. - you dont need to be rude. I accept a lot of you think I did the wrong thing. Obviously I know I did with hindsight.",890,258,2020-07-12 19:54:15
324,NTA,AITA for telling both my parents about my breast pain instead of just my mom?,"So for the last week now I've been having pain in one of my breasts and a few other minor symptoms that could be breast cancer, so I called my doctors office. I got lucky and my doctor was running the ""walk in"" clinic that they're doing over the phone, so I got to talk to her same day. They're not letting anyone come in so I had to describe everything over the phone and she decided to schedule an ultrasound to see if anything's in there. She said something about a mammogram not working because of my age. So after my parents get home from work I call them and let them know everything I just said and we talk about it for a bit. Just basic stuff like I shouldn't tell my sister's until I know what it is and maybe I pulled a muscle swimming, since last time I needed a breast exam it was just a pulled muscle. Then we just talked about how stuff is going in general. After I got off the phone my roommate who I guess overheard it came down stairs to tell me he thought it was gross that I was talking to my dad about that and he didn't need to know unless I actually had breast cancer and that he doesn't keep his mom updated if he has a problem with his dick. I told him it's none of his business and my mom would tell him anyways because she needs someone to talk to when she worried about me. I was tempted to point out that he doesn't keep his mom updated on any of his health because he never goes to the doctor so he wouldn't know if there's a problem, but I didn't say it. He keeps insisting it's borderline incest and I keep telling him he's batshit insane.",341,103,2020-07-12 20:45:49

She said she wanted to have the dog move in with us, and I told her I was fine with it as long as the dog was trained/well behaved. Well, issues arose. Multiple times a week, the dog would be left 12+ hours overnight while she stayed at guys houses after going to drink. (Note: she would also be at work all day before this, let the dog out quick, then go.) The dog would howl and scratch at the kennel all night and day long. Along with this, it wasnt potty trained. At all. I mean multiple occurrences of poop and pee in our house everyday. Along with A LOT of my stuff being ruined. (Furniture, rugs, decor, etc.) I knew I said I was okay with her bringing the dog, so I never asked her to pay me back for any of this. I finally sat her down and told her I wasnt okay with the situation. 1. Her being gone all the time wasnt fair to the dog or me. 2. I was tired of my stuff being ruined and living with dog pee/poop.We talked about it, and she said she understood where I was coming from. It continued. Once COVID came along, I decided to move home for the remainder of our lease. I went back the week before our lease was over to move out my last few things, and there was poop all over the floor, along with damaged carpet, pee stains, and the whole place reeked. Way worse than when I left. I dont have a dog and didnt want to be charged for it, so I stopped into the leasing office to loop them in on everything. They said they would asses it upon move out and go from there.Not only was our $600 deposit each taken out, but an additional $3k bill. The bill was itemized, and my portion of the deposit covered more than the typical cleaning things. Paint touch ups, additional clean in the oven, etc. The remainder of these items were lined out as dog damage. (Dog hair, dog poop on carpet, pee stains, ripped carpet, etc.)I told her that I didnt think it was fair for me to pay that, as I wasnt the one with the dog. She ended up paying the bill, but told me I was a toxic friend for doing that to her, talked mad crap about me to all our friends, and blocked me on everything. AITA?",47,25,2020-07-12 02:00:54

I try to be respectful of people though and will take measures so they aren't subjected to my stuff but she just blocked me rather than his message me and say that I was making her uncomfortable. Whatever. It didn't really bother me since I didn't want to see her stuff either.The part that bothers me is that she has also blocked my mom and Dad for political differences,  well she heard via family that Dad was hospitalized so she unblocked me and started messaging me to ask about my dad. The first couple times I told her and encouraged her to message him directly as being stuck in the hospital he is bored and lonely. She messaged me again today and I again told her his status and then told her I was uncomfortable being the go between.She said she didn't understand.

I don't have a problem with that; I'm glad he found someone. The new wife doesn't mind that I call her by her name, but the rest of her family is mad as he'll that I won't call her ""mom"".The logical side of my brain is wondering, is my step dad's new wife my mom?The emotional side says, I'm in my mid40s. I don't need a ""new"" mom. Sugar momma, maybe  but I'm a grown adult, I don't need a parental figure anymore.So aita for not calling my step dad's new wife ""mom""?Edit: I didn't want to go into this because, even in my books, it's kinda weird, but....My grandpa and my dad's wife's mom grew up together. We were always told that basically, these were ""family""; no blood relation, but they were aunts. The wife's kids have been ""cousins"" my whole life.When my dad married her, I made several jokes about it being some Alabama style family tree; my dad laughed, but it bothered her, so I stopped. I stopped calling her ""aunt"" and just used her first name, and she's fine with that.Her kids are upset that I don't call her ""mom"" or introduce them as my brothers and sisters.",1182,103,2020-07-10 16:05:29
808,YTA,AITA for refusing to give my sister her share of inheritance after she insulted my grandmother?,"Me and my sister (21F and 24F) lost our parents when I was 2. We were raised by our grandparents. Grandfather died when I was 12. I don't even remember my parents. Things were fine until my sister came out as a bisexual few years ago. We have had a lot of encounter with LQBTQ people in my lifetime and I have never seen Grandma act anything less than supportive. I guess it's the typical ""I don't mind gay people as long as they aren't in my family"" kind of homophobic. Things went downhill fast between them. My sister had a serious gf and my grandma kept trying to get my sister to date a guy because ""it's not like you don't have a choice like a lesbian. You can choose a guy, can't you?""  Me and my sister tried to get her to understand, but she just wasn't understanding. A year ago, my grandma's health started deteriorating. She passed away a few months ago. She saved up a lot of money for me and my sister. From what she worked, grandpa's life insurance, she sold the farm as she couldn't take care of it when she got old. Few days after she died, me and my sister found out that grandma left me like 90 percent and her 10 percent. I told her that I will give her equal share despite what the will said. At the funeral, my sister made a big stink. She got drunk and she got up on the stage and gave a long speech about how awful my grandmother was for not accepting her and how selfish she was etc etc. She even said that she was such a bad person and that no one should cry for the loss of such a horrible person. I was so hurt that I couldn't even give the eulogy I had prepared. Was she homophobic? Yes. Was it wrong? Yes. But she also raised us both lovingly until 2 years ago. I am not saying she was right or defending her. Her homophobia was disgusting and me/my sister would get into lot of fights with her over it. But she raised us. Minus the last few years, she has been loving, kind and supportive. Instead of celebrating her life, my sister decided to tarnish my grandma's funeral. Even though there was a part of her I didn't like, it doesn't mean everything was unlikable about her. I refused to talk to my sister after that. Few weeks ago, she called me asking me about the inheritance (Edit: she got 10 percent. She was calling about the remaining 40 percent). I pretty much told her that since grandma was such a bad person, she shouldn't dirty her hands with money that was earned/saved by her. My sister got pissed off and she told me that I am just trying to steal her money. And that I am liar because I promised and I am going back on word. I just hung up on her.

674,YTA,Aita for not wanting a second child?,"Me (35m) and my gf(30f) just had our first child three months ago and are very happy. From the last trimester of her pregnancy, shes said that she wouldnt want to have a second child if the subject came up in conversation with eachother or family and friends. She would say: if you get me pregnant again, imma kill you.  I ultimately agreed. One was enough for me and her. (At the time of conversation). As time went on, she has hinted that she would in fact like a second one if she were to get pregnant, and i still stood firm  with no more children. I told her i would get a vasectomy, but in a joking manner. To be truthful, we never really had that serious convo, but we did convey to each other of our stance. So anyway, about a month ago we have been having unprotected sex (i know ). And shes been mentioning how she may be cramping like shes pregnant. Now, there are a few factors going on as far as her not yet getting her period because of her just giving birth the months ago, the timing and stuff like that. So yesterday, she said she would go get a pregnancy test and i agreed. I told her we need to actually talk about what if shes pregnant. I told her we cant have two kids back to back like this. Its financially irresponsible imo. And her rebuttal is: we will be ok. Thats not a good enough answer for me lol. Now let me give her some slack, shes not deliberately trying get pregnant or trap me or anything lie that. Her main point is, if she happens to get pregnant, she will welcome it. Me, on the other hand my goal is to avoid it forever. I already work two jobs to supplement one child. I dont know what else i would have to do with a second one. (Whew!). Anyway, she got mad at me for not wanting a second child. Shes being short with me and acting pissy. Last night,  she took a test and shes negative (thank god). I went to sleep and went to work and havent had a chance to speak to her about it yet. Our whole relationship has had few bumps and we get along great. We love our new baby and love being parents. We just are at slight odds on this situation. So, AITA?Edit: And to the ppl condemning me, i understand your point for having unprotected Sex andi do take responsibility.  I did tell her Im getting a vasectomy.  But for now on, i will introduce condoms until my surgery. I know she will take offense.",35,32,2020-07-11 14:25:35
733,NTA,WIBTA if I tell my dad my mum plans to sell his house ?,"My mum and dad have been split for as long as I can remember, still married due to not wanting to pay for a divorce but split up. When my grandma died my mum and us moved out of our home to live in my grans house with my aunt. My dad since moved into my mums house. The house is in her name and he gives her the money for bills so she can pay it off. My dads never been well with money. Hes struggling a lot so he got friends to live with him and help pay said bills. This has been going on for years now and its worked. Recently my sister (23) moved in with him and doesnt have to pay recently and she told me about my mums plans to turn the house into a sort of apartment home for my sister, me and my sisters friends to live in. She plans to kick my dad out. Ive never seen my mum happy in a long time and this idea makes her happy because she gets to give her kids a home and she gets a bit of extra money on the side to help herself live a peaceful life. I asked my sister if my dad knew about this and she said No well tell him soon though. Idk how I feel about this. My dad has plans to change some of the house and my mum and sister know this and want him to go through with it. He is spending his own money on this and nvm that but idk if hed be able to afford another place (he probs will idk) and one of his roommates is moving out and a new one is moving in soon. By the sound of things my mum and sister plan to have this done soon and still havent told my dad or my dads gf. My dad was telling me about his plans for the house and he seems genuinely excited and it kills me to know what my mum and sister plan to do.On the one hand, my mums been a victim of abuse recently and Ive never seen her genuinely happy or excited about something and this is a thing shes wanted for years now. But on the other hand my dad is poor, he doesnt know about these plans and he plans to make renovations for a house hell be kicked out off. I know if I tell my mum its awful to do this shed just say its my house not his, he knows Ive wanted this for years but he doesnt know youre doing it right now. He deserves to know at least a few months in advance to give him time to find a new home. Sorry if this was long.TLDR; my mum plans to kick my dad out of his (technically her old) house to give it to my sister and her friends and she wont tell him this.Update: Im going to tell my mum that my dad deserves to know whats going on. Shes mentioned him planning to move to Spain with his gf and how hed be fine but honestly I know that wont happen. My dad and his gf are in a very toxic relationship that wont last much longer and if it does I wouldnt let him leave with her because shes honestly horrible to him. Im going to give my mum a chance to tell my dad herself to avoid my dad seeing her as a horrible person. I hope it works out but idk.",28,25,2020-07-13 09:29:16
819,YTA,AITA for letting my friend burn?,"So this happened in January but I keep getting shit for it and I need some judgement. Apologies in advance for editing, on mobile. So me (26f) and 3 friends (Kyle 28m, John 30m and Emma 28f) went on holiday to somewhere considerably hotter than our home country. Being Scottish, sun cream is fairly vital. Emma and I went out to the beach before the guys and slathered ourselves up before tanning and swimming. We headed into the water as the guys came down so they could mind our stuff but after 5 minutes Kyle waves at us to come in. I came back up and asked what he wanted. He said John refused to help put sun cream on his back because touching another guy would be gay. The thought process behind that is just too bizarre as none of us are gay, and why on earth would that even remotely matter anyway?! I was pissed - both for getting me out the water and for being a homophobic moron! I ended up getting into a slightly heated conversation with John because wtf right?! I helped Kyle out with his back and John then asked if I could do his. I thought this was bold considering Id just been pretty nippy with him. I asked him if Kyle could do his back and he said no. Again just totally fucked up mentality! So I said ok, but instead of using the sun cream I grabbed aloe lotion (no sunblock at all). John ended up lying out for a long time and the next day he had fairly bad burns all over his back. He was pretty laid up for the rest of the trip and spent a lot of time inside or in a tshirt. Kyle thought it was hilarious, obviously John thinks Im a total asshole and Emma is slightly leaning towards me being an asshole. So AITA?",22,25,2020-07-09 23:28:43

Every time she has conflict with my wife she makes it about her size. My wife had a birthday dinner recently and didn't invite my son or his fiance because she can't relax with her around. I guess the fiance saw pictures on social media and wanted to know why she wasn't invited.Against she started saying that my wife judges her because of her weight. My wife has said I hate you because you're trashy and ignorant, because you've torn the family apart, because you don't respect boundaries, but she ignores all of these valid reasons.

490,NAH,AITA for being upset that my husband did not pull over in dangerous driving conditions?,"We were driving on a road trip, and we saw ominous clouds (not quiet green but not a typical cloud) and even our dog was scared. We suddenly hit extremely high winds (60MPH according to local weather reports), terrestrial horizontal rain, and extremely low visibility. Absolutely everyone, except us and 1 trucker pulled over. I begged him to pull over because I did not feel safe. He refused. He insisted that he had control and that he was absolutely right. We did make it out safely but I strongly believe it was a risky dangerous move that put our entire family in danger. After we reached safety, I was so upset that I had a panic attack. I feel that he disregard my feelings and intuition. I feel he put my life at risk when I begged him not to. I don't feel like I can trust him with my life anymore. I feel like he disrespected me. He believes he did absolutely nothing wrong and refuses to apologize. He feels like he was right because he slowed down to 30MPH and he could see the line for the lane immediately in front of him (but not more than a few feet because visibility was that bad). He said he had 2 seconds of visibility. He feels like it was safer to continue than pull over with everyone else because someone could hit us. I believe we were lucky to make it out safely, but it was a bad, risky decision. I no longer trust him with my life.Am I the asshole?He believes he is so justified that he asked me to post this here (wording approved by both parties).",90,73,2020-07-12 21:22:08

We promised to include the other in each other's lives but this was mostly coming from him. We spent the weekend together and I honestly thought this was it. He really was going to do his best. Today he texted and said he needed to call me. I was excited thinking he just wanted to tell me something cheesy. After a bit he never replied and I thought he had just fallen asleep. I texted him again after a few hours and he replied with picture of his arm and his first tattoo. I kind of went off and told him that this was the exact reason I didnt want to be with him. I never know when something is happening in this life. He said he was just trying to surprise me but the tattoo has zero significance to me. He brought up my piercings and said I got them without telling him but he still loved them. I wasnt with him at the time or even talking. My family took my side but I cant feel like I over reacted.

Good enough people who I enjoy even though were very different and have different ideologies. They also think that I am very quiet and innocent even though thats not exactly the case. The thing that bothers me is that they keep making comments about your future with our son and making them grand babies. The mom has asked me what birth control I am on, and if Im willing to move away from family with a man. She also has said things along the lines of skip the condom tonight. Bf was previously married very young and has been separated for two years living in a different state from his ex. But his mom has made comments about him and I getting married and says that its been long enough (weve been dating for a little over a year) to know if he wants to marry/have kids with me. My bf doesnt want kids, I do, and Im super young + going to college. Both of us are aware that this is temporary as not having kids in the future is a deal breaker for me, but again were young and are enjoying being with each other for now.

815,YTA,AITA for going back to the night shift against my wife's wishes?,"I (34m) have been working overnights at my job for most of the time that I've been married to my wife (33f.)  We have 5 and 4 year-old girls and a 2-year-old boy. My wife's always disliked me being on night shift but at my work shifts are awarded based on seniority  and I didn't have the seniority to be on day shift until about 7 months ago.Truth be told I wasn't really that excited to go to day shift, but since my wife really wanted me to I agreed to give it a try at least. So I did, but I didn't really like it. I'm a night owl by nature for one thing and hate waking up to an early alarm. Night shift is more laid-back where I work, at least most of the time, and it's the shift most of my coworkers who I consider  my friends work. Bottom line I was just happier on overnights. I also get a shift premium being on nights. It's only 55 cents more an hour but we have three kids and every bit helps.Recently a spot opened back up on nights. I talked to my wife and told her I was going to take it. She wasn't happy about it and said that if I took it I'd be putting my wants ahead of my family's. I don't really see how as it doesn't change the logistics of much with her and the kids. I'm pretty much just swapping the time I'd be sleeping with the time I'm working. The only real disadvantage is that I'm not home to help get the kids to bed on nights that I work, but working 12 hour shifts means that I have a lot of days off. Working nights I'm able to help them up and fed before I go to bed and will be able to get them off to school when that starts. I thinks it's really a wash as far as my family goes.When I pressed her my wife said that her main objection is that she just doesn't like to be alone at night. She also thinks that being on nights screws up my schedule even on my days off. I feel bad about leaving her alone at night knowing she doesn't like it but I'm just way happier on night shift, so I made the unilateral choice to take the opening, but my wife is NOT happy with me. AITA?Tldr: I made the unilateral decision to go back to overnight shift despite my wife telling me that she doesn't like me being gone at night. AITA?",25,31,2020-07-12 02:59:39

We are currently long distance because of the pandemic, so I'm kind of used to us talking through phone - the usual how your day went, venting about customers, me talking about my buddies, my games etc.Idk why but after some time I just wanted to stop talking. Not sure if I just didnt want to talk or because I wanted to go back to my pc to play, but I decided to say goodbye to my gf. She went silent for a few seconds then told me she tought I will at least wait until she gets home.I asked her if she has a long way to go still, because I'm right in front of my house and want to go inside already (I went to take a walk to talk to her) and then she went silent again, told me nevermind & added that she doesnt want to force me to talk for a three more minutes until she gets home if I really don't want to.Am I the asshole for not waiting until she's at her home? I feel like she's mad at me or something.

368,NTA,AITA for not wanting my son in my childfree brother's wedding because he'll be alone with my brother?,"My brother is getting married next summer. He and his fiancee are both child free. Due to him not liking kids he has his boundaries, including babysitting being out of the question. He has never been alone with my son. I am fine with that because I love my brother but he's not the most patient person, and he doesn't really like it when my son, age 6, acts his age.So now my brother's getting married. He wants my son to be ring bearer. His fiancee has a niece who she wants to be the flower girl, and both kids are going to do a reading together at the ceremony. My brother has admitted this isn't their idea, it's coming from her parents who are paying for half the wedding so they're going with it on that basis. There's no other young kids, and they want everyone going down the aisle in pairs, so my son and the niece are in a both or neither situation.My brother asked a few days ago if my son could be ring bearer. I asked what that entailed, and my brother said it's basically just suit shopping and a few rehearsals. I told my brother to let me know when he needed me to bring my son to the suit shop, and he said I couldn't come because this was ""a guy thing"" and it would be weird if I was there (partly due to the ""guy thing"" and partly because one of the groomsmen is my ex). I said I got why he didn't want me there so maybe it would be a good idea for me to take my son shopping separately. He said he wanted to get them all done at once. I then straight up said that I didn't want his first time babysitting to be in public where my son could wander off while my brother was distracted. He said I was overreacting and the rest of the groomsmen would be there, but of his 4 groomsmen I only know one of them (the ex) and I don't think he'd want to watch my son. My brother then said that could be a test run for the rehearsals, as he also expected me to leave my son with him then. I then said that I didn't want my brother's second time supervising my son to involve fire while my brother focused on other stuff (he's meant to carry a candle). I asked if he'd be willing to babysit my son alone between now and the suit shopping just so I know he is capable of watching my son, and he accused me of trying to con him into babysitting for free and treating him like an idiot. I said my issue was the public setting plus my brother not watching him before this and my brother said ""just get him a phone, he'll be fine"". I then said that I really wasn't okay with that so if he won't work with me, then my son won't be in the wedding.It's been 3 days and I've had non stop contact from my brother, his fiancee, my parents, my sister, and even the fiancee's parents, begging me to reconsider because now the fiancee's niece is going to have to miss out and I'm depriving them both of it, and asking why I suddenly don't trust my brother with my son.AITA?",231,102,2020-07-10 22:53:42

Fast forward one day, and spoiler alert; she didnt take it out and theres frozen coke all over the new freezer. My dad gets pissed and starts yelling at us, and my sister has a meltdown saying it isnt her fault. Apparently from her its my fault because I didnt tell her what would happen.

My daughter (23) made a comment about getting life insurance through her job, so I decided to check on our policy. I hadnt in years. Well, when I did I was surprised to see we had never changed our secondary beneficiaries. They were still my husbands nephews. We totally forgot to change them. I thought it was a little funny, my husband did too. Obviously were alive and fine. We called the company, started the process to have it changed.My son thought it was funny, my daughter didnt. She said we were irresponsible and didnt think of them. What if we had died? What if the nephews didnt give it up? I said they would be taken care of. They asked if we had a will and I admitted no. But we have so much family that has agreed verbally over the years to take them. It never seemed necessary. Besides, were alive, our kids are adults. Its all fixed now and we plan to draw a will up.

She asked me what I thought and I told her that I don't believe that porn is an addiction.  I told her that the husband is probably addicted to masturbation and that porn is just a way to meet that need.  She thought I was heartless to say that about someone's addiction.

Im very very sick, and I cant handle bathing myself properly every day, so I went ahead and shaved my head early for practical reasons. I fucking hate it. I look like a racist skinhead, or like a concentration camp victim. I do not look like a cancer patient, I look disgusting. I dont want to see myself in the mirror, but its not like I spend a lot of time looking at the top of my head so I figured it would be okay. Then, suddenly, my brother and my best friend, who both live with me, had my husband shave them bald out of solidarity. I get it, theyre trying to make me feel less like a freak, theyre showing me Im not alone, etc, etc. The problem is, it feels nefarious. I did specifically ask them not to do that. So the fact that they did anyway makes me feel like my suffering is being minimized, like, Im bald too its not that bad. And I have to see their ugly bald heads everywhere I go, reminding me that I, too, have an ugly bald head. I havent broached the subject with either of them yet, I dont even know if my feelings are justified so I dont want to rock the boat if Im just being a dick because Im sick and grouchy. I just dont want to be reminded of being bald and having cancer every time I look around, its driving me fucking crazy. I dont want to talk to or see either of them. AITA here?Edit: you guys are right, both groups are justified. My brother and best friend are incredibly caring and Im sure they didnt do it to hurt me. Perhaps my request NOT to wasnt very clear, or as one redditor suggested, maybe they thought I was saying no out of self hatred but that I would still appreciate the solidarity. Either way, theyre trying to be supportive and I should appreciate that, but its okay for me to be upset about the ugly bald reminders.Edit 2: Apparently I have angered the entire bald community. Please stop coming after me, I didnt say that being bald is ugly, I said that MY bald head was ugly. And no matter how beautiful they are, they still remind me that I have an ugly bald head. I am upset that I lost my hair. I didnt choose to be bald, and Im struggling with it. Please stop attacking me because you think I hate bald people, because I assure you, I only hate myself.",2267,158,2020-07-11 01:03:31

She isn't super rude but she is definitely cold and makes little comments about how she failed as a mother, because her son broke away from organized religion. For example I said something about wanting a tattoo to honor a cause that is very dear to me and she muttered something about this country.Last night she was getting ready to go to dinner with her husband. She was wearing a dress, I don't really know how to describe it but it was lace and then faded to being backless, so you could see the sides of her breast a little. Probably a weird description but I've wondered about her clothing choices before for someone who claims to be so religious. I'm not shaming her at all though. She's beautiful and totally has the body for it. I asked her as politely as I could why she feels comfortable showing her breasts when she is so religious. She said I'm a bitch and we better be saving for our own place and then left with her husband. He was furious when they came home and told my boyfriend that I have no respect and I'm trashy. My boyfriend thinks it was an asshole question as well.",1146,288,2020-07-13 17:10:26
874,YTA,AITA for asking a girls number right after my parents fired her?,"I am 14M I am in a family of 5 with 2 older siblings. My overall family as in my grandparents aunts uncle and my parents own 3 Chinese restaurants (even though we are Taiwanese but close enough I guess) today my parents let go of the front desk worker(16F) because we needed her to work weekends and she would call out on weekends alot. The let her go as she got into the restaurant and gave her a option to either work the shift and get paid for it or leave and get paid for the shifts she worked on her pay day. She stayed to work the shift. Before she left I asked if I could have her number to stay in contact she said ""your family just fired and I still worked my scheduled shift why would I want to stay in contact with you?"" And she left. I was thinking about it and was a being a asshole by doing that being like hey I know my parents just fired you but wanna hang out some time. I dont know where I'm at on this so I'm asking you.",20,16,2020-07-12 03:03:19
980,YTA,AITA for not apologizing to my boyfriend after a minor car crash?,"This happened a few years ago, but still comes from time to time, so we're curious to see what you guys think. We've long gotten over it, and we're just curious. 100% honest. We're writing this post together.I (27F) got into a minor car crash while my boyfriend (28M) was in the car with me. We were turning right at a stop sign, but my view was obstructed by the cars parked on the side of the road and I didn't see the car coming. It scraped my side of the car. The other car was probably going under 30mph. I was going maybe like 5 mph.The damage to both cars was minor, and nobody was hurt.After we and the other party exchanged insurance information, we got back into the car continued on our way to dinner. I noticed my boyfriend was quiet and sulking, and asked him what was wrong. He explained that while it was fortunate that the damage was minor and nobody was hurt, I should have asked if he was okay. He also pointed out that it was my negligence that caused the crash, and that I should have apologized to him. (Aside: he feels that I can be careless while driving, and maintains that the driver of the vehicle is responsible for the safety of the passengers.)I answered that since the collision was on my side and that neither of us were going very fast, that it was self-evident that he wasn't hurt, and that there was no reason for me to ask if he was okay and to apologize (to my boyfriend specifically, because I did apologize and take fault for the crash to the other driver).In addition, I was flustered because it was the first time I have ever been in an accident, and I didn't think at the time to even ask. My boyfriend acknowledges that he could have been more delicate considering the circumstances, but maintains that his core point holds true. To be clear, he did not yell, but he was obviously mad.I still believe I don't need to apologize to him. AITA?Edit: He did ask if I was okay.",15,34,2020-07-10 07:31:46
249,YTA,AITA for forcing my daughter to drop out of high school (for a year)?,"I never thought I would be put in this situation as a parent. My daughter was supposed to go into high school this year as a freshman. It's a private school. They've made their decision. They're doing in school or nothing this year. No online option. Teachers and students not comfortable with this will have their places and jobs held for a school year. My other two kids are elementary age and toddler age, and I just had a baby (last one). My elementary schooler is able to do distance learning, and the toddler is high risk. My elderly mother is also living with us, and we have to help with care for my husband's grandmother. We CANNOT get exposed. I work for the private school (how my daughter is able to go) and will be furloughed without pay for the next year because I can't risk exposure with my family duties. We agonized over what to do about our daughter. It's too late to start her in public school, and just withdrawing is apparently perfectly fine. We could put her in online school, but it's expensive, those credits wouldn't transfer at all, and she would still have to do all 4 years in that school. Her father and I decided that our daughter also needed to just delay. She would have been starting high school at 13 anyway, so even with delaying it a year, she will still graduate at an appropriate age. We unfortunately need everyone to sacrifice. We're going to be raising 4 kids and supporting two seniors on one military salary. I hate that one of those is making my eldest daughter just not have school for a year, but I was planning to make it up to her later with college and social things. She of course doesn't understand that, and has been furious that she's being ""denied an education"" to ""be a maid"" like her great aunt. It's NOT the same situation. This is about the entire family's safety and protecting each other.",626,407,2020-07-11 17:25:24
509,YTA,AITA for telling my boyfriend that my health issues aren't for him to be annoyed about?,"So, I have health issues. A lot of them. And no real diagnosis yet - we're still slogging through tests and results and more tests and colonoscopies and MRIs and gross high contrast fluids and hospital stay after hospital stay. I have a bunch of gastrointestinal issues, lots of allergies and sensitivities, and things are kinda progressing downwards. I can't eat a lot of foods, and I get tired easily. I throw up often, and my boyfriend deals with these things.My sensitivities to synthetic fragrances and cleaning products seem to be difficult for him to deal with. It's gotten to the point where certain products, if used in the house, can literally bring me to my knees and induce migraines and vomiting. I know these issues are hard to deal with. But they come in junction with being with me. I'm not forcing anyone to be with me, and it's completely understandable if someone decides that my health is a deal breaker for them. I am a Sick Person and that's something that I have to grapple with. I do not have time to grapple with my boyfriend acting annoyed with me when these things impact his life. Because for every little way that *his* life is impacted, mine is impacted a thousand times more acutely. In short, I don't have the ability to manage his negative emotions in the moment because I am dealing with negative *physical* consequences. He doesn't act annoyed at the situation, he directs his annoyance towards me.Today, he told me, ""well, yeah I get annoyed because I'm effected, too!""And I told him straight up that my health issues aren't his to be annoyed with and to keep it to himself.",83,53,2020-07-11 23:51:03
119,YTA,AITA for being concerned with my boyfriends obsession with apples?,"So my bf takes the saying an apple a day keeps the doctor away very very serious. He usually has a minimum of 3 apples a day. The first one, he eats in the car on the way to work. He tells me he just throws the apple core out of the window into grass which is a bit douchey for littering IMO but whatever. The second, he usually eats before or after lunch. Then the third is before he brushes his teeth at night. Not gonna lie, I dont think this is healthy. I mean, its bad to have things in excess right? I understand that apples are good for you but this is a tad bit too far, not to mention it can become kind of expensive and takes up a significant amount of space in the fridge. (He wants his apples cold and crispy)So it was my turn to get groceries. The store was a complete clusterfuck and I was stressed trying to social distance and I completely forgot to get the apples as well as some other things too .It was not malicious at all, and I only realized this once we got home and unpacked the food. He starts losing his shit, that hes only got enough apples to last till the end of the day and he needs it for his drive to work tomorrow. I said, you need it? Whats gonna happen if you dont have a morning Apple? He claimed that it just gets his day going, that eating the apple calms his mind down and eases stress. I told him that this makes me a bit concerned and that theres other, healthier ways of coping and offered to find a therapist for him. Well he wasnt happy with that, he visibly got stressed out and just hopped in the car. I suppose he went to the grocery store because he came back with a couple bags of apples but he locked himself in the basement and hasnt come out since. What have I done wrong in this situation? Im just concerned for him.",2704,1292,2020-07-13 08:05:36
957,YTA,AITA for telling my boyfriend he looked bad in his picture?,"My boyfriend and I are having a genuine argument. His feelings are extremely hurt and I personally feel as if it is unjustified, but here goes. He sent me a selfie of himself and asked me if I liked that picture of him. My boyfriend takes the typical 'guy' selfie so it is always a horrible angle, it is never what he actually looks like. He's so un-photogenic that when my friends first asked me what he looked like, I did not show them his pictures because he just does not know how to take a good picture. I honestly told him, no, I didn't like that picture. He seemed taken aback and asked me why. I told him that it is just a really bad picture of him and doesn't even resemble what he looks like. He then got angry and told me that ""as my girlfriend, you should always think I look good"". He thinks that since I love him so much, that love should basically make him look extremely beautiful even in his worst pictures. He was also upset because he thought he looked genuinely handsome in that picture and I made him feel ""ugly.""I'm perplexed. Am I the asshole? I tried explaining to him that he looks bad in the PICTURE, not in REALITY.",17,36,2020-07-15 02:31:47
137,YTA,AITA For not including my adopted brother in my family picture?,"I know this sounds bad but maybe once you read everything you will understand why I did this.2 days ago was my birthday (just turned 17!) and it was honestly the best birthday party I ever had. I invited many people (including my family & adopted brother).When it was picture time, we took a group picture and I later asked if I could have a family picture too (just the family). My family agreed and my mother wanted to call my brother to come as he was talking to his friends. I told her to not bother him and that we can take another picture with him later. We took the picture and after 30 minutes we did another family picture with him included.Today my brother noticed my frame picture and asked me why I didnt use the one where he was in. I told him that I would prefer to have just the family in my frame. He got really upset and I could swear he was on the verge of crying. He told me ""oh ok"" and went to his room. From that moment he is acting cold with me and is avoiding everyone in the house. My mother even asked him why he is acting like this. I told my friends what happened and they called me an asshole for it.I didnt mean to offend him but I just wanted to have a family picture in my room. I was hoping he wouldnt have a problem with it as none of my other friends or anyone else in the party cared.

515,NAH,AITA for not taking my daughter on vacation?,"So this has been the summer from hell. My son is out of work and needed a place to stay with his wife, who really might be my least favorite person ever. My son and my daughter do not get along because my husband is an idiot who thought it was okay to openly favor our daughter. My daughter is seventeen and going through this horrible righteous phase. She is constantly miserable because of things going on in the government and I understand that the government sucks but I can't do anything about it. My DIL announced that she was pregnant the other day and I broke down crying because that is just one more thing to be stressed about.My husband found a beach house we can rent so we can get away from our children, and when he told me it was legitimately the happiest I've been in months. DIL said she was excited for a change of scenery and I laughed (I know, I shouldn't have laughed out loud) and I told them they were not invited. My daughter is upset because she thinks since she is underage (by three months) that we have to bring her. There is plenty of food in the house, a cleaning service, they can order takeout, she will be fine, but she actually cried at dinner and said we're horrible parents for not taking her.",78,85,2020-07-14 20:36:18
656,NAH,WIBTA for making my sisters share a room?,"Backstory: Im (f19) the oldest of five siblings. I live in a household with two parents, two siblings (not including myself), and two cousins. Im nineteen and I moved back home from college this march because of the COVID situation. After I left for college, my two cousins took over my room. I was fine with this as long as Id get to have it over major breaks such as Summer and Winter. When I came back for Winter break I decided to stay in my sister's (13) Sarahs room. It was fine for the time and I didnt mind it. I decided then that I would be fine with sharing with her instead of getting back my own room and she was fine with it too.Fast forward to Spring break I was told that Id have to remove all my belongings from the dorm and come back home. Sarah and I both had to give up things in order to keep everything organized in the room. We share a queen size bed so nothing really feels divided. It wasnt bad in the beginning because I was used to sharing a room in college. As time went on I started craving privacy and along with that, I decided to transfer to a university in my hometown so Id be staying at home until at least graduation (2023). For the past month or so Ive really been wanting my own room. She hasnt done anything to aggravate me or anything I feel like I am just in a completely different part of my life than she is. I work full time (2 pm to 11 pm) almost every day and Im taking college classes. So I am on a totally different schedule than she is. There is a possibility of me getting my own space, my youngest sister, Taylor (8) lives in the study that we have converted into a room for her. Thats been her room since birth and she has at least a thousand toys in there. Shes getting to the age where shes starting to grow out of it. My dad has jokingly offered me her room a few times. I asked my mother in the past if she would be open to us getting bunk beds or two twins so that it feels like some sort of separation but she said no and that if I really wanted it I would have to pay for both by myself. Also to note I cant take back my old room that my cousins currently share. So taking Taylors room is my only reasonable option.Im just worried that my selfishness will cause issues in the family. Sarah absolutely does not want to room with Taylor and Taylor will be devastated that she has to get rid of most of her toys. They really dont get along and it might cause even more issues. I know this will cause both of my sisters to resent me. Right now the living situation is not too bad for me but I know as time progresses Ill start getting more irritated by it. Another thing to note, I plan on moving out sometime next year but I think thats a substantial time away especially now that we're all home. So would I be the asshole for forcing my sisters to share a room against their will just because I feel like I need space, or is my point valid?Edit: I do plan on consulting with my family first I just came here for some opinions",42,30,2020-07-13 07:56:01
893,YTA,AITA for hopping over the counter and pouring my own drink in McDonalds?,"This happened about 5-months ago now. I had to leave it a while to mention, and you will see why soon.The McDonalds I was in was pretty damn busy. I ordered my food, and it had to be cooked. I stood to one side while I waited. It was then given to me without my drink. I asked for my drink and they said ""it is coming""10-minutes I stood. I asked for my drink, the server said ""yeah yeah. It is coming. I have all these customers to deal with first""Now, I don't know about you, but in my mind, dealing with other customers shouldn't be a thing when you have previously served customers WAITING for something as simple as a damn drink.15-minutes, I said ""Can I have my drink yet? My food is getting cold"". The response was ""I told you to WAIT""20-minutes, I said ""give me my fucking drink"" I actually said it in a raised tone, but not shouting.The server took my food away and asked me to leave for being ""rude""I snatched my food back, hopped over the counter and poured my own damn Fanta.I was being recorded on somebody's phone at this point and they said ""we gonna YouTube this shit"". That is why i waited to post. I didn't want to be identified. However, it seems that video was never posted or nobody ever cared about it.I waited 20 minutes for a drink to be poured. 20 minutes with cold food PLUS the additional 10 minutes of waiting for the food to be prepared, to begin with. That is 30-minutes. I felt I was more patient than most would have been. I didn't say anything for the first 10-minutes. I knew they were busy.

261,NAH,AITA for giving my mom a game I knew she might get addicted to?,"My mom (75F) has recently been showing signs of mild cognitive decline. I have felt for some time that part of this is because she doesn't have a lot of social interaction in her life, and she hasn't been using her brain very much. She has been playing this stupid slot machine game all the time. There is nothing to this slot machine game other than staring at the screen and waiting for flashing lights and bells.I recently started playing Animal Crossing New Horizon. I knew when I started playing it that it might appeal to her. I also knew she might get addicted to it. It's an addictive game anyway, and she has a history of addictive behavior, such as having a gambling problem in the past. Even though it doesn't have real social interaction, I hoped that the simulated interaction might help her. The game also does involve more thinking than just staring at the screen.So, I bought my mom a Switch and the game, along with a couple of other puzzle games. Well, she did get addicted to it. She plays it all day and half the night. The thing is, I can definitely see that it is helping her mentally. She's sharper than she has been for a while. She's also started getting involved in the online communities and visiting other islands. The problem? She gets so wrapped up in it that she has basically stopped taking care of my dad (82 M). She has stopped cooking and has let a lot of the cleaning go, as well. He's upset that he's being neglected, and that I gave her the game knowing how she can become easily addicted to things. Some other family members also think its weird I gave her a ""kid"" game. I think it's ridiculous. I would rather her be addicted something like this than a slot machine game. Especially because she kept talking about wanting to go to casinos when she was playing it.ETA. Today I talked to my mom about getting a home health aid. The hospital tried to set one up last year after my dad was admitted with an infection and she refused it. I suggested they work on getting that set up again. I pointed out my dad's health has continued to decline and she shouldn't have to take care of him alone. There's not much Ican do personally, unfortunately. She said they'd talk to his doctor about it.",538,43,2020-07-15 01:42:54

I have a good relationship with my mother of mutual respect and collaboration, ever since my dad left, we've been a team in keeping the house afloat in term of finances and chores, however, with time, my mother has become messier and messier. What bothers me the most is that she leaves empty bottles, cans and egg shells in the kitchen sink. I try to do my part but it's a big house and I work full time, I've talked to her multiple times about making my sister help around the house or hiring someone to clean if she's to tired to do things, but she always answers with ""maybe"" or ""we'll see"". We've been having ants, roaches and I've seen RATS in the kitchen, and I just get depressed and anxious being here, because I just really, REALLY hate living in this condition. So one day I send a picture of egg shells and an empty can in the sink to the group chat (were my mother and the rest of my adult siblings are) with something like: ""this is why have roaches"" to which my siblings answered  with disgusted comments. After a while my mom came a cleaned the kitchen, so every time she leaves trash on the sink, I send a picture and she comes and cleans it. I don't like embarrassing my mother, but I'm tired of telling her that we'll get sick if she keeps leaving shit in the sink! My siblings have told me that I should let it go since I'm moving out soon, but that doesn't change the fact that my mother and my sister will keep living in a shithole if they don't clean more.

452,YTA,AITA for telling my brother to get some gay friends?,"I'm going to be a senior in high school, my younger brother is going to be a freshman. He was asking me for advice in the case schools end up opening in the fall in regards to friends, clubs, grades, girls, etc. I gave him some advice with girls-- make friends with some gay guys, a lot of them are friends with a lot of girls and can set you up. I explained I don't mean approach them entirely with an ulterior motive and use them for girls-- that would be wack-- I mean figuring out who's gay, hitting them up, and seeing who you genuinely vibe with. Nothing nefarious about it, just an opportunity to make new friends who can help you out at some point.My older sister \[19F, going to be a college sophomore\] overheard me and called me out for 'stereotyping' guy guys and using them. As I explained, my advice (which I clearly explained to my brother) wasn't to use them, I just think it's cool to have gay friends and encouraged him to find ones he actually likes. As for stereotyping, I didn't say all, or even most, so it's not some blanket statement. I just said a lot of them have girl friends, which isn't untrue. AITA?",122,91,2020-07-12 23:44:39

My mom is currently looking at a $20k kitchen renovation, for example.Would I be the asshole if I sat them down and asked what their expectations are?

I really connected with her in many levels and one thing that I appreciated was our promise to keep each other in check, look out for each other, and bros before hoes/sisters before misters sort of deal, because in her past relationships, she would entirely ignore me when her bf was around. I thought she changed, until she got into another relationship with my guy friend. She didnt change at all, ignored me constantly, and left me on read.Im not one to confront my problems but, I decided to let her know, and I admit that I was very blunt. I told her my frustration. It was if she entirely forgot what we promised each other. She ended up being really understanding, apologetic for the first time. We hugged it out later, and I felt a lot better.Months after, nothing changed. During quarantine, I didnt talk to anyone for a good week (this problem+personal problems), but still posted on my ig story (ACNH stuff). She ended up blasting me on her snap saying all my friends are fake, which lead me to prove that with my whole week break was a test that she wouldnt ever care to talk to me first unless I did.I decided to message my guy friend/her boyfriend. He always went to me about their problems and advice, and I was always there to help because they fought constantly at the start. Because of it, Id let her know that I was concerned for her relationship because I didnt want her to fall into toxicity again. I asked him how Ellie was and how she was feeling (because of that snap), and proceeded to tell him how I felt about us. He didnt take it well. He called me rude and selfish for messaging him instead of her, and how going through to the boyfriend instead of the person was a dumb move.The day after I messaged him, Ellie sent me text, and to be fair, she was just as blunt. She said that Ive been problematic, Ive been selfish, and have been butting into her relationship. She said I involved myself too much and whenever I told her I was worrying about her relationship, she was annoyed and uncomfortable. She said that of course shes going to care about her boyfriend more, and even thought all of my social media posts during that week was to shove in her face about how well Im doing while she isnt, hence why she ended up never messaging me. Ellie even said that everything she told me during our last talk wasnt 100% sincere, and she only said it to please me.Apparently she reached out to our whole friend group about us, and everyone is on her side, mad at me without ever reaching out about my side of the story.I ended up apologizing because I felt so bad she had a rough week. Weve never told each other our concerns so it was a good learning experience, but I still feel like everything Ive done ended up being twisted. AITA?

Stepdaughter now wants to come stay with us like she normally does every summer. However this time she wants her mom to stay with us too because shes lost her job and has no place to live. My husband thinks it could work but Im 100% against it. For one thing I bought this house before I got married and I dont want my husbands ex sleeping in one of my guest bedrooms. Simple right? Stepdaughter is upset that Ive laid down the law and accused me of trying to keep her and her mom apart. I told her she doesnt have to stay with us this summer, but my rules are final. So now she and her mom are staying with another relative one state over. My husband now wants to stay near them over the next few weeks as a result because he wont see stepdaughter rest of this year otherwise. I told him if hes actually thinking of driving off and living with his ex then he can move out permanently. And Ill be filing for divorce right after.I have some friends/family who thinks Im being too harsh over this. But I dont see why I should be ok with my husbands ex living with us for any period of time. AITA?**Edit:** to clarify, stepdaughter wont leave her mom this year for a bunch of random reasons, nothing comprehensible or legitimate imo. Husband has no custody of her so we cant force her to come live with us, even though living with us by herself is the obvious solution (I know I know). So husband thinks best course of action is to drive to see her. Honestly thats a dealbreaker for me.

Husband was worried people would think I'm a lesbian,Throwaway as I feel this is so ridiculous and don't want it on my main account.I recently ordered some new clothes and one of them is a top with a love heart on it. The love heart is coloured in 7 different colours making a rainbow look. I got it because it looked bright and cheerful. Today I came downstairs wearing it and my husband asked why I'm wearing a rainbow top when I'm not gay. I told him you don't have to be gay to like rainbows but he got annoyed and said he wasn't going out with me in public wearing it as people would think I'm a lesbian. I told him if people think that then I have no problems with it and that I was wearing it whether he liked it or not. In the end he refused to come out shopping with me and has been acting like a toddler who's taken a tantrum since I got home. He made similar comments when I got a pixie cut 3 years ago which I absolutely loved but I've grown it back since as he said he wasn't attracted to me with it. Apart from that he never makes homophobic comments and seems to have no problems with gay people.,2549,374,2020-07-10 20:10:55

The younger one made a token effort to ice a basic cake that she bought from the supermarket but the older two barely said anything to her all day.  Sister had to organise her own party.    Sis has had a prick of a year (cancer scare took her by surprise plus urgent thyroid operation).  My mum (their  gran) my wife and I took the kids aside (at their house) to say that the fact that they made zero effort was poor fucking form and that they really should put their heads together to do something nice for her.  When they back chatted their gran I said in no uncertain terms that it was not time for excuses but time to listen.  Dropped a couple of f-bombs saying that it was a disgrace that they couldn't even be bothered to write a card or do something nice like breakfast in bed etc.  Told them that our disappointment comes from a place of love and high expectations, that they are dear to us but that they need to show more gratitude to their mum (who bends over backwards for them), especially on a milestone birthday and especially after having such a shit year.     Next day their dad takes me, my wife and mum aside and calls my sister lazy (shes messy but definitely not lazy) and says if we ever talk to his kids like that again we're not welcome at his house.  He's the sort of guy who yells at teachers when his kid has been mucking up at school. Got a quadfecta of disrespecting my mum, my wife, and calling my sister lazy and implying that she is not worthy of gratitude from her kids on her birthday.  Frankly I'm fucking furious with this and him trying to act all tough swinging his tiny dick around because we told his kids to make an effort on his wife's birthday.  Only reason I didn't walk out was because mum wants to keep the peace and my kids love playing with his (and vice versa).    AITA?",127,45,2020-07-11 12:27:53
128,YTA,AITA for being angry that my boyfriend is walking his best friend down the aisle?,"So throwaway account.I've recently started dating this guy - Andy for about six months. His best friends are Felicity and Jacob and they've all been friends for over ten years. Andy and Felicity are very close - and I mean very close. They go to one another for everything, they meet up two days of the week and they text 24/7. At first, I tried to not think anything of it as I knew they were friends but I didn't realize they were that close. I've questioned it before - thinking that surely there was something between them prior. He laughed and said that nothing has ever happened between them, that Felicity and Jacob were always a thing. He also said that they went through a lot of things during high school and that she was his person during really rocky periods in his life and they're each other's support systems. I'll be honest, their closeness does make me feel uncomfortable and I feel that it often interrupts our relationship.Fast forward to now, Andy is the best man so he's often busy helping with wedding planning, etc. One night I was invited to drinks and I was then made aware that Andy offered to walk Felicity down the aisle, confused I asked why wasn't her father walking her down. Felicity said that he passed away and that originally her cousin was walking her down but he lived interstate and was unable to travel due to borders being shut.When we got home I asked Andy why didn't he tell me or even ask if I was okay with it. He replied that he didn't have the time to tell me as it was arranged literally moments before we went out to drinks and he asked why wouldn't I have been okay with it. I told him that I was slightly uncomfortable by the closeness of their relationship and I often felt he prioritized their friendship over our relationship. That the last couple of weeks I felt that I wasn't given as much attention as Felicity had been receiving and I didn't really understand why he was the one to be walking her down the aisle. He said that he was very close to her dad and that Felicity is a very important person in his life and she shaped him to be the person he is today and that she's done so much for him that he wanted to do this for her. He said that I shouldn't feel uncomfortable and that he hadn't meant to make me feel that way. He stated that their friendship was important just as much as our relationship. I got angry by this as I felt he wasn't understanding my perspective at all, I said that he clearly thinks I'm of less importance compared to her and that he wasn't taking my feelings into consideration. I told him I was uncomfortable by it and out of respect for me, he should at least just stick to being the best man and perhaps find someone else to do the job. He said that I should be respecting his decision to do this for Felicity and that she doesn't have anyone else to do this for her. I ended up dropping the conversation out of frustration and I don't know if I'm being the ass in this situation.",2368,871,2020-07-10 16:32:18
716,NTA,AITA for being creeped out by my boyfriend for finding out my address without me knowing?,"My boyfriend and I met in uni and he recently moved back to Japan, so we talk mostly through text and calls.For the most part, our relationship for the past 3 months has been without major issues, however, just recently, he did something pretty stalker-ish (finding out my address without me telling him) and the way he did it rose a major red flag and I'm scared this could be a precedent for something much worse to come.The reason why I say this is because in a past relationship, my then-boyfriend who knew my address, would not stop emailing me, calling me, or threatening me to harm himself if I ever decided to break up with him. He even visited my flat and waited outside for me without me knowing. Needless to say, these were all massive red flags and to this day, has made me SUPER uncomfortable with the idea of sharing any sort of personal information with a SO or otherwise (something I will fix in the future, hopefully)But anyway, my current boyfriend being nice as he is, decides to send me a gift which I've been talking about for a while. Except just as I was about to give him my address, I find out he already knew what it was and sends it to me by text. I can tell you without a doubt, I had NEVER given him my address, nor mentioned it, or accidentally uttered it, and if I did, I would've known (as mentioned earlier I'm very cautious about that stuff now) He knew my door number, flat number, and my postcode. I was VERY creeped out by that, and when I asked him he simply responded '' I found out legally don't worry''I press him about the ''legality'' of this, to which he states its a secret. He keeps brushing it off as something unimportant and said that I mentioned it in conversation. Odd right? So then I start thinking maybe it's my fault, maybe I DID accidentally mention it in passing conversation and he just won't tell me. I text a friend about the situation and she stresses that I need to ask him up front instead of doubting myself. So I do and he tells me this:During one of my calls, (2 months ago)  I was asking him to help me pick an outfit for a party, and I was screen sharing on my laptop. My mum came in and asked me to order something quickly for her. So I auto-paid by PayPal and unknowingly, he got his camera out and took a picture of the screen. Fast forward to today, this is the same image he's used to buying me my gift (he sent it to me when he admits it). I only went to order my mum the item for a split second so for him to have the idea of whipping his camera out to take a pic seemed off.After finding this out I ask him why he did this and he says that he simply needed to know my address, and since we're together, he just needed to know it. I made it clear that I found that very weird and concerning because he could've simply asked me. I told him I was creeped out about it basically, and now I'm worried I've made him feel guilty. I feel bad about it.So AITA ?",28,41,2020-07-09 18:55:46
727,YTA,AITA for telling my friend she is not that cute ?,My friend Jessica(23 F)  is  obsessed over a guy whom she met on Tinder and met for only 2 times. Then he didnt want to keep seeing her. She keeps bugging me about him. She wants to talk about him all the time. Question why he doesnt want to see her. Like what she might have been done wrong.The guy just doesnt seem to care. And I think that is pretty normal. Not everyone has to want to keep seeing someone and have a relationship. I told my friend this like couple of times.She always always says but she looks so cute and hot and its his loss if he doesnt want to see her. I say yea thats right or something but a couple minutes later she wants to think about why he doesnt respond again. I got so angry and finally told her maybe she is not as cute a she thinks she is.Omg she completely lost it and acted like a teenager and doesnt want to talk to me. I talked about this to another friend and she says I shouldnt have told that to her. AITA?,29,34,2020-07-09 16:25:27
742,YTA,AITA for putting on a face covering because my mom is eating fish?,"So, I came out of my room and into the dining room to see and smell my mom eating fish. The smell wasnt too bad but it was definitely noticeable (and I really dislike the smell of fish). I initially asked her where was the cinnamon? because she once told me that it kills the smell. She didnt respond so I went back inside my room and got my face covering. I wore it because I wanted to prepare my dinner (which was in the kitchen btw and the kitchen also had the fish smell). Anyway, my mom isnt talking to me anymore, and she usually does this when shes mad. AITA for wearing a face covering because of the smell?This happens sometimes cuz my mom likes to eat fish once in a while.",30,27,2020-07-13 07:46:22
702,NTA,AITA - boyfriend exploded at question,"Hey there,First time posting. I (26f) was talking about our finances with my boyfriend (31m). Hes the only one working right now, Im unable because of covid so Im receiving CERB. We were going over paycheques and bills, when I noticed an extra 1000$ that wasnt being talked about.Backstory: his parents have lent him money recently, he also had an ex claim she was pregnant and then ran off with the child/block contact.When I realized there was extra money not going either towards our bills, our house, or savings, I asked if he was sending money to someone this month. I just assumed he was paying back his parents, or maybe his ex had made contact and needed something for the baby. As soon as I asked he exploded with anger. Screaming at me accusing him of cheating. If it hurt his feelings and he actually thought I was accusing him, Id have appreciated him just telling me that instead of screaming at me. He got so defensive and angry now Im thinking there may be something sketchy going on. He was berating me of not being happy until I get every penny out of him, even though everything I have or make myself is put towards our house to secure a stable future together.Theres been multiple red flags before, is this another one? Or am I the asshole?",117,37,2020-07-16 00:21:23
457,NTA,AITA For not letting my older sister use my P.I.P money to buy her a new Phone?,"This is my first post so here I go ( I do apologize I'm really nervous)  I'm an 15 year old autistic girl I've recently had my P.I.P results and my jealous older sister wants me to use my money to buy her a new phone( To those who don't know what a P.I.P is. It's meansPersonal Independence Payment(PIP) is extra money to help you with everyday life if you've an illness,disabilityor mental health condition. You can get it on top of Employment and Support Allowance or other benefits.) From my p.i.p I get around 600 to 700 ( from what my mother has told me) So let's get to the storySince I was diagnose with autism my older sister ( let's call her Katy) has been really jealous of me, yeah she's since to me ( most of the time) she always got what she wants from makeup to brand new laptops etc. She would break her arms get herself ill just for attention, she has brought me a few things which seems strange to me when tho she hates me.So when I told her that I was accepted with me p.i.p she suddenly started being really nice to me ( and I mean REALLY nice ) and started buying things like Dragon ball z merchandise, new clothes ect. Which I do use some of the money I earn to buy her things back since I love my big sisterThen she send me a message on discord asking me to buy her a new phone since ""I brought you so much, so you owe me it"" so I told her ""sorry Katy mum says that the money is to help me with my future so I can't use it on others it's for me""  then Katy response ""Why do you get all of this money but I don't it's not fair"" then I respond back ""what happened to all the other phones that your dad got you?"" She types back ""those other phones are so useless my dad can't even get me decent phone"" so I replied ""I'm sorry Katy but I'm not going to use my p.i.p money to buy you a phone"" Then she said something that really broken my heart ""oi you little shit, I am the one who got you all of those  Dragon ball DvDs and shit, you are going to buy me the phone as a re-payment, I deserve that money not you, you only have autism it's not that much of a big deal"" I couldn't take it anymore so I blocked her on discord and banned her from my server, she has compiled to my step-brother (Jonathan) that I am a asshole for not getting her the phoneSo people of Reddit am I the asshole?",117,37,2020-07-11 18:09:49

835,ESH,AITA for telling my girlfriend I expect more from her?,"Using my alt cause she uses Reddit. Me and GF have been dating for about 2 years now. I currently work ~13 hours a day 6 days a week. She is unemployed due to COVID. We live in an apartment together in which I pay all of the rent for. We do not have any children together, only a dog. Things have been going smoothly, when this all started, she would have dinner ready, laundry washed, place clean, dog walked, every night when I got home. She has recently stopped doing most of those things. I come home to a messy place, no clean work uniforms, no dinner ready. She says she is not a homemaker, and it is not her job to do those things. I told her spending a couple hours a day doing some basic chores is more than a fair trade for me supporting us. I honestly dont even have time to do chores when I get home, I have a couple hours max of free time when I get home, then I go to sleep. We recently got into a fight about this, and I told her I expect more from her as she literally does nothing all day and has 24/7 free time. She has not even been walking our dog every day, only a few times a week. Shes just being lazy to put it bluntly. Her friends/my family think Im in the wrong here, and everything she does should be seen as a favor and Im blessed to have her in my presence, and she is not my wife. She has used the argument well maybe if you put a ring on it Id be more willing to do chores around here.AITA?EDIT: she is receiving unemployment and not contributing towards rent, only groceries (as I eat 2 of my meals away from home) the rest she spends on herself. She is not looking for work even tho we live in a state that is pretty much fully reopened. We did have some form of an agreement where she would keep the house clean and the dog walked and do our laundry in exchange for me picking up more hours at my job because her unemployment is less than what she was earning. I am not demanding anything. I am telling her that I expect her to hold up her end of the verbal agreement we had. To those saying that I need to do the chores myself, are you saying that the chores should be 50/50 even tho the work is 100/0??",24,65,2020-07-11 00:30:24
794,ESH,AITA for asking my mom not to wear bikinis and revealing outfits when my male friends come over to our house?,"I realize that my friends will always talk about my mom no matter what she does, but it doesn't help when she wears bikinis in front of them or her sports bra and workout shorts. It seems like every time I have friends over she's in an outfit trying to show as much skin as she can. It's gotten to the point where I don't feel like I can have friends over unless I want to hear them talk about how much they want to bang my mom and what they want to do with her and how good this or that is. If she would let me go to their houses, it would not be a problem, but she won't. So either I don't have friends over from now until I go to college or invite them over and listen to them talk about her all the time. I have asked her to tone it done a little when my friends come over and she refused. She said it was her house and she could dress the way she wants. I kept asking and she finally told me not to ask her again because I had no business telling her not to dress a certain way. I get that but I think she is being an asshole here and not me.

256,NAH,AITA for reaching out to the (birth) father of my twin daughters in the wake of my divorce and custody battle with my husband (who is on the birth certificate)?,"It sounds really bad and Jerry springerish, but I can explain. I'm getting divorced after 13 years of marriage. High school sweethearts, young love, infidelity on my STBXH's part - the usual stuff. Our marriage hit a rough patch 7 years ago. He fell in love with his married co-worker. They decided to be together, yada yada. We were separated, like full on divorce papers filed, for about a year. She went back to her husband. Idiot me thought he realized his 'mistakes' and came back home. I started my hysterical bonding as soon as he moved back in with me. A few days later I found out I was pregnant. Obviously, I didn't think much of the drunken party night I had with my buddies. We were all absolutely hammered, and I woke up not remembering much the next day. So the fact that I hooked up with a guy friend from college in the club restroom completely vanished from my memories. So things are normal, I'm pregnant, we are happy. I give birth, we all are happy for 4 years. Then we find out that his co-worker finally did divorce her husband, and the next thing I know, we're getting divorced, AGAIN. Only this time it's permanent she's pregnant with my STBXH's baby. I never really liked her or had much of a choice in the situation. I obviously hated the idea of my kids being around her, but I had to suck it up. He's moving far away (5 hours) to be with her and ALSO pushing for 50/50 custody. I obviously put my foot down, and got labelled as 'controlling' when I suggested them looking for an apartment nearby. So one sunny afternoon at my childhood home, I pulled out my kindergarten yearbook and was going through the pictures, only to notice the distinct similarity between my guy friend's (we were also in kindergarten together) and my daughters' facial features. They had the same distinct ears. I was alarmed, looked him up on facebook, and sent a quick DM, asking about THAT drunken night 5 years ago. He confirmed that we did hook up, and that he didn't want to tell me about it later because I didn't remember anything. At this point, my heart was beating fast and I tell him everything, and send him pictures of my daughters. He calls me up immediately, and goes ""they are my babies and I'm gonna take care of them forever"". He wasn't mad, he apologized for not telling me about our 'hook up' all these years ago. He came down to meet my daughters (as a friend). His mother came along and confirmed that they looked exactly like his childhood self. Paternity tests come by, and he's the father. STBXH initially thought that it was my ploy to get custody and a fake set up. He's all over the place and not doing too well. He's accusing me of lying to him and killing a part of his soul.

485,NTA,AITA for cleaning my jewelry with my cousins toothbrush?,"Lol I know the title sounds misleading.Anyway my mother passed away 2 years ago and I have some of her everyday wear jewelry. Some of the jewelry is old and I don't think she ever took it to get it cleaned. Recently I asked my dad if he could go get it cleaned for me but he's been putting it off so he never got the chance.Today I woke up and decided to take it upon myself to look up diy cleaning solutions. The jewelry I chose to clean weren't real gold or diamonds or even expensive so I figured it was safe. I found a simple baking soda and dish wash solutions. The steps also said to use a clean, fresh toothbrush in case an old one may have unknown harsh chemicals. Well I had everything but a toothbrush so I decided to go and ask my cousin (who I live with) if she has one.Me: ""hey B, you got a toothbrush?""B: ""Sure.""Then she gave me one and made some joke about how only old ladies have spare toothbrush but she wanted to always be prepared in case someone needed. By this point she already gave me the brush and so I went to clean the jewelry.Fast Forward and I asked her opinion like 2 times on if the jewelry looked differently to her. Finally when I went to show her the finished product, she saw the toothbrush in the solution and got mad. She asked if I used the toothbrush to clean the jewelry and I said ""yeah."" She said she would've just given me an old one, but I said I couldn't use an old one for the reason above. Then she said ""what if someone spends the night and actually needed to use it to brush their teeth?"" By this point I'm kind of ""???"" because she also told me she literally has multiple packs of toothbrushes just in case. Eventually I told her I'll just buy another one for her and she's basically been ignoring me.I mean of course I'll buy her another one, they're the cheap ones so it's literally 75 cents at most. But I was just wondering if I'm TA for not specifically telling her what the toothbrush was for?",93,30,2020-07-14 14:20:03
49,NTA,AITA for forcing my foster daughter to go to church?,"My husband (50M) and I (46F) are foster parents, usually for teen girls. We currently have three daughters S (15), J (14) and B(15). S is our biological daughter and we adopted J when she was 13 and B and she was 15. Every Sunday, my husband and I go to church. The kids are invited but arent required to go. We have a cute like downtown area with shops and little food places near the church so usually Ill give the girls around $30 between them to buy themselves breakfast and let them window shop. Weve recently taken in a 4th girl, called H (14). When we asked H if she wanted to go, she said no and that she wanted to stay at the house while we are out. I told her that its usually an all day outing because after church the family usually goes shopping for the next weeks food and maybe out to lunch. H was labeled as a flight risk, but I wanted to show that we trusted her so I let her stay home. She was no where to be found when we got back and we had to call her case worker and go find her. Luckily they found her and brought her back that night. The next week I told her that she had to come with the family out because I couldnt trust her not to leave. I told her she could stay with the girls and get breakfast/coffee and hang out. While my husband and I were in Church, H took the money I had given the girls and ran away. She didnt get very far and was brought back to us again. The week after that I told her that since she cant be trusted not to run away or steal she had to come into the service with us. She could have her headphones in and listen to music, but she had to be sitting next to us. Our case worker told us that this was an acceptable consequence because of her past behavior. We went and she sat in the service the whole time listening to music on her phone, but she wasnt happy about it. I explained to her that once we were able to trust her not to try and run away when she wasnt supervised she could stay home or go with the other girls. H is a good girl, and is for the most part well behaved. Like the other three girls she is in therapy but she just seems to not want to stay with any home that cares about her. I was having a conversation with a friend of my husband who also fosters ( younger kids under 10 ). I told him about how H had to go to church with us because of her past behavior and how we are hoping we can work through whatever feelings she has and hopefully stop her from running. Friend told us that it was wrong to have H come to church with us when she didnt want to go and we should just let her stay home. Hes never had a child with a history of running so I dont think he understood the situation. We ended up getting into an argument about it because we live close to a big city where sex trafficking is common. I honestly care about H and I dont want anything to happen to her. He eventually told me that we were bad foster parents because H kept running away and it must be something we are doing. AITA for forcing H to come to church?Edit-Hello! This blew up way more than I thought it would! Im getting a lot of repeat questions and Im struggling to answer them all! Here are a couple of the common ones,Where is she running?   She doesnt really have a PLACE shes going to, shes mostly just running for the sake of running. Currently we think she is running because she WANTS to be found, because if she really wanted to leave us we wouldnt have found her so easily these past two times. Can one of you stay home and the other go to church?    Right now, her caseworker believes that us disrupting our entire family routine to keep her home and prevent her from running away gives her control and authority over the family. She wants H to be as much part of the familys routine as possible to try and show her that we care.",7330,977,2020-07-10 20:13:22
741,NAH,AITA For Not Switching Classes?,"So, at my college every freshman has to take a seminar. There are a lot of them, and they're all on different topics. I picked my seminar, the only one I found interesting, and waited all morning for my registration window to book my spot, which worked out and I got a spot.Now recently my college declared that our classes will be in person for the most part but that students can choose to do remote learning if they want to. This had been perfectly fine and hadn't affected me at all until today, when I got an email about my seminar class.This email said my seminar class moved to a remote setting because these classes are larger than normal and they want to reduce the spread of germs in classrooms. I was totally okay with being moved online, it doesn't adversely affect my schedule and I still get to take that specific class. However, they then asked for me to consider switching to a different seminar on a different topic that would be in person so that my spot could go to a student who will be studying remotely so it is easier for everyone involved. I want to say no because this was the only seminar I was interested in and it was a first come first served set-up to get into that class. But, I also feel a little guilty for anyone that is studying remotely that will need special measures for them to take a seminar offered in person as opposed to remotely.So, AITA for not changing to a different seminar?{UPDATE}: Thank you everyone for your advice, I really appreciated it. In the end, I ended up sticking with my chosen class and I'm excited to start this coming semester! Thanks again for the advice, as well as for the support.",27,24,2020-07-13 19:59:43
968,YTA,AITA for refusing to pay for an incorrect delivery order that I ate?,"A group of friends and I were over at a friends house recently, and we decided to order Mexican food on Seamless. 20 minutes later (which was surprisingly fast considering the estimated delivery time was 35-45 minutes and Ive come to expect fairly accurate estimates from Seamless, if anything the restaurant will take a little longer than the estimate) our food comes, and its not the correct order. The receipt, which is stapled to the outside of the bag, has someone elses name on it, and shows a different order as well as having been ordered on GrubHub. Starving, and after a quick discussion about our moral dilemma, my friends and I decide to eat the incorrect order, and I call the restaurant to ask about my order. They apologize profusely, promising that the correct order is on the way. Sure enough, the doorbell rings again, and its the same delivery guy from before. He hands over our correct order, and asks for the incorrect order back. We tell him that weve eaten it, and he becomes upset, telling us that we should have checked the name on the receipt before opening it. He then tells us to contact the restaurant (while he waits there) and tell them weve eaten the other order. The restaurant picks up, and tells us theyll be charging us for BOTH meals, to which I respond absolutely not, and I remove my debit card immediately from my Seamless account just in case they try to charge me anyway (if thats even possible without my consent). The delivery guy leaves, clearly still angry, but in my view, the restaurant fucked up and we caught a lucky break for extra food. AITA?Edit: just to clarify, my friend picked up the first order from the door and we only realized it wasnt the correct order after the delivery guy had left (the first time).

592,YTA,AITA for leaving my poor choice of words at my son?,"Edit: Intended the title to be AITA for leaving my son out of my will and insulting him  for his behaviour , but got mixed up while changing the title.I (52M) divorced from my wife(48f) after i realized that i was gay 2 years back .We had a son from the marriage and i and my ex seperated on good terms. I tried seeing my son (he was 15 at the time of our split) , but he refused to see me  and called me a faggot . One he passed out of school  he contacted me saying that he forgave me and if i could pay for his college education . I told him no and that he is welcome nowhere near me and i do not consider him my son anymore and won't get anything from my will and he can go stick his homophobic ass anywhere else , because of the distress he put me through after the divorce and him calling him me a faggot built up resentment in me towards him. My ex later told me that i wasn't obliged to pay his fees , but  should have been more polite to him . AITA for my poor choice of words towards my son?&#x200B;",48,60,2020-07-10 15:59:21
897,NAH,WIBTA for asking my mom/sister to stop singing a song to my baby?,"My wife and I have a baby girl and we love her so much. Shortly after she was born, I made up a song for her. I borrowed a tune from a childrens song, but the words are my own. Whenever I sing this song to her, her face lights up and she starts giggling. (She is 9 months now but she has been smiling at the song since 2 months.) Last month my sister came to start living with us to help babysit in exchange for lower rent portion. My mom came to visit for a few weeks to help sister transition. As soon as they learned that this particular song lights up my daughters face, they started singing it to her constantly.I know this isnt really a big deal, but Im feeling a little down. Like....thats my song. I made it up. It was a special daddy-daughter thing we had together. I dont want to take away from their relationship with her but now that they started singing it, I feel like Ive lost something that was special between me and her. If I ask them to stop, would they feel like Im making it into more of a big deal than it should be? Even if I am NTA, I still might not ask them to stop. If I did, I would feel self conscious every time I started singing it after that. Its a silly predicament, but one without an easy solution.",17,11,2020-07-15 19:17:26
247,NTA,AITA for telling off a sneaky dog photographer?,"I lived in a residential area in the UK and am fairly well-known to my neighbours for the fact that my three dogs like to sit and stare out the front window; I live right beside a school too, so that also makes it a bit of a excitement for the children to see.I dont mind the people that point them out as I think its cute, but what gets on my nerves are the adults who will stop their kids and say oh look! Wow, look at the dog! And who will be there for a good five minutes just staring. The room there at the front is my living room and its a bit uncomfortable to be on my sofa and have people six feet away just staring and laughing at my dogs for five minutes. I normally just tell the dogs to get down, though, and that solves the issue.Anyway, today was a bit different. I was sitting and this lady and her friend (both mid-30s) walk past and stop. I normally have less patience for people ogling my dogs when they dont have kids with them, but whatever. They could clearly see my sitting there in my PJs and then one of them said ooh lets get that picture for ___ like we said! and took out her phone and snapped a photo. I went outside and youd definitely see me in my pyjamas in the background, but also the idea of people taking photos of my dogs without my permission, alongside the inside of my house, really bothers me.I went to the window and said hey, could you not? Its one thing to look but dont take pictures of the inside of my house without permission and she marched off. A few hours later shes posted on the ridiculous neighbourhood page we all have complaining about me.Am I the asshole? Do I just need to get over people taking pictures like that? I know my dogs are cute but theyre literally just chilling in a chair, not doing tricks or cuddling or whatever. I just feel uncomfortable about the whole unwarranted photo and staring when theres no little kids or when it goes on for 2+ minutes.",633,158,2020-07-09 17:32:42
63,YTA,AITA for not offering a family heirloom ring to the daughter who got married first?,"I have two daughters, Claire and Emma, who have never gotten along well. Claire was the rebellious one growing up, hated any type of societal expectations, and Emma was much more conventional. Claire began dating her now husband when she went away to college and the first time she brought him home my husband was not happy. He had black nail polish and a streak in his hair. I actually had a conversation with my husband about how he can't be such a pompous ass and he is going to drive Claire away. Neither of us like her husband, but we try to bite our tongues. He did not ask my husband for her hand in marriage and when they told us they were engaged she already had a ring.Emma also met her husband in college and he was much more clean cut and someone my husband would approve of. Emma's fiance came to us before he proposed and asked permission. This did endear him more to my husband and my husband told him that he had a family heirloom ring he had received in his mother's will and if he wanted to use it for Emma he could. It is a very expensive ring and it was left to my husband on the condition I never wear it (long story, MIL hated me) He did offer it to me but it didn't feel right. Emma's fiance accepted the ring and Claire found out and thinks that we punished her for making different choices, being with a man we don't like, and not going along with a ""sexist tradition"" I feel like it was my husband's ring to do what he wanted and since Claire's husband didn't tell us before he proposed, she already had a ring and we are not playing favorites.",5845,1560,2020-07-14 21:28:48
191,YTA,AITA for telling my girlfriend that she's not trying to make a connection with my children?,"I have four sons, ranging in age from twelve to five. My wife died four years ago and I've been dating my girlfriend for about five months now. There have been multiple times now where one of my children have gone up to her, trying to show her something or asking to watch a television show with her or something along those lines, and she just rebuffs them. For an example, my ten year old is very interested in cooking, and so is my girlfriend, so I brought up to them that maybe they could try watching a cooking show together or trying to cook something simple. Her response? ""He's too young to be into cooking.""  My youngest is very hyperactive and has some learning issues. Recently, I taught him how to read a page in his favorite book and he tried to show my girlfriend because he was really proud of it. She refused to look at it and said ""I don't want to see your stupid book."" A week ago, I took her aside and said that she wasn't attempting to make a connection with any of them, and we cannot move foward in our relationship if they didn't have a friendship of some sort. I said early on that she didn't have to be a mother, but she had to be nice and at least try and show some interest in them. She replied that ""They were too immature to spend time with."" Let me make it clear that my two eldest are very mature and responsible for their age. My seven year old has his moments of immaturity and my youngest is hopeless in that area, but each and every one of them have tried to interact and every time, she refused and rebuffs. But, apparently, my statement was harsh and she had been very cold and distant. She told me earlier that I had hurt her feelings by not seeing that she was making attempts to be their friend.",1159,305,2020-07-12 03:39:59

953,NTA,"AITA for not honouring a conversation I had with my friend 3 years ago, saying I would make him the best man at my wedding?","I (26M) have had this friend (Daniel) since I was 6 years-old. We have been part of the same circle of friends since this age and there are 5 of us in total (Me, Anthony, Benjamin, Clayton and Daniel).I told Daniel 3 years ago that if I were to ever get married, he would be my best man. But since then, I have grown a lot closer to our other friends and now would say I love them all equally.Since 3 years ago, Daniel has become quite a toxic person. Nothing is ever his fault in his eyes and he ALWAYS blames others for the things that go wrong in his life. Despite this, we still try to be supportive friends to him.I recently got engaged to my partner Ellie (28F) and when we announced our engagement; our friends came round to celebrate. Except Daniel, who didn't come because he said he was cooking dinner.I was fine with Daniel not coming round, it was late in the evening and was also short notice.When my other friends were round, we spoke about wedding plans because we were obviously excited. We discussed the stag do and then the topic of best man came up.I said to them 'best man' seemed quite high-school-playground-esque to me now e.g. ""i love you all but YOU'RE my FAVOURITE friend"". It felt unfair to pick one person when all 4 of them have always been there for me.I told them that I would love each of them to play a role in the wedding.Anthony to do the speech, Benjamin to do the stag do, Clayton to be one ring bearer and help pick suits; Daniel to be the other ring bearer and wait with me at the alter on the big day, to calm my nerves. I am happy with my choices on who will do what role, as I have picked what I feel is each friend's best quality (public speaking, party animal, stylish, loyalty). I know it feels very ""participation award"" but that's what would make me happy and felt the fairest thing to do, considering I would not want to leave anyone out.I said to Anthony, Benjamin and Clayton that I would ask them all again more formally in a few weeks time over a meal. I figured I could tell Daniel about it then as well face to face, rather than over the phone.Since then, Daniel has spoken to Benjamin and Clayton behind my back saying he is pissed off because I haven't asked him to be in the wedding party yet and was EXPECTING to be best man. Ellie and I have only been engaged for a week...Daniel also said to Benjamin that I ""promised"" 3 years ago if I ever get married, he would be the best man. Although I DO remember this conversation, I was also very intoxicated. Apparently Daniel has already written some of the best-man speech because of this conversation we had.I feel bad about this, but at the same time he IS still technically being a ""best man"" of sorts, just alongside 3 other people?Benjamin told me that Daniel wants to be best man by himself because that is what I apparently agreed 3 years ago. Benjamin said he understands if I ask him to step down from his role.So, AITA for not ""honouring"" this drunken conversation I had 3 years ago?",16,22,2020-07-10 00:19:07
714,YTA,AITA for telling my husband he wouldnt make a good dad?,"Hi, throwaway because my husband is frequent Redditor! Alright- so Im pregnant! It all happened so fast, our child was a surprise to both me (25F) and my (27m) husband. Weve been married almost 2 years and weve been together since highschool. My dilemma comes here, Im very excited about our baby, Im reading parenting books, and shopping for the nursery, etc.. My husband however doesnt seem to be too fazed by it, he never really talks about my pregnancy or how hes excited to be a parent. The only time Ive heard him really talk about kids is when I bring up the topic.To me, this was strange because ever since highschool, all throughout our engagement, and the latter part of our marriage, hes been so enthusiastic about being a dad. Growing up around small children constantly, its been my dream to be a mother since I was a literal baby. I was discussing names with my sister in law, and my husband (E) kept shutting down my choices when I asked why he said because they sound stupid. Me: why do they sound stupid?E: they just do, I dont want my kid to have been named after a flower (I suggested Chrysanthemum)Me: okay, so what names do you suggest?E: I dont know. Me: its a pretty name an I like flowers, so why not?E: okay, I love wrestling, Im not gonna name my kid after a wrestler. Me: I wouldnt expect you toE: all the names sound stupid. I was really angry and upset at this point, he had dismissed every single name I suggested and he would change the topic from baby related things to whatever was on TV at that moment. After his sister left I asked him what his problem was, I asked him why he was being such a jerk and and he responded with, Im just tired of hearing the same shit from you every day. I began tearing up and I asked him if he even cared about the pregnancy, and if he really only wanted to have kids because I had talked it up so much. He went silent for a bit and said that he didnt want to have this conversation. To which he walked off into the kitchen. I started crying and I told him that he was going to be this negligent, he would make a very bad father. I feel bad and I have no one else to go to for a second opinion, also, sorry for the format, Im on mobileUPDATE:: me and my husband had a long talk the next day. He told me that at first he was excited about becoming a father. But then I actually got pregnant.. He told me that he didnt feel prepared to become a father and that in truth, he really didnt want this baby. He just liked the idea of being a father without actually being one. I obviously broke down, I am really upset about this and I dont know what to do. Just an FYI- the name Chrysanthemum was just an example of 1 name I suggested, youre right, its terrible name. For those asking, I am about 5 months.",31,49,2020-07-13 06:44:40
590,YTA,AITA for not sharing my food with someone who just spent $600 on me?,"This happened a few years ago. I was at a waterpark with a few friends for my birthday. It was a group of 15. We all planned to just pay for ourselves and have a good few hours, but one of my friends decided he would pay for everyone as a gift to me. I tried to talk him out of it but he insisted on spending nearly $600 so no one else had to pay.A few hours after, we all decided to congregate near the food court and get something to eat. The friend who paid for everyone's admission didn't order any food and instead thought we'd all share with him. Some people gave him a couple fries, someone bought him a drink, but I didn't want to share my food. I had a burrito, how do you even share that?Upon hearing I wouldn't share, he got cold and left the waterpark early. I actually haven't spoken to him since then because he removed me from Facebook.This is a situation I think about often when I'm laying in bed. Was I in the wrong for not sharing despite him spending $600 for the group? It was my birthday, why should I even share?",52,59,2020-07-14 16:51:13
214,YTA,AITA for requesting that people do not order meat for my birthday dinner out?,"For my birthday last year, I took out a group of about fifteen friends to a Moroccan restaurant. I was feeling generous and I like the tradition that some countries have that the birthday person pays for everyone's food. However, I am vegan and I do not like the idea of paying for and people eating meat and animal products at a celebration for me. I announced that I would be paying for everyone as long as they did not order meat (I decided that excluding animal products would be too difficult for many to figure out). The restaurant has several vegan options including falafel, veggie kabobs, pita, hummus, dolmas, etc. Everyone heard my request and generally enjoyed the meal.I noticed that two people (sitting a bit further away from me, if it matters) ordered chicken or lamb when the food came. I was irritated by this, but decided not to say anything since the damage was done, as I felt. When dinner wrapped up, I paid for the food and everyone went their separate ways.Back at home with my roommate, I complained about the two who ordered and ate meat contrary to my request. He said that he didn't really mind not eating meat, but that I was wrong to ask people to not order meat.I was thinking about this today, and I want to hear what the consensus is: AITA for requesting that people not order meat for my birthday dinner?EDIT: Im not sure why me being vegan has triggered so many people on here. For any of you who hate vegans, on behalf of all vegans, I am sorry if one of us made you feel bad one time or was mean to you and hurt your feelings or something like that. Nobody should ever be made to feel bad about literally anything ever. For those who are so certain I am TA, I want to invite you to my birthday party this year, its gonna be at my favorite Moroccan restaurant and dont worry, its on me. Make sure you bring a big appetite :)",877,777,2020-07-12 00:37:54
839,YTA,AITA for refusing to feed the cats this morning,"A little background: my bf and I have been dating for about 3 years now and living together for the last 5 months. He's been working full time and doing school up until about two weeks ago, so I've taken on most household responsibilities (i.e. cooking, cleaning, shopping, etc.) until he wasn't so busy. Also, I have recently been diagnosed with a disease that makes me not have a lot of energy right now. I am getting treatment, but it's still at about another week before I finish that and hopefully feel more normal.Now, onto the story. We currently have three cats in the apartment. My cat, his cat, and my sister's kitten (our former foster), who is staying with us until my sister moves into her new apartment next week. Right now, the cats are on a feeding schedule because the vet said his cat needs to lose some weight. I usually feed them right before I leave for work in the morning (around 7:15) since he doesn't wake up until about 10:00 or 11:00 (he works an mid-day shift). I also wake up at 7:15 on weekends to feed the cats while my bf sleeps in. This morning I woke up around 6:30 and decided that, rather than be productive, I was going to laze around in bed until the very last minute. I was messing around on my phone a bit and, around 6:45 the kitten starts jumping up on the bed and meowing in my face, wanting fed. Normally I would get up and feed her but this morning she also started biting me which is behavior I do not want to reinforce, so I stayed in bed. My boyfriend woke up (the kitten has a VERY loud meow) and told me the cat wanted to be fed. I told him I would feed them before I left, but I didn't want the kitten to think biting was an appropriate way to wake someone up. He continued to urge me to go feed them until I got mad and snapped, saying that if he wanted her to be quiet, he could feed them himself. He got up and did that, but when he came back to bed, he was clearly upset with me. AITA for refusing to feed the cats this morning and making my bf do it?&#x200B;EDIT: A lot of people seem to think I was refusing to feed the cats at all. I was simply waiting to feed them for 15-25 minutes until I got up for the day. The plan was to feed them at their normal time.EDIT 2: The kitten is not starving. I give her multiple small meals (along with the other cats' regular feeding) throughout the day since I know she is growing and needs to eat more. She was biting me because she was impatient for the wet food I give the cats in the morning. She loves that stuff and is always eager to eat it.EDIT 3: I realize there are better ways I could have dealt with the situation. I talked it through more thoroughly with some of my coworkers and realized there are some other things that I'm also upset about which probably affected my behavior during this situation. I'd like to thank everyone who did not accuse of of neglecting/abusing my cats for their advice and opinions on the situation.",21,61,2020-07-09 12:57:01
67,NTA,AITA for telling my siblings I don't care that both of our parents are dead?,"I know how that title sounds, but hear me out. I'm the third of four siblings and I had a pretty shitty relationship with my parents. Dad openly disliked me from day one because he believed that I was the result of an affair Mum had (she admits to the affair happening but denies the other guy is my father). Mum resented me because she blamed me for the problems that belief caused between her and Dad. Neither of them were particularly subtle about their disdain towards me and I very much felt excluded/like the black sheep of the family my entire childhood.Things took a real nosedive when I was a teenager. Dad developed a drinking problem and he was a very verbally nasty drunk. I usually took the brunt of the emotional abuse he'd hurl out. On occasion he'd go for one of the other siblings and they could turn to Mum for comfort and they'd get it. When I went to her after he'd been shitty to me, she'd ask what I'd done to upset him, explain why I deserved it or just straight up ignore me. Dad officially disowned me as his son when I came out as gay at 16, and mum stood by him. I moved out on my 18th birthday and went as low contact as possible. Despite him being the one to disown me first, Dad didn't take kindly to being cut off and did his damndest to cause trouble for me afterwards. This includes, but is not limited to, him ruining one of my first real relationships by feeding my ex boyfriend malicious lies, causing so much drama at my former workplace that I got fired and showing up to my wedding reception 4 years ago, despite not being invited, causing a scene and ruining the day. Mum, again, stood by him and took his side through all of this. Dad died of pancreatic cancer two and a half years ago, and Mum died of diabetes-related complications earlier this year. I didn't shed any tears or go to either funeral because both of them made my life hell. Next week would've been their ruby wedding anniversary. My siblings are arranging a celebration in their honour and asked me to come. I said absolutely not. When prodded for an answer as to why, I said that I don't care that they're dead so why would I go to a memorial. My siblings are now chastising me that that's a horrible thing to say and they were still my parents no matter what and I'm being childish/refusing to let go of the past. Are they right? Am I being an arsehole?",5390,375,2020-07-13 15:16:20
706,YTA,AITA for telling my close friend she needs to be better at sex to maintain relationships.,"One of my bffs had a long call with me this weekend lamenting the loss of another potential guy. We've had these calls quite often over the years and I know 100% the reason guys don't stay with her. She's completely selfish and terrible in bed. How do I know? Well, I now her and how she talks about sex with partners, and I dated someone in the past who had also had a fling with her.Usually I let her vent but this time I thought it went too far. The guy she's seeing was great! (Of course pandemic notwithstanding, I'm sure it had some pressure on their relationship.) He was smart, cute, sexy, and kind from what I saw. I bet it had something to do with how she's basically a starfish in bed, treats BJs like they're moving mountains, and basically sticks to 1-2 things in her little box of ideas.I told her in no impolite terms that sexual compatibility is important (I went through the same challenge with my bf where we agreed upon a compromise around anal because we both loved everything else about the relationship). In this day and age, guys want adventurous women and it's going to be hard to find someone compatible if your bar is very high. You might find someone but it'll take time. After the call, our group chat blew up where she vented to the group that I was telling her it's her fault for not getting good guys because she doesn't put out like <my name> and that <my name> thinks being a good girlfriend is being a good slut for your man. I felt insulted and told her not to talk about me like that again and my friends were mixed in their support.AITA for telling her what needs to be said bluntly after years of having the same conversations?",34,44,2020-07-10 18:17:28

I told her that I didn't want do anything for it and that the perfect birthday for me would be me being able to spend the entire day in my office not having anyone ask me do anything for them.You see, this quarantine has been very hard on me because I'm not used to spending this much time with my family as I usually work long hour days at my office with a pretty long commute, so my does most of the homemaking (she's a sahm). Because  of working at home now and my kids are out of school, I have been overwhelmed. They are constantly asking me to do stuff and are overall annoying right.  So I thought I could just get one day to relax without them badgering me.My wife was taken aback from my request and said that maybe we could do something small for my b day. I insisted that we do nothing for my birthday and that the best gift she could give me would be her handling all of the childcare that day. She told me ""fine whatever"" in a snarky tone and I didn't respond.She was weird with me up to my birthday, but I just ignored since I didn't want to fight with her.  Yesterday (my birthday), I told my kids thanks for saying happy birthday and told them to not try to speak with me for the day since I would be relaxing. They seemed fine with it and that was that. I went along with my day and it was absolutely amazing. No cake, no kids, no wife, just relaxing. I honestly needed it. The problem is that now today my wife has been upset/bitchy with me and my kids have been basically ignoring me. It is honestly very immature imo.

90,NTA,AITA for making a rule about social media for my adult son and his girlfriend?,"I have a 20 year old son who I'll admit I have a strained relationship with, which makes it hard sometimes to enforce normal boundaries. He was staying with his mother and stepfather since his school shut down in March, but my ex threw them out and they needed a place to stay. He says it is because he hates her husband, but my ex said it's because his girlfriend is disrespectful, so it's probably somewhere in the middle.I'm currently dating someone who is semi-famous. She did some child modeling, was on broadway for a little while, and is now having success in the music industry. She also has a massive social media following. My son seems to like her, though he is always bitching that she's too young for me, but I think he just doesn't like seeing me happy. I'm going to call my girlfriend Chloe and my son's girlfriend Riley.Riley is driving Chloe insane. Every time Chloe tries to take pictures or do a livestream Riley tries to get involved. Chloe actually blocked Riley on all social media so she couldn't tag her and Riley confronted her, crying and saying Chloe is a narcissist who can't share the attention. Riley wants to be famous but she goes back in forth between what she wants to be famous for, which makes me think she's just fame hungry as opposed to Chloe who is a serious musician.Well Chloe and Riley ended up in a huge fight the other day because Riley was trying to convince Chloe that they should do a duet (Chloe doesn't even make those decisions, she has a managed, but Riley isn't very smart) and Chloe pretty much told Riley to let it go and she isn't special. Well an hour later I was taking a picture of Chloe by the pool and Riley tried to get in the frame. Chloe just got pissed and stormed off, so I told Riley and my son that they are not allowed to take any pictures with or near Chloe and to stop trying to mooch off of her success. My son said I'm an asshole and begged my ex to let him move back in, but she just laughed.",3794,296,2020-07-11 16:24:02

Sorry for any grammar mistakes and spelling.I (f14) didnt want to wear any makeup for my birthday party because the last time that makeup was applied to me, my eye got swollen because of the makeup. My mother said that she was going to apply makeup to me, and I refused because of what happened the last time that I put on makeup, and that I also didnt want to wear any makeup because I believed that it didnt look good on me.My mom got really mad and started insulting me and accusing me of being of not being an actual woman and being a man because only men hate makeup (idk she has always had this mindset). These comments upset me for many reasons and we started to fight. When the actual party happened, I was in a very bad mood and my mother got very angry again because I was in a bad mood and that she has worked very hard for the birthday party and that she has been working a lot and spent a lot of money for the party. She stated that I only exist to screw up her life. We started fighting in front everyone which basically ruined the party.I have asked the opinion of my brother and he said that I am the asshole because I couldve just pretended to be happy for the sake of my birthday.

The other three bathrooms just have showers, not tubs.One of our roommates, ""Annie"", to be perfect frank, has a horrible personality. She's very entitled and pompous. She moved in to my home as a renter after her parents refused to allow her to live with them rent-free and do nothing but party and sleep. Annie has a little sister, ""Bella"", 18, who is basically a younger version of Annie. Annie has a horrible personality and she's been rude to the other housemates, but she pays all her bills on time so the housemates voted to let her stay so I haven't kicked her out. We recently discovered that Annie snuck Bella into live in our house without telling anyone. Bella has been using our hot water, our Wi-Fi, and eating our food, without reimbursement. When we discovered her Annie seemed to think she was entitled to allow Bella to live with us. At first Annie refused to pay for Bella but after we threatened to evict her Bella got a two-day a week job and helps with bills. I recently caught Bella in my closet trying to ""borrow"" my clothes and subsequently put an electronic lock on my bedroom door.The other day I was chilling in my room after work when Bella started pounding on my door demanding to use my bathroom as all the other bathrooms were occupied. I refused to let her in. Later on Annie called a house-meeting and accused me of rudeness over refusing to let Bella use my bathroom. Apparently Bella has fallen at work and screwed up her back and wanted to soak in my tub. I defending myself with the fact that I pay more rent than everyone else specifically so I have a private bathroom and Bella could have taken a hot shower and gotten the same results. I also pointed out that Bella has a thievery problem and I can't trust her in my bedroom.Annie is, naturally, on Bella's side in thinking I'm an asshole. Our housemates, ""H"", ""K"", ""Y"" and ""C"" are split evenly. They all believe no one is entitled to my private bathroom but that I could have been a lot nicer to Bella since she was injured. They also think I'm being a little dramatic putting a lock on my door and have said it makes them feel like I don't trust any of them. H also said it would have been really hard for Bella to steal anything if I was on the other side of the bathroom door.Was I an asshole for not letting Bella use my bathroom?",38,33,2020-07-13 03:48:47
344,YTA,WIBTA if I don't let my girlfriend park in the garage after she moves in?,"I (32/M) have been dating my girlfriend (29/F) for a year and a half.  Her lease is coming up for renewal in a few months and I was thinking of asking her to move in with me.  We spend most of our time at my house anyway as I live alone in a house I bought and she has roommates at her apartment.I have a two car garage.  There are two cars in there.  One is my Honda Civic that I use for my day to day stuff and I also have a 1980 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am.  This was my dad's car (who passed away a few years ago).  I don't drive it much but I do like to keep it in good condition.There is street parking available, which is where she usually parks when she comes over, but I guess I feel a little bit like an asshole if I tell her she can't park her car in the garage after she moves in because I'm already using both spots.  Also, being on NextDoor I do see car break-ins from time to time.",282,134,2020-07-10 17:11:41
44,YTA,AITA for saying my wife wasnt my dream girl in a trivia game?,"So my wife and I have been doing a game night every so often with some other couples via zoom since we cant go out and see people lately. We were playing this card game the other night that was like basically a trivia game for couples to play and you are asked a question and you write down your answer and your partner has to guess what they think you answered. If they guess correctly your team gets a point. Whichever couples knows each other the best wins. So some of the questions in this version were a little spicy and one of the questions was Who is your dream man/woman to have sex with. I wrote down my spin instructor, since my wife knows I think shes hot, and thought shed guess her and wed get a point. Well, fuck me, turns out every other husband either wrote down their wife or a celebrity/fictional character. My wife was livid, and upset. I tried to explain I didnt actually *want* to do anything with my spin instructor and I would never even briefly consider being unfaithful, it was just me trying to play the game. She doesnt believe me, saying everyone elses instinct was women who didnt exist or better yet, their wives. I feel really bad, but also really confused. I dont know how to deal with this. Is she overreacting or am I an asshole? (And no need to tell me about the Curb Your Enthusiasm Episode. No I hadnt seen it. Yes Ive seen it now. Almost every man there sent me references to it as soon as the video was off.)",7990,1764,2020-07-14 05:05:51
856,YTA,AITA for wanting my boyfriend to kill a bug?,Its summer so there are more bugs than usual and at my bfs place he commonly keeps the window open without a screen so when I come over from time to time a bug will fly/crawl past. Im 100% one of those girls thats afraid of bugs so usually when this happens I want him to come to my rescue and kill the bug. Weve been dating for 5 years so this is nothing new or surprising. I was at his place last night and 3 bugs flew by he kinda tried to kill one and after that didnt even bother to move and ignored my freak outs. I was a little uneasy asking why he wouldnt kill it and he said not to be petty but if you wont kill the bugs yourself maybe you should go home. This turned into an argument and he asked me if I expected him to kill the bugs and I was like yes and eventually I said it was inconsiderate to just ignore me when I was legitimately feeling uncomfortable. He said I sounded privileged in saying that. AITA?,21,36,2020-07-10 04:22:13
878,NTA,AITA selling stuff my previous roommates stuff left after 6 months,So if you guys have read any of my posts you guys know how messed up my family is. So the latest incident is one of my sisters moved into my house about a back in October of 2019 and I kicked her out in January of 2020. Well she had borrowed some money to pay a lawyer. Well when she left she left allot of furniture here. So I waited till last month for her pick it up and I sold it. Her side is she wasgoing to court to try to get custody back of her kids. She has been denied and they told her she could no longer file for custody. I can't tell you why they were taken from her because of a rule that I'm pretty sure we all know but believe me the kids are better off in another house. I hadn't heard anything other then a f you whenever I see her at walmart until yesterday because she wants her stuff back and I explained that I sold it and it has turned into a shit storm. Her boyfriend is causing problems for me and my friends in my facebook groups and keeps reporting everyone of my posts trying to get me banned from Facebook. So I'm ready for my judgment after explaining the situation so am I the asshole or not??? In case anyone is wondering I do plan on moving asap but the corona virus is making that hard right now.,20,11,2020-07-10 06:14:23
315,NAH,AITA for adding pepper flakes to my wifes cooking?,"I have a huge spice palette. I believe it plays an important part in bringing out the flavors. My wife, not so much.  Recently my wife made a dish and though it tasted really good, I thought it needed some spice. So, I added a couple drops of my ghost pepper sauce and it made it way better. I saw that this upset my wife. She basically said that I was saying that her cooking wasnt good enough, and that she felt like I was desecrating the dish because it traditionally doesnt have spice. I disagree, all that Im saying is that I like spicy food, and I was definitely not desecrating her food. Im just adding stuff that I like. Dishes evolve. Traditionally Italian food has no tomatoes since they were brought from the Americas 500 years ago. I dont think shes mad at me, but shes definitely annoyed. It doesnt help that were both stubborn. Also, when I cook, I specifically dont make it too spicy. So, live and let live? Right? So, AITA? Edit: I added this to my portion not her portion",365,237,2020-07-09 19:04:22

599,ESH,AITA for leaving my home angry after my boyfriend undermined me infront of my child?,"30F, with 2 children, 9yo and 5yo males. My boyfriend (32M) and I have been dating for 4 years.For the past month I have been in mental turmoil. Lost my job due to Covid and struggling to make ends meet, have lost loads of weight, cry often, etc. I'm slowly getting better after doing counseling twice a week via facetime but some days are still hard. So this morning started out horrible to say the least and I've been in a mood upon waking. I've tried removing myself from situations but have failed; due to me living on the 5th floor in New York City and being surrounded by my boyfriend and 2 kids. It's simply impossible. So just to give you guys a hint about my day... I spoke to my BF this morning regarding me being set off so he knows I'm in a bad mood. He said he would make the kids breakfast. 20 minutes later he asks me to finish cooking so he can shower. No big deal. I go in to lay down afterward and read a book. He comes in several times and plops down on the bed and starts blaring youtube videos. So I go on the porch to read. 15 minutes later he is out on the porch trying to get me to watch videos with him. I give him a stern look and say I need to be left alone for right now. He goes back inside. At this point both my boys have come out repeatedly to ask questions like ""Can I get water"" or ""Can I go to the bathroom"". Both questions that neither of them ask normally. Boyfriend comes out again and asks me what I am making for lunch. I'm pissed from being badgered and storm into the house. I make lunch, serve plates and lock myself in the bedroom. Boyfriend then proceeds to knock on the door 3 times for miscellaneous things (such as grabbing his belt, for no freaking reason). At this point I put up my book and go take a shower. All 3 of them continue to badger me by coming into the bathroom.So now I'm making dinner. My youngest comes out several times after I told him to stay out of the kitchen. The last time he came out, my boyfriend is right behind him and starts saying things like ""Ooh careful, mommy's big mad today"". So I look at my son and tell him to get out and stay out because he knows better to be in the kitchen when I am cooking. My boyfriend proceeds to rip me a new AH saying I need to calm the fuck down. So, I left. Grabbed my keys and walked out. Now I'm getting texts saying I'm an AH for taking off.EDIT: Yes, I did communicate multiple times that I wanted to be alone. No, I did not take this out on my kids. The only time I spoke to my kids in a ""harsh"" way was when I told him to get out of the kitchen and stay out, after already speaking to him multiple times about it. I have a strict rule of no kids allowed in the kitchen while I am cooking because they do not need to be around the stove. This is not a new rule, simply because I was having a bad day.As for what I am working on in counseling, in July of 2006 I watched my sister die when we were hit by a drunk driver. I have severe PTSD due to this and always have flair ups this time of year.",47,52,2020-07-13 23:02:54
121,YTA,AITA for threatening to cut my daughter out of my will?,"I have two children who are 21 and 19. My wife did not enjoy being a mother, but in my opinion she was a pretty great one. She did everything she had to and went above and beyond to make sure our kids got to do activities and have fun childhood memories. She went to therapy for years to try to learn to like being a mother and then to learn to cope with the regret of having children. One therapist told her being a mother was kind of like soccer (she played one season as a kid and hated it) it's just an activity that a lot of people like, but my wife will never be able to force herself to like it. She did need a lot of breaks, time with friends, time with just me, but I know she tried.My 21 year old daughter has been clashing with her mother since she turned 12. I really think she just enjoys antagonizing her. My kids definitely both view me as their piggy bank and I don't mind. I'm happy that I'm in a position to give them things. My daughter frequently makes comments about what sort of woman has kids and doesn't want them. The only reason my kids have even an inkling of how their mother felt is because she used to lock herself in the bathroom and cry. They have never been told she did not want them and what annoys me the most is my daughter wants to be a therapist. She should have more sympathy for someone who got so overwhelmed she had to go and cry in the bathroom.I've asked my daughter why she brings it up and if it hurts her. She said she just thinks it's funny, but it really upsets my wife. I told my daughter if she keeps antagonizing her mother for no reason I'm going to cut her out of my will.",2655,723,2020-07-09 16:09:17

113,YTA,Aita for telling my sister she cant live with me because her reason for leaving her husband is dumb?,"So this happened pre corona, around January. My sister hasnt spoken to me since then and I honestly feel like shes dragging this out. All because I wasnt on her side during the separation.So what happened was she attended a work event with her husband. It was a party and everyone brought their spouses. She was  pregnant so she wasnt drinking. Her husband got pretty drunk and she saw him and another coworker flirt, her exact words were His hands were on her waist and her hands were on his lower thighs. They were dancing really close and whispering to each other smiling. My sister got upset and left the party in tears. She went home and and packed her bags and called me asking if she could stay with me and wife for a few weeks as she gathered herself together as she was planning to divorce her husband. I told her to calm down and she told me the full story and I told her that shes overreacting and pregnancy hormones are why shes pissed. I dont consider this cheating and its something they can work through. To divorce other this? He was dancing with someone else. Thats not that serious. Plus you cant just crash at my house for a few weeks because your husband smiled at another woman. She started crying and said Im a horrible brother and she wishes our parents werent dead. I told her not to manipulate me and she blocked me. Its been so long and we havent spoken. Her husband and I have talked but shes not open for reconciliation. Shes had the baby and shes separated from her husband and she lets my wife and daughters come see the baby but not me. Was I really that wrong? If it was physical cheating then I couldve understood but her story just isnt enough for such a drastic reaction in my opinion.",2767,767,2020-07-12 00:49:40
527,NAH,WIBTA if I asked my MIL to stop gifting me/my children family heirlooms?,"My in-laws are in the Snowbird transition of their lives. They are retiring and moving far away to a warmer climate. They are also doing that thing old people do- giving away their heirlooms. Its mostly old crap with sentimental value to them. Also they arent downsizing, just moving, to a new house in a warmer climate.My MIL came to visit and brought along some of these heirlooms. She had them wrapped up and was explaining to me how special they were to her and wanted me to give them to my girls. One daughter is a toddler, the other is still an infant. None of these items are appropriate for my children to have or play with or use until they are grown, so like 15-20 years from now.Im fighting baby and kid clutter every day. My house is small. My husband is messy. Im not a minimalist, but I get excited when my baby reaches a new milestone and I can purge. I guess I have room in my basement to store some heirlooms but I dont like it.My rationale is if these items mean so much, then she can hold onto them and gift them to my girls when they are older, instead of sitting in a box in a damp basement for 20 years until Im supposed to remember they exist. Or she can own the responsibility of storing these items. The whole thing annoys me to no end. WIBTA if I asked her to find either other more eager recipients or to hold onto them herself until my kids are ready to possess them?ETA: INFO- items are a glass vase she got from her aunt for Christmas thats mass produced; a lamp; a seashell sculpture from a local artist; a ring dish, a crystal decanter.

848,YTA,AITA for putting the dog out of my room?,"This just happened a few hours ago but I still do not know if I was an AH or not.Context: My family just got a new puppy, been with us for almost 2 weeks but I rarely sleep with him. He is almost fully housetrained in the bathroom department, but he still has some accidents every few days. He usually sleeps with my cousin in her room, but last night I asked if he could sleep in my room. She accepted, which made it the second time he has slept in my room. I (15m) usually get up around 10 am or so, which is normal and encouraged with the kids right now.Here is where I may be the AH: I was having a nice time sleeping when the new dog woke me up at about 6 am, so I was very tired. I dealt with his noise for a little bit while trying to go back to sleep, but eventually, I got tired of hearing him squirm around on his bed gnawing on a bone, so I took him, his bed, and his bone outside my room and closed the door on him so I could get some more sleep. Note I was super tired and only looking for more sleep at that point, so I forgot to take him outside as it never occurred to me he needed to be taken out.Anyways, about 10 min later, just as I was drifting off, my guardian burst into my room and asked me if I had taken the dog out. I thought she meant outside the house, so I responded ""No?"" because I had no idea what was going on. Again, still tired, I didn't realize that he had probably peed. A few seconds later I heard her talking about his mess, and that was when I realized he probably went to the bathroom.Still trying to grasp the impossible sleep at this point, I tried to go back to sleep, but then my guardian came back in and asked me if I had lied, and I said ""No, I did not lie."" Then she clarified if I had put him outside my room, and I said I did, so she told me to clean up his mess, and I did with no hesitation.TLDR: Put the dog outside my room so I could get some sleep, forgot to take him outside so he could pee, then he peed in the house, angering my guardian.Now Reddit, AITA?",22,19,2020-07-11 14:46:42
116,NAH,AITA for refusing to have a third child with my wife because she wants a boy?,"My (35m) wife (29f) and I have two girls (3 and 2.) She wants to have a 3rd child because, in her words, she wants her ""little prince."" She wants a boy, in other words This is a hot-button issue for me because I was the third boy in my family. It's an open secret that my parents had me hoping for a girl. My parents loved me, took good care of me, and gave me a good life but every time I think about them feeling disappointed when I was born another boy it really hurts my feelings if I'm being honest.So when I consider that we are flipping a coin on our hypothetical 3rd child I can't stand the thought that my wife would be disappointed if it turns out to be a girl. I would like a third kid, but in my opinion we shouldn't have one because we specifically want a son. I asked my wife ""OK, what if we have another girl?"" She answered ""Then we should try one last time. If we have another girl so be it; we are a family of daughters.""  I just think her attitude is wrong and only want to have another kid with her if she doesn't care about the gender.  But maybe I'm being unfair due to personal bias. AITA?Edit: thanks to everyone who posted. A lot to think about. It's possible that I've made too much out of things, but if we do end up having a boy I may have to watch out for her spoiling him, as some have suggested. Adoption is a good suggestion, too.  IVF is a possibility but I find the idea a little creepy, for some reason. Definitely don't want a 4th kid though whatever happens. I got off to a slightly late start as it is.",2725,353,2020-07-13 11:49:30
462,YTA,AITA for not wanting to go to my friend's party after she told me I would be asked to leave if I started drinking?,"I (19F) have been struggling with my mental health for a long time. However, the last few years have been especially bad. I am generally a private person so very few people in my life know what has been going on. My best friend, Rachel, (19F) is the only person I have talked openly to about this.About 18months ago I went off the rails. I would drink excessively at social events and was a huge asshole to a lot of people, especially Rachel. The thing that scared me into getting help was when I ran away from a party that Rachel was meant to pick me up from because I started hearing voices and shit. Rachel spent 2 hours looking for me and it changed our relationship.The next week I made an appointment with a counsellor and I now have regular appointments and am on medication. I was completely sober for the next 3 months but after talking to my psychologist I decided to drink again as I believe that it was the shit going on in my life that was the problem, not the alcohol. I have gotten my drinking and mental health under control and have gone out drinking multiple times with no issues. However, Rachel constantly says that I am an embarrassment to her and she can't trust me when I'm drinking. I have apologised to her multiple times about how shitty I was to her but I have also explained that a lot of it was due to my poor mental health at the time. However, she still continues to make comments about me being an alcoholic and brings up my past actions which I have explained is hurtful and makes it harder for me to move on. I have asked multiple people in my life if they feel the same way and no-one agrees with her. I don't think that mental health is an excuse but I do think that it can help to explain a situation and that if someone is actively trying to better themselves it should be taken into account.She and one of my other best friends (Lucy) are having a joint party for their birthdays which I was very excited for. It is expected that everyone will be drinking and they are providing alcohol. However, she privately messaged me saying that if I drink I will be asked to leave as she doesn't want me ruining her day. I understand that it's her house and her rules and I wasn't even planning on drinking as I'm working the next day, but being held to a different set of rules over something that happened over 6 months ago, that I have taken multiple steps to address, have apologised for multiple times, and haven't even come close to repeating for 6 months has really hurt me and made me not want to go at all.I have spoken to my friend Sarah (20f) about the situation and she says I'm over-reacting and that it seems like I care about getting drunk more than I care about Rachel and Lucy and that I should just suck it up and go.

711,NTA,AITA for calling out a close friend publicly,"(Im on Mobile sorry for the formatting also English is not my first language Im so sorry if I accidentally confuse anyone) So Ive been friends with this girl and Im going to call her Sam since we were in the 7th grade. Sam and I have been best friends since then and we basically tell each other everything. The other day a friend messaged me a video of Sams private story. In the video she was talking bad about me and saying downright racist and homophobic shit. Basically saying I should go back to my country and that Im going to hell for being gay. I was hurt and offended. I went off on her about how I knew what she said and how racist and homophobic it is. And she kept saying she did nothing wrong. She then went onto Instagram and made a post saying Im a liar and Im accusing her of being racist and homophobic. Basically telling people to not trust me or be my friend anymore. So I went on to all my social medias and posted the video of her private snap chat story. She got mad and said I was breaking her trust and invading her privacy and something about freedom of speech and it didnt matter anyway. So I told her I was hurt and I ended up blocking her. A few hours later I had people messaging me telling me Im a asshole and that Im making a big deal out of nothing and that its just her opinion I dont have to agree with it.

75,NTA,Aita for asking my sister to cover up around my husband?,"My sister (20) broke up with her boyfriend and cant move into her new place until the first so shes been staying with me (f22) and my husband (m23). Shes usually in something skimpy when she visits. I didnt expect her to dress differently staying with us, but I also didnt expect her to go from regular skimpy summer clothes to her bra and panties or short shorts and a bra. Still, it didnt bother me because we grew up naked around each other all the time. Last night my husband asked me to talk to her. He said he isnt comfortable with her walking around like that. I honestly dont care why he isnt, in my opinion, its his house and if he isnt comfortable with it then it should stop. He said hed just like her to throw a shirt on or some longer shorts, hes not asking for her to completely dress like a nun. He also doesnt care what she wears after he goes to bed, before he wakes up, or when he isnt home. This morning I told her wed like her to do that. I said while hes at work she can wear whatever she wants but he isnt comfortable seeing her wearing certain things. She completely lost it. She accused me of slut shaming her, being jealous of her body, and said its not her fault my husband is so attracted to her that he needs her to change her life. I dont think its an issue of him being attracted to her, thinking shes a slut, or me being jealous. I wouldnt want to see his brother in his underwear either. And like I said before, IMO the reasoning doesnt matter. Shes now currently stomping around and refusing to put clothes on. Im ready to tell her to leave if she doesnt like our guidelines. Weve already gotten into it about asking her not to smoke weed in the house and to be quiet after our daughter goes to bed. So am I the asshole for asking her to just cover up a bit?Edit; so I did as most of you suggested and told her she needs to wear more or leave. She called my mom and my mom called me flipping out because my husband must be sick to look at a little girl/his wifes sister and compared it to him seeing our 3 year old naked. She thinks I should try to accommodate her since her boyfriend dumped her and she was temporarily homeless. I told her to take my sister then and she was out early this morning. Thank you all for the input! She really made me feel like it must me something wrong with me to ask her to cover up",4930,548,2020-07-13 20:03:37
493,NAH,WIBTA for making my husband choose less expensive orthodontics?,"So my husband (41M) never had braces as a kid. We have two kids, ages 6 and almost-4. We do fine financially, but are not wealthy. Last year, husbands dentist noticed that his front teeth were chipping. He built them back up with enamel, and told my husband he needed to get his bite issues addressed. This year, his dentist needed to build the enamel back up again because it had already chipped off. The dentist told my husband that he really, really has no choice but to get braces. He referred my husband to an orthodontist, who quoted $6000 for Invisalign. We have $1000 in an HSA we can use towards this and our dental plan will pay $1000, so were looking at $4000 out of pocket for this option. We have a friend who works for a large dental chain. I have not heard great things about this chain, but they do Invisalign for $4000, and our friend says that Invisalign is Invisalign, wherever you get it done. (The friend is not a dentist or hygienist - he fabricates dentures and crowns.) Invisalign through the chain would run us about $2000 out of pocket. I asked my husband to also get a quote for metal braces from the orthodontist, since those are usually less expensive. He said no - he doesnt want metal braces. He wants to just do Invisalign through the orthodontist. He doesnt trust the chain place, and his dentist said that he should not go to the chain place and should see a real orthodontist.I obviously want the best for my husband, but the difference between $2000 and $4000 out of pocket in the next year is a lot of money in our world. We could figure it out if we really had to, but...its a lot of money. I think he should get a quote for metal braces, and if that is out of the question for him, then he should consider doing Invisalign through the chain. WIBTA to insist on this, or should I just suck it up and pay the $4000 out of pocket for Invisalign at the orthodontist?",89,110,2020-07-14 15:29:42

Four years ago, he let Axel stay with him, which ended with Jon calling the police on Axel because his brother had done some awful things in the apartment. I wont say what exactly, as it can be identifying information, but it ended in Jon and his wife starting proceedings for a restraining order between Axel and their three children, as well as Jon pressing charges against Axel for a variety of things.The boys settled it quietly, and never told their father - not even our grandmother, who is the gossip monger of the family, knows what happened. Only my cousins, myself, and my mother, whom Jon asked legal advice from (she was not his lawyer) know what happened.Jon was venting to me about it, saying how much trouble it has been for him and Axel keeps harassing their other brothers about the will their father will leave, trying to weasel his way around and get more than them. Axel is the only one without a family, doesnt own a home, and constantly bounces between apartments. He thinks he needs more of the inheritance so he can finally settle down.I have nothing to gain from this inheritance; its clear cut it will only go between my uncles four boys. But, after Jon told me the details of what Axel did in the apartment, as well as what he has been doing to his brothers, I feel like my uncle deserves to know so that he can make an informed decision of what happens to his money and the benefit of his children and subsequently, his grandchildren.I offered to Jon to tell his father as I am technically a neutral party, with nothing to gain or lose in this situation, but my mother was furious. She thinks Axel needs the inheritance so that he can have a fresh start and I shouldnt be poking my nose into money affairs, and I can sort of see her concerns. But I feel like my uncle should know what his son did.WIBTA if I told my uncle about my cousin so that he can alter his will accordingly?EDIT: To answer some questions:What was Jons response to my offer? - He said I could do it if I wanted, but he wouldnt encourage me one way or the other.Why cant the brothers tell their father? - They worry the stress of the news would affect him, as well as they worry it would look like they are trying to cut one brother out to benefit themselves when that isnt the case. Their worry of Axel getting the inheritance is in him being able to continue what he did in Jons apartment, or pay bail if he got caught.If Axel did something criminal, why arent the police involved/isnt Axel in jail? - the police were involved when the initial event happened, but Axel was released for lack of evidence.Why havent the brothers decided to do it themselves anyways? - They want it to be all three or none at all. Two of the brothers agree, but Jon is the one holding out and since he was directly involved with the event, the brothers wont go through with it. Can you give us information about what Axel did? - It has to do with children. That is all I am willing to say. ",20,57,2020-07-14 14:05:09
425,YTA,AITA for not helping my daughter pay to go to an expensive college?,"I am a teacher, and I believe in the importance of education. have been saving 2k a year for each of my three kids' college since they were born. I had always told my kids I would work them to help pay for college as an investment in their future and to ensure they get through college without big student loans.  **EDIT: We have family members who have been crippled by student loans, so I have always made it clear my goal was to make sure they graduated debt-free.**This year, my oldest turned 18 and got into to three colleges with scholarships, which I am going to call lowest ranked, medium ranked, highest ranked (Using US News and World Reports rankings).The highest ranked college is 25K a year after scholarships.The medium ranked college is 45K a year after scholarships.The lowest ranked school (still a good school, just not as strong as the others) gave her a prestigious fellowship that would ensure she was working with faculty to do research. After the fellowship (26K worth), the school would cost 7k a year.I thought she should go to the lowest ranked school because it was an excellent value for the money and because she would get lots of personalized attention there. She said she wanted to go to the medium ranked school which cost 45K. I told her we couldn't afford the 180K it would cost and asked why she liked it better. It wasn'tbecause it has amajor she is particularly interested in or anything academic, but because that school is in a big city. Isaid being in a big city during college wasn't worth an extra 20 or 38K a year. I said if she wanted to live in a big city, she could do it on her own terms once she graduated and found a job.She stuck to her guns. She wouldn't go to the highest ranked school or the school where she got the fellowship, but insisted on going to the medium ranked school. She was an adult, and I couldn't stop her.If we couldn't afford it, she would take loans. I am against student loans, as she well knows.After many hours of discussion, I told her I would pay for either of the other two schools, but if she chose to go to the most expensive college, I wouldn't support that decision financially, and I would roll college money I planned on using for her down to her siblings. I can't say that I feel good about it, but I can't support her decision.  **EDIT: I can use this money in other ways, like to pay for graduate school or weddings or house downpayments, or even college for grandkids.**So, am I the asshole for refusing to help her pay for an expensive college that I don't think is a good investment in her future?EDIT:  Everyone, thanks for commenting.  Many of you are asking questions which ask me to defend my position, but I have been reminded by the mods of Rule 3, which says I should not ""draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject.""   I will answer informational questions,  but I have been told not to debate this or I will be muted.   Thanks again for your input.&#x200B;",181,341,2020-07-15 14:38:47

232,ESH,AITA for laughing when my bully demands that I apologise for being a bully to his girlfriend?,"I(23 now, F) used to be bullied by a group of boys back in Primary school, and nobody did anything to help me because it was my words against theirs.They would damage my things, pass around funny letters about me, make fun of my looks(I was fat and short) and things like that. My parents weren't much of a help either and were in a way worse but that's another story.I went through a drastic change in personality during my Secondary school years and became bullies just like those boys. I am not proud of it now, but back then it gave me a sense of comfort knowing that I have power over somebody else and a bunch of sisters in crime.I went through another change after going to college when I started to have a healthier way of dealing with negative emotions. My college friends helped me a lot and I got to move out of my toxic family too.It's funny but, I happened to meet one of my bullies again as he studied under my step brother(who moved out years before me). We kind of got to know each other again and along with a few other of the students, we became friends. And the funnier thing is, his girlfriend happened to be one of the girls I used to bully.Here's what happened. The guy who used to bully me has been asking me to talk to his girlfriend, to apologise and make it up to her past trauma as she told him about me.While I no longer bear any ill feelings towards the person anymore, it just struck me in a weird way that my past bully, one partially responsible for my bitter childhood, actually had the nerve to criticise me for being a bully. I laughed, well I did laugh in real but I typed ""HAHAHAHA YOU WOT M8"" before blocking him. My brother told me that I creeped him out. AITA?For context, the guy never apologized to me either. We recognized each other but got together as friends like we were strangers, never talking about the past.The girl however, never liked me, understandably so. We barely talked because she is not one of the students so we would have been fine just pretending neither of us existed but the guy HAD to have us become friends, which is why he wants me to apologise to her.I find this completely ridiculous through, I mean I could apologise, but even if I do I doubt she even wants to see my face. Meanwhile, my bully seems to have completely forgotten how he used to act towards me and is being judgemental.",715,139,2020-07-09 13:28:37
710,YTA,AITA to go on vacation against my mother's wish?,"I (F20) have been always saving up money for my new apartment for school.  My boyfriend and our friends have decided to go on a vacation just to get out of town.  I am in desperate need of a vacation due to personal reasons, but my mother doesn't think so.  She always has had some reason for me not to go on vacation with anyone.  I have quite a bit of money saved up and it would barely cost me anything to pay for the flight, the AirBNB, and the rental car (around $350-$400 all together).  I don't spend money really at all unless it's for stuff I need or the occasional fast food trip.The cabin we got is very isolated in the mountains, only an hour and a half away from the city and the beach.  We aren't going to make trips out every day and we know how to make our own food in case the restaurants are still shut down.  Due to the pandemic, we will be bringing a bunch of masks and will be sure to social distance when we do go out.  We are also taking a COVID test before we leave to ensure that none of us have it.  We just want to get out of state and hang out basically.  But this is not good enough for my mother.She complains that we are going too far away and that we should stay closer, but I have to explain that everyone already put down payments and they're going with or without me (I know I haven't told her that I already have as well, but as of now, the vacation starts next week and I've been trying to talk to her about this for a little over a month so I just need to tell her that I'm going).  She then says it's selfish of me to go because I have an apartment to pay for, but I already have a job lined up and a plan in case everything were to fall through (since my apartment is paid rent by my FAFSA).  She keeps finding reasons on why I shouldn't go and guilt tripping me to where I almost didn't go and just let the money fall through.The other part is that she wants me to be closer to my family who lives a few hours away from where I'm staying.  I think a reason behind it is that she hasn't seen her mom (my grandmother) in a couple years and she's jealous that I'm going and wants me to take the car that all 6 of us are gonna use out to where my relatives live for a day.  I don't want to take the car to do that when others will need it as bad as I want to see them.Basically, AITA for going on vacation with my own money that I have saved up?Tl;Dr : Mother mad at me for wanting to go on vacation and guilt tripping me into not going.  I'm using my own money.  She's afraid the apartment bills will land on her or some other reasons that she makes up on the spot.Edit: I'm not going to see my grandmother!  I don't want to put her at risk or take the car from everyone else! Sorry for the confusion",33,45,2020-07-09 18:23:40
573,YTA,AITA for telling my wife it's not unusual for families who live 2000 miles apart to not see each other regularly?,"My wife was on facebook and saw a picture of her grandmother and got sad that she's looking older. She went on to say that she wishes she could get back to where her family lives more, which comes up pretty frequently. I asked her why she chose to move out here if this was going to be a constant issue. I guess what I said was less than cool, but her family treated her really poorly when she lived with them and took advantage of her and when she moved out here, she was thrilled to be leaving. So it rubs me the wrong way when she acts like she's missing out on not being around them. Then she got mad and told me that it's normal for families that live apart to see each other regularly and I disagreed. I'm poor. I grew up poor, I've always been poor. She knew I was poor when we got together. Poor people don't take cross country trips. My Nana is from North Dakota and it was a huge deal when she got to go see her mother before she passed. Likewise, my Pop saw his mother who lived in Kansas once the whole time I was alive at that point. His family from Alaska visited a few times, but that was because they had money. We also just travelled across country to see my wife's family (on her parent's dime) on a lie her mother told about a dying family member because she wanted my wife to come out for her birthday. It was a terrible time that was very stressful for both of us and they made us sleep in the room where their dogs piss all day. I cannot see why my wife is so eager to do it again. I personally have no desire to go back there. They basically ignored us the whole time we were there and all we did was eat. I think it's their turn to come out here, but they never will because they hate California. They don't like me. I don't understand why my wife wants to do that all over again.",57,69,2020-07-13 02:56:10
307,NTA,AITA for not helping my partner with our sons bedtime when he ignored our routine,"On mobile so sorry for any formatting issues. Td;lr Partner ignored what I'd told him about our sons bedtime routine, said he'd deal with our son getting out of bed, then moaned when I didn't help out. Partner (P) and I have a son (2)(S)who has recently gone through a major sleep regression that has lasted roughly 6 weeks. S's finally worked through it and we're establishing a normal routine again. I've been doing a lot of the bedtimes due to P's shift patterns, and the bedtime routine I have takes about half an hour, which gives S enough time to wind down properly, and I normally don't hear a peep after I leave his room. I've also learnt not to put S down too early, as becomes a jack in to box! A few nights I had to sit outside his room until I was sure S was asleep. I've been telling P about all of this as well, when we've discussed our days. P's shift pattern has changed this week, so he was home a lot earlier. I'm self employed, and tend to work around P's shifts and S's nap times, but during the six weeks of hell I got slightly behind due to S refusing to nap, so I thought I'd use the time to catch up a little. P was fine with this, and was looking forward to doing bedtime. I went into my office, put my headphone on, and cracked on for a couple of hours.I finished up in time to give S a goodnight kiss and cuddle, and P took him up. He was downstairs again within about 10 minutes. When I asked him if everything was OK, he said ""yep, S's in bed, everything's fine."" I was a bit surprised, and told P that I didn't think he'd given S enough time to wind down, and it was early compared to his normal bedtime. P brushed it of, stating ""it'll be fine"", but agreed to put S back into bed if he got out.So I put my headphones in, opened my book, and let him deal with it. Every 5 minutes P was going upstairs to put S back into bed. After about half an hour, I asked P to stay upstairs until he was sure S was asleep, telling him that S was far likelier to stay in bed. After a bit P came back down as all was quiet, and grumbled that I should have reiterated S's bedtime routine before starting work, and that I could have ""tagged in"" a couple of times. I responded with the fact that I've already told him a few times, plus I have had to deal with, and figure this out, on my own. He did acknowledge this and said he should've paid more attention. Thing is, we did agree on 50/50 parenting when we weren't working, so I feel a bit bad. AITA",395,47,2020-07-13 22:58:27
825,NAH,AITA for working out in my apartment?,"So a couple of weeks ago the leasing office of my apartment building left a message that one of my neighbors had complained about noise coming from my apartment and to be more mindful. I was a little surprised, as I am generally pretty quiet I dont blast tv or music, and am sleeping during the early mornings and after around 10-11 at night. Today, I got another call from the leasing office; this time, they specified that my downstairs neighbor has been calling to complain about running, stomping, and jumping coming from my apartment during the day. I realized that this call came about 30 minutes after I had finished working out for the day I typically workout with light weights for about an hour, 4 days a week, since the gyms are still closed in my state and it is upwards of 90 degrees outside. I do not drop the weights on the ground, do not run, and only jump occasionally (most of my exercises are dont require walking/jumping around). I have a hard time believing that any noise that can be heard below me is continuous in any way. I also only workout during afternoons, typically in the early afternoon but sometimes later around 4-5 pm, and have been doing so since March. Apparently, my downstairs neighbor is upset because the noise from me working out is disrupting her while she is working from home. On one hand, I can understand how this could be annoying while trying to concentrate on something important. On the other hand, the noise is not happening for more than an hour at a time, and is not occurring during unreasonable hours I feel like as long as we are all spending so much time inside, we should be a little more understanding of random noise from neighbors. I checked with my leasing office just to make sure Im not breaking any rules and Im not, so I let them know I dont plan on discontinuing my indoor workouts. However, I still feel kind of bad for upsetting my neighbor and am worried that I might be TA. WIBTA if I still continue working out indoors, bothering my downstairs neighbor?Edit: I already workout on top of both a carpet and an exercise mat.",24,18,2020-07-15 02:29:21

Brazil does have a reputation for being the plastic surgery capital of the world, but it's not like I'm taking the five year old there to get a consultation.

She has autism, which is noticeable when you spend a decent amount of time with her and does inhibit her in certain ways but she's also fairly smart and currently in college. We get along pretty well but she can be exhausting to talk to sometimes. She has a hard time picking up on social cues so she will continue talking about something long after everyone else has stopped responding. She can't seem to tell when people are getting increasingly frustrated or annoyed with her until they eventually blow up. The past few months we've all been stuck at home together because of the pandemic (and because I had to move out of a shitty apartment situation on short notice) and I've noticed that she complains quite a lot about being interrupted, taking it very personally and being genuinely hurt whenever she's talked over. And I get it, being ignored sucks. Being interrupted is frustrating. But it's only happening with such frequency because she's at a table with 5 people and doing 80% of the talking, and other people can't find an opening to say anything. It's like every time she opens her mouth she wants to give an entire prepared presentation on whatever we're talking about. She has a lot of very strong opinions--most of which I agree with! But she gets so animated talking about them that she doesn't realize she's not letting anyone else contribute. It's especially frustrating when she's talking about something contentious like politics that other people don't want to talk about and she keeps saying ""I'm not done"" and ""Let me finish"" when people try to change the subject. She's not a mean or selfish person, she's enormously empathetic and sweet. But I think her autism is interfering with her ability to see how she's coming across. I'm afraid of hurting her feelings, she takes stuff like this very personally, but I feel like I have to say something because it keeps causing fights between her and my parents and honestly it's exhausting me too. Is there a non A-hole way to address this with her? TLDR: My sister can't pick up social cues bc of autism, gets very upset that people interrupt her but dominates conversations so it's the only way they can say anything. Is there a way to point this out to her without being an asshole?**Edit: I texted her as gently as I could, explaining that I sometimes struggle to find a break in the conversation when I talk to her but know that interrupting is frustrating. I tried to focus on finding a solution that makes us both happy instead of assigning blame. We settled on me raising my hand when I want to say something so she'll know to wrap up the point she's making. I didn't specifically bring up that this applies to conversations between her and other people but she's smart and introspective and I feel like she will probably at least consider that this might be causing issues with other relationships.

Some days we ask them to help outside to maintain the backyard or whatever if they've nothing else to do outside of the house.Then comes pandemic. They're out of school, not allowed to meet up with groups. We're not in lockdown but not a lot of functions are open yet, so they've been staying home all day.My parents have a farm and they've released employees from seasonal contracts and are trying to do everything themselves with the help of family. In the absence of my kids doing things outside of the house, I've volunteered them to my parents to help once a week for two hours. I've coined it ""exercise time"" because it's manual labor. Nothing crazy: things like weed whacking, mowing, trimming hedges, carrying bales, etc. My kids have complained about this but I think it's fair: two hours a week when otherwise they're just watching Netflix or playing videogames.

I've been burnt before so this time I chose to call a real estate appraiser to appraise the house. The lady appraised it and told me that it wasn't worth what they're selling it for. I inquired with the agent and I got a very sketchy vibe so I walked away. Just told everyone it was too expensive and left it there. My sister ended up buying it for even more than the original asking price because of another interested buyer but she was still ecstatic over the house and didn't waste time boasting about it. At her 'housewarming party' my dad asked how I feel about losing to my sister and I told him I didn't lose since I wasn't the one who paid nearly $45 000 more than the house is worth (including the amount she added to buff out the guy). Obviously my dad asked me to elaborate so I told him. My sister came in, heard and started yelling at me for letting her waste her money on it. First off, it was a private appraisal and the extra could've been the real estate agency's fee. And she loved the house  so she probably would've bought it for the same price regardless. So, was I the asshole?Edit: for the confusion, my sister bought the house with (fixed) assistance from our parents to avoid a mortgage. I got the same deal with my house. Their contribution is the same amount for every house ($65 000)",1393,164,2020-07-13 16:45:16
313,YTA,AITA for cutting off my father and not speaking to him for over 5 years after he refused to pay for college?,"I come from a wealthy family. So wealthy that my dad could have easily paid for my college and it wouldn't even have put a small dent in his savings. Now growing up, we weren't al that close. I had my differences with him and they only exacerbated after our political opinions started to diverge. I was always respectful, but never let myself get dominated in any argument. It all came to a head in my final year of high school where he flat out refused to pay for college. Said that since I agreed I was 'too privileged', I needed to learn about the value of money and to be independent and responsible. I asked him whether saddling me with a mountain of debt that would follow me around for years was really worth it, and he said yes. It really was. We argued, but he refused to budge. Ultimately I decided to bite my tongue and keep quiet. I applied for student loans - during the last stages of the loans being approved he even offered to pay half, but this time I refused. An ego driven decision, sure, but I had friends who weren't as rich as my family and felt I could do it if they could and that it was a small price to get away from my smug, controlling father.I was cordial with dad when I was in college. He helped me out a bit with food and rent - note that I was working part time as well. But when I graduated, got a job and landed on my own two feet, I went full no contact. He's tried to reach out over the years but I have always refused. I'm doing well now. But my girlfriend thinks I'm an asshole for completely cutting off contact with him. So, AITA?Edit - I've been getting dozens of dms of people just cussing at me, all frothing at the mouth. Glad to see we can disagree respectfully. Never change, reddit.",363,246,2020-07-10 03:39:41
251,YTA,AITA for being mad at my girlfriend for comforting a girl at my workplace?,"This happened back in Feb but its still an issue which she brought up recently. The title makes me sound like Im definitely the asshole, but just let me explain:So my (25M) girlfriend (25F) was picking up something at my workplace. This is an office job, but its very stressful. Anyway, I went down to the lobby to handoff the thing my girlfriend needed. I went back up right after. Later that night, my girlfriend was telling me how she went to the bathroom in the lobby, and there was this girl quietly crying. My girlfriend said she stayed for a little bit and comforted her. Now the reason I am really annoyed by this is because that girl had got into a *huge* argument with out boss (she was clearly in the wrong though). She was acting super arrogant about something and basically got chewed out by our boss. He was seriously pissed. Basically what happened was, our boss asked her to get him a tea bag from our coffee station. She thought she was to good for that (this is something that we all have to do from time to time) and they got into a huge argument. Our boss just told her to go home for the day, and the other bosses (our bosss peers) didnt say anything. Obviously people talk, and pretty much everyone agrees that that girl was in the wrong. Sure none of us *like* having to do that stuff, but it rarely happens. Anyway so I guess the girl was crying in the lobby and when my girlfriend told me about what happened, I instantly recognized who she was talking about. I told my girlfriend that I really wish she hadnt done that because I didnt want it to somehow seem like I, by relation, was taking sides against my boss, especially considering that this girl was the one who started the whole conflict. My girlfriend says that regardless, its empathetic to still try to comfort her then. Even once Ive explained everything, she still doesnt think she did anything wrong. She said Im being really cold about this. Am I the wrong one?Edit: okay fine Im the asshole you guys can stop now",612,211,2020-07-12 04:05:12
832,YTA,AITA for trying to help my brother to establish contact with his child that he previously abandoned when he was 18 in order to go to college?,"My brother and his girlfriend became parents at 18 (accidentally) and unfortunately my brother was just too immature at the time and irresponsible and he broke away with her after she decided to keep the child and gone to college instead. But he offered to send money, she didn't want anything from him.His girlfriend Marie skipped the college (that she planned) in order to take care of the baby (i believe at big objections of her parents and other family) and only one helping her was her kid brother Nick. I 28/f tried to offer help myself but she always refused me.Anyway my brother after finishing college decided that he made mistake (and is much more responsible now with a good job already) and he tried to ask Marie for another chance and part in baby life. But she refused him and said that she doesn't want anything to do with him.I tried to intervene and ask her to change her mind, her parents and other sister asked her too but she refused. My brother also had conflict with Marie brother Nick  (who is always around her) at the bar and those those two almost ended up fighting. Unfortunately my brother also said (drunkenly) something stupid to Nick right in crowded bar that just made things a lot worse.So am i asshole for trying to help my brother to reach to his kid despite his earlier mistakes?",22,34,2020-07-12 16:57:42
634,YTA,AITA for sneaking midnight snacks to the family dog?,"I am currently living with my boyfriend and his parents. His parents have a sharpei, Skooshie, who is 14 years old (4 to 5 years past his breed's life expectancy). Personally, I feel that the sharpei gets very little love. Because of his health problems, there are fewer and fewer things he can do to have fun and just be a dog. Skooshie can't run or play much because of his arthritis and his hearing is totally shot, so he can't really hear when you praise him. His fatal flaw though is that he eats so fast he sometimes chokes.The family's solution is to essentially feed him his kibble like cereal: soaked in copious amounts of water. They refuse to feed him anything else because they're worried he will get fat or have an allergic reaction (he has a soy allergy). I feel really bad for him since nobody in the house makes any effort to provide him with any kind of mental stimulation, so I've taken it upon myself.Every night for the past week or two, I will chop up a carrot for crunch, and mix in few other pieces of fruits and vegetables, usually forgotten leftovers or produce on the brink of expiration. I put a portion of it on a paper plate to avoid any choking hazards and then repeat until he has eaten the carrot and other pieces of veggies. As an example, tonight's feast was the aforementioned carrot, 3 stalks of neglected asparagus, and 4 or 5 blueberries that I had gotten for my lunches for work.I ordered the supplies for a foraging mat to add another level to the nightly snacking, but I don't know how I feel about it anymore. My boyfriend says it's okay, but I feel kind of bad sneaking around like this when his parents have so kindly housed me at no cost to me during the pandemic. And now, I have actively spent money on the routine. So...AITA for blatantly going against his owner's wishes?",49,39,2020-07-15 04:42:53
927,YTA,AITA For walking around naked in my house?,"Obligatory ""I'm on mobile, so excuse my spelling or weird format.""I am a 21 y/o female and my wife is 23. We just purchased our first home and moved in about a week ago. Our kitchen window has no curtains or blinds, nor does it have any fixture to which one could attach a window covering to. That window overlooks our backyard and, if they wanted to, our neighbors could hypothetically look in to our window. So, our home has no air conditioning and we are in somewhat of a heat wave for my region. It's hot as balls and our pedestal fans just are not cutting it, so when I'm walking around and unpacking boxes, washing dishes, just... doing anything even remotely physical, I prefer to do so au naturel. That is to say, I like walking around naked in the heat. Before this, we lived in my parents' air conditioned home so I didn't really walk about nude, but since moving in it's become a bit of a point of contention with my wife and I. The neighbors do have children, and like I said the children could hypothetically look into the window if they so desired. My thought is, it's my damn house and if they don't want to see anything, they shouldn't look into other people's windows. My wife says that I shouldn't (just because of the neighbors, she likes seeing me naked lol), and my mother has even said that doing so would be abusive to the neighbors' children??? Honestly, I don't get the issue. So, Reddit, AITA?Edit for clarification: When I say the window has no fixture I literally mean when we moved in, there was no curtain rod or fixture for blinds. I didn't mean to say there was no way to install one. I'm not opposed to getting curtains at all, we just haven't as of yet as there are more important things we need to spend our money on. Let me also note that I'm not constantly standing in front of that particular window, but occasionally walking past it whilst doing other things.",17,59,2020-07-14 06:41:49

Every day I come home to a trashed house. My wife claims that she cleans but the house is filthy every day. I do all the dishes, do all the laundry, take out the trash, do all the cooking, etc etc. I dont know what the hell is wrong with her but she flat out refuses to do almost anything. She doesnt even do anything with the kids when she is home all day they just watch Disney+ or Netflix. It is too hot for her to go outside. Im just fucking sick of being responsible for every little thing it didnt used to be this way she has slowly regressed over a period of 3-4 years. Everything came to a head this morning when I told her I cant do it all all the time and she needs to stop leeching off me. I told her to get her shit together or get out of the house I pay for.

I gave them a deadline to move out because I cant take this anymore. They got into a massive fight the other day while my wife was out. I guess a pair of my wifes underwear got in with their laundry and she thought he was cheating. I think the fact she immediately jumped to cheating shows how bad their relationship is.She was waving the underwear around and I recognized them because they had a floral print but I just let this ridiculous fight go on. My wife came home after about thirty minutes and said they were hers. My wife asked if I didnt realize they were hers and I accidentally laughed.My daughter burst into tears and wont talk to me.

513,NTA,"AITA I came into a large amount of money, and now everyone is asking me for money. Im gonna block everyone","I came into $15,000 recently, which is a lot of money for me at the moment (Im 27/F and didn't finish college, although pre-covid I did have a decently paying job). My family and friends are all quite poor and have no savings. My dad asked me for $250 to help pay a bill, and he said he would pay me back. I said no that's fine, you don't have to pay me back, its no big deal and I'm happy to help. I told my dad that I got $5000 and not $15,000 because I didn't want him to hit me up for money all the time, although I don't mind helping when I can. I told my brother's ex wife (who I'm very close with even after their divorce, she comes and brings the kids and sees me and we have fun together) I told her that I got $2000 (again I lied because I didn't want her to hit me up for money all the time, I just helped her with groceries last month which was fine but I really can't afford to be helping everyone all the tim). I told her I got $2000 and that I was excited because I can finally buy another car (I haven't had one in years). She asked me an hour later if she can have some of it because its hard being a single mom and any little bit helps (my brother is a deadbeat dad, drug addict, etc) she said if I can even just give her $200 that would help. So I sent her $200 on western union yesterday. So then, last night I was on Facebook and unwinding, having a few drinks, and one of my oldest and closest friends (gay male, 30y/o) messaged me and said what's up. I said not much how have you been, Im just having some drinks. I told him I got $5000 and Im gonna get a car with it. He said he hasn't gotten paid yet and can he borrow some money, I said yea but Im spending the whole thing on the car and bills, I said I could send him $30 and so I did and he said thanks, but here I am just thinking, what the fuck? I mean I really don't mind helping but its just a weird feeling......I know that in the scheme of things, this isn't much of my money. $250 for my dad, $200 for my sister in law, and $30 to my friend, so that's only $480 total of my $15,000, but still, I haven't even bought myself anything with the money yet. I was planning on saving it. Im not gonna tell anyone else about the money, and if anyone hits me up for money, Im just gonna ignore them for a few weeks. But now I feel guilty. I don't want to lose the people I care about over such a small amount of money, I just feel.......used? Not used, just, I don't know I can't explain the feeling. WIBTA if I just ignored everyone for a few weeks? Am I the asshole for this, or are they the asshole for hitting me up? Or are none of us assholes and Im just paranoid? Thank you so much EDIT - PLEASE READ MY EDIT: The reason I told everyone about the money is because I received it from unemployment after losing my job to covid. I lost my job months ago, but I only found out about this program two weeks ago, and I was immediately approved and got the money in less than a week. I told them so that they can apply and see if they qualify. My dad and gay friend were approved, my sister in law wasnt. But regardless they still all hit me up for money",108,64,2020-07-15 20:21:24

149,NTA,AITA for slamming the door in my SILs face?,"My SIL, well call her Emma, is married to a huge dick named Dan. To give you an idea of what hes like: hes cheated on Emma with 4 different girls in the past 2 years and has made several embarrassing or demeaning comments about Emma in front of us. Weve tried talking to Emma about him multiple times and remind her often that she can always stay with us if she feels unsafe, but she brushes us off and denies everything. A couple of weeks ago, we (Emma, Dan, me, wife, and our 2 kids 9f and 5m) were eating dinner together at my house. My son accidentally dropped a plate and broke it. We didnt think it was that big of a deal but Dan started yelling at my son and telling him that he was a worthless, useless little shit. I had to step between them to get him to stop and by then I was seeing red. I told Dan to get the fuck out of my house and that if he came back Id call the police on him for trespassing. Then I told Emma that she was welcome to come back anytime as long as Dan was not with her. They both left immediately. Well, weve been worried about Emma since then so we decided to invite her over for dinner again. We reminded her that Dan was not welcome and she said that she understood. Yesterday, doorbell rings around when Emma said shes be at our house and I answer it. Emma and Dan are standing there on our porch. I said out loud for fucks sake and slammed the door on them. Wife heard and came out after a couple of minutes to try and get them to stay but they had already driven off. Wife is pissed because she thinks I should be more understanding because Emma is going through a lot and its not easy to leave an abusive relationship. Kids are devastated because they love their aunt and dont know why they cant see her. My son is convinced its his fault even though weve told him that it isnt. I just cant justify continuing to expose my children to that kind of behavior. I know that Emma is suffering but I need to protect my children first. AITA?",1901,160,2020-07-13 15:01:17
12,NTA,AITA for refusing to cook for my teenage kids?,"I am a single mom to my two kids Jenny (15) and Mark (17). They are good kids and I love them to death but they have both adopted very specific diets. It started with Mark getting into weight lifting/body building last year.He is on a cut right now and is dieting like crazy. He gave me a list of approved foods for his diet and its basically just chicken, broccoli, brown rice, tuna, lentils, potatoes. There a couple more veggies that Im allowed to cook with but thats basically it.Mark was a really chubby kid and I know the body building was a huge turning point for him so I want to support him. I was cooking two meals for the family every night, one for him and one for Jenny and I. It was a bit stressful but I was managing.About a month ago Jenny told me she was going vegan. This is something she wants to do for ethical and environmental reasons and I support her. She gave me a book of vegan recipes to use.Making a full vegan meal for one kid and a body building meal for the other takes 2 hours minimum if you include planning, prep, cooking and cleaning. The ingredients for these diets are pricey so our grocery bills have skyrocketed. Marks hates spice, Jenny loves spice. Jenny hates lentils and broccoli so I cant even try to combines some of their mealsBoth kids hate cooking and refuse to help. They make their own breakfast but not lunch so I have to portion their dinners so they can bring leftovers.Yesterday I was just exhausted and just didnt want to cook. I told the kids to order takeout when I went to take a nap. Well I woke up from my nap to two pissed off kids.Both of them were giving me shit for not cooking; Mark bitching takeout food is too greasy, Jenny bitching there werent any vegan restaurants in our area.Something inside me broke. I just started crying and told them both they were on their own from now on. I would buy the groceries but I wasnt cooking another damn meal.Jenny called me a shit mom and ran off to her room and Mark just rolled his eyes at me.Neither kid is talking to me right now and I just feel like shit. I wanna support my kids in whatever they do. At the same time, I just cant cook anymore. My whole life is just work, cook, sleep.Am I an asshole? Are my kids right, am I a shit mom?tldr: Both my kids have specific diets and want me to cook for them. I am tired of it and am going on a cooking strike.EDIT: I honestly cant believe the amount of comments I am getting. I just logged in after making the post this morning and I am just overwhelmed.Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the support. I am sobbing right now.With regards to my kids. Please know that they are really wonderful kids that are going though a rough time and not dealing with it the right way.  Their father hurt them, and is still hurting them, deeply. I am saving up to afford therapy for them. Hopefully in a couple months I can get them into a session.I grew up in a household where my mom was superwoman... just did it all with a smile. I wanted to be that for my kids. After my ex husband left us, I tried to hold onto it.I see now that I just did them a huge disservice. I will be strong in this and they will learn to fend for themselves, one way or another. I am receiving a lot of great advice and I take it to heart.",18220,3315,2020-07-09 21:09:13

I am still waiting for the confirmation and don't have much information.When I told him he went furious, he said he was ""humiliated"" (he was looking forward to see me and told everyone around him), disappointed and he also told me that my behavior was disgusting.

I had hopes and now you are breaking your promises"".While I understand the deception, we're also talking about my future. I have almost acheived five years of hard studying and the only way to finally get my diploma is to pass my exams. It was totally unexpected and when I got my ticket I was sincerely ready to come. I feel guilty, not because he's disabled but because I am breaking my promises. Now he says he's completely depressed and he told me I broke his heart.I don't know what to think. He's a sweet guy.

We always spoke and everything was fine until this conversation. So I knew her background as a first generation immigrant and didnt really care. One day we were having a conversation about student loans and she told me she didnt have any because she got a full ride. I told her I wasnt surprised as shes very smart.She made a comment about how hard it was applying for financial aid for the first time and I told her I had my mom help me. She then said that neither of her parents speak English so she had to do it by herself. I told her in my opinion its very impressive to have accomplish all the things shes had in her academic and corporate career with literally no help from her parents. I guess she took this the wrong way because she said they have helped her in tremendous ways and have sacrificed a lot for her and her siblings escaping a war torn country. I told her of course I didnt mean they didnt help her in life in general, but they cant help her with homework or things like that and theyre all her accomplishments. I thought we were having a positive conversation her later I found out shes telling people I make her feel uncomfortable and now Im being labeled a racist. Aita?!",28,46,2020-07-15 17:36:25

She never showers immediately. Thats a personal choice. The problem is that for days afterwards when you sit where she was sitting or attempt to use the blanket she did, it smells like straight BO. IMO if shes not going to be hygienic and shower afterwards, she shouldnt be allowed to be on the couch. Obviously, Im not talking about sitting down to take her shoes off or anything, I mean for a decent amount of time. If she wants to lay or sit on her bed and blankets and they smell like BO, fine, go ahead. I just dont think its fair that we all have to sit somewhere that is covered in her dry sweat and odors. Its a shared space. I think I may be the asshole for asking her because it might come off as bossy or over controlling. Im worried its not actually a big enough deal to bring up.

417,YTA,"AITA for not doing my cousin ILs wedding makeup as I was sick, but still going to the wedding?","So this happened a few years ago, but I saw a post that reminded me about this and it made me think if I was the AH.I (30f) was asked by my partners cousins Fianc to do her makeup for her wedding (I did a course in makeup artistry when I was 16 and never finished it because it wasnt my thing and I also had chronic health issues that made it hard to go to class every day). Anyway this woman asked me if I could do her makeup, and in return she would buy a piece of my art. (I was a bit weirded out by this part and should have seen a red flag there...) anyway I told her I dont really do it but she was persistent so I said ok. Also - I have a chronic illness that strikes at any time and effects my energy, and causes pain. (Everyone in his family knows this). I can still do some stuff but i have limitations and have to sort of conserve my energy. We had family staying with us and it started to really drain me and i started to have a flare up. Sadly I had to message her and tell her that I couldnt do her makeup as I was feeling really lousy.. I wanted to go to the wedding though as it was Thier special and I didnt want to miss it. I ended up going to the wedding and she ignored me and was super cold towards me when she talked with my partner. Anyway we left early as I wasnt well and needed to rest so we said goodbye, and  I could tell she was pissed (it looks could kill) even if she didnt say anything. She never said anything to me but my partner and I used to go out with them a few times a year but that flat out stopped after the wedding and now every time I have seen her since she has been icy as hell and doesnt want to talk to me.Maybe Im being paranoid or overthinking it... but as Ive had major surgeries in the past and she knows I have a severe chronic illness, that she might have a backup plan. Also she never wanted a practice makeup or anything and had never seen any makeup I had done except on myself so she was kinda taking a big risk there too.Also a big note she is a super money conscious and thrifty person even though she and her husband makes a really good salary. But I was ok for doing it for free because its family.. What do yall think? AITA?Edit: ok I see I am prob the AH, I did apologise profusely before and after the wedding...

Mom, theyre 9 and 10, almost 10 and 11. I shouldnt have to be looking after them anymore. They should be able to make a sandwich or something then behave around the house. I dont want to miss ANOTHER school play because of that!!Me: Theyve already shown not to be responsible.Molly: So teach them!! Make a checklist. Check in which them every half hour or something. Theyre old enough, mom. Im tired of being a babysitter. They sit around and watch TV anyway, so whats the point of being home early?I eventually just got angry with her and sent her to her room. Molly reluctantly obeyed. When my husband(36M) came home from work, I allowed her to come out, but she wont. Shes locked herself in and doesnt want to talk to anyone. My husband noticed she wasnt greeting him at the door right away. When he asked, I told him what happened, and he took her side. My husband says it isnt Mollys fault the little ones cant keep track of their damn heads if they werent attached, and that we should teach them how to look after themselves and set ground rules. I disagreed. My husband went to talk to Molly, now that she allowed him in. AITA?&#x200B;Edit: I have read all the replies, and I now know I am in the wrong. Ill go apologise to Molly and my husband and allow her in the play. I will also start teaching the other two how to act when Im not home. Thank you for your judgement.",5346,1368,2020-07-13 06:28:29
432,ESH,AITA for telling a friend of mine not to give my wife his business after she insulted me?,"Earlier this year my wife started her own design business. It has been a dream of hers for some time. She automatically assumed I would help her with legal documents (drafting, review), but no big deal. I was happy to do it even though I already have a full time job that takes up a lot of my time and it required some extra research on my part. Because this was not my regular job, sometimes I had to put work for her on the back burner. Any reasonable person should be able to understand this, I think, but not my wife. She felt entitled to be 1st priority even though I explained to her that I had to prioritize the job that was actually paying our bills, which only upset her more. We had several argument about this, and during one of them she accused me of being lazy. She said that my job is easy and anyone could do it. I just didn't want to help her because I didn't believe in her, never mind that I'd been spending my free nights and weekends doing work for her. That upset me so I told her I was done. If she wanted someone to review her legal documents then she should find a local firm and hire them. That upset her too because her margins were already thin, so the extra expense didn't help. And she didn't mind letting me know how she felt about that decision. A friend of mine was recently looking for someone to do some interior design work for him. He had already talked to my wife, but I told him that if I was in his position I would use someone more established and who wasn't a wreck 24/7 (basically told him about our fights and that based on how she'd treated me lately I questioned her mental fitness to do a project like his). He was surprised by that but decided to take my advice and go with someone else.When my wife asked me to help her talk to him, I told her no because I'd already told him not to use her. This became another big fight, and we are still fighting about it. She told me that this could have been a big step forward for her business and because of what I did it may mean she doesn't make it. I don't know if that is true or not, but I stand by my advice to him. She is an emotional wreck and in no frame of mind to help anyone. AITA?",145,155,2020-07-15 05:22:57
474,YTA,AITA for not wanting my stepdaughter to come around after she said she didnt want to spend time with my wife,"Long story short, my wife is sick. Not deathly Ill but recovering for 12 weeks. She called her 15 year old daughter and told her that she could be here more now that shes recovering. My wife asked if she was excited. My stepdaughter said not really. My wife was crying terribly after this. Now the story has changed and my stepdaughter all of a sudden wants to stay longer because her dad told her she was wrong and forced her to apologize.My wife wants her to come over for longer again but I do not. I think she needs to learn her lesson and stay for the short time she really wanted to stay for because she will just act like a brat because truth is she doesnt want to be here and why make everyone miserable and force time on her if she doesnt want to be here?We have a Florida vacation coming up and my step daughter is supposed to be going. It will be a 2 week vacation and thats a long time. I dont think she should be able to go because she doesnt want to be here any other time, why should she reap the benefits of a vacation Im paying for when she treats her mother like shit and doesnt want to be here during the times we are not having fun, but a vacation benefits her so of course she wants to be there for that. So, am I the asshole???",107,112,2020-07-14 01:00:45
895,NTA,AITA for staying out late?,"I (24F) came home around 3:30 am after going out and hanging with my friend for the day for my birthday and got in a huge fight with my mom over this. I told her around 4 pm I would be going and staying out late probably until 12 or 1 am. She gave the usual speech: dont go, have them come over here, come home early, I cant sleep when youre not in the house, etc. I told her I would check in at 9 and call at 12 to let her know if Im coming home yet or not. Well, come 9 I completely forgot to text her and ended up checking my phone around 10:30 and found 9 missed calls! I text her back saying Im safe and still out. This is where things went south. She then proceeds to call and text me every hour yelling at me to come home, that I dont love her, that Im raising her blood pressure and I want to kill her. I try to stay in touch but honestly lost my patience and ignored her calls and forgot to call her at 12 because I put my phone away. I dropped off my friend who lives almost an hour away and around 3 am she calls and I answer telling her I am driving and will be home soon. She calls 5 more times and when I get home and let her know Im sorry she cursed me out and literally kicked me to get out of her room. I go use the bathroom and she then bursts in to yell some more about how I dont care and Im killing her and acting hysterical complaining about chest pain and SOB. Thing is she does have high blood pressure so her acting that way and saying that made me anxious so I asked if she was feeling chest pain if she needed to go to the hospital. She told me to fuck off so I reached out and asked again more seriously and she collapsed on the floor which made me freak out even more and called for my brother who was sleeping. He comes in she is now too weak to yell and he helps her downstairs. My moms heart health has been a concern but she is very reluctant on going to the doctor. My brother told me I was TA for putting my mom through this when I know it will stress her out and raise her BP. I told him its unfair of her to want me to come home at 10pm for no reason just because she wants me home and she gets mad the few times I do go out regardless, no matter how late. He said if Im not willing to compromise I need to just take her yelling more gracefully, I told him its very hard for me as a person to lay down and take getting yelled out when I dont think I did anything wrong. He then said if she dies it will be my fault and he will never forgive me and I would loss a mother and a brother. This has been an ongoing issue between me and my family and at first I thought I was right but now Im not sure. AITA for staying out late?",19,23,2020-07-09 13:29:25
501,NAH,WIBTA for reporting my upstairs neighbors for smoking pot?,"Throwaway account.I own a business in a state where weed is not legal. Recently some new tenants moved into the apartments above my store and since they have moved in, most mornings when I come to work my store smells like pot. I have no problem with people who smoke pot, I've been around it many times at parties, and normally I don't care about it. I personally don't smoke but that's just my preference. The only reason I care is because I don't want my business to smell like pot. Air fresheners do not always cut it.I want to mention this to my landlord so that they stop. Here's the kicker - the apartments above my store are rented by the Department of Corrections (might be DOJ) and the people living there are either recently released from jail/prison or on parole. I do not plan on reporting it to the police, just my landlord. What he does is up to him.WIBTA for reporting their pot smoking?Edit: I have not spoken to the new tenants about it.

274,NTA,AITA for telling my MIL her genes aren't the only ones that matter?,"Everything I ever heard out of this woman was about the ""Boren Clan"" and how she's a ""Proud Boren."" Forget that she got married and took her husband's name, and her kids have the husband's name. It's all about the Boren clan.So, when I had my kid, all I heard from her was this and that trait are from the ""Boren Clan."" It wasn't ""Oh, look, THIS, just like dad"" or ""THIS, just like mom."" It was ""THIS, just like a Boren. The baby is a true BOREN."" Anything that was not ""Boren"" she was confused on, because ""That's not on my side."" She would literally say ""That's strange. I've never seen a Boren with freckles. Where could they have gotten that from?"" My response of ""Some in my side of the family have freckles,"" was met with ""Really? That is weird. Boren's don't have freckles."" I don't know if she's playing stupid or is genuinely confused on how genes work.This has been going on for years and I kind of lost it this weekend. I essentially told her last time I checked, a child has two sets of genes: one from the mother and one from the father. But if she wanted to throw the grandparents, then there would be 4 sets of genes fighting for dominance. But at the end of the day the genes that matter are SO and MINE, and she needs to stop making it sound like my genes don't exist.My SO found out and said I was mean in my response. But was I?

343,YTA,AITA for giving more money to my child with grandkids than my other child?,"I'm 52 and a mom of two adult children. I raised my two kids, Mike and June by myself almost their entire lives. Mike is 31 and June is 29.  Mike has three children whereas June isn't interested in having children. I was lucky to always work in the family business so we didn't struggle as much as other single parent households do. My dad passed when my kids were in their early 20s and left behind a considerable amount of money to me. My daughter-in-law and I are very close so I see a lot of Mike's children. They're angels and I love to play the doting grandma role. My daughter-in-law's mother passed away so it means a lot to her that the kids are close to the one grandma they have. Mike & his wife aren't in a terrible financial position, they're just two 30-somethings raising 3 kids so there isn't a lot of money to throw around. It makes my heart happy to give Mike & his wife money that is intended towards the children. Nothing incredibly extravagant, just small things like paying for skating class, gymnastics class, season passes to the amusement park (unfortunately not this year), new bikes. I always talk to Mike & my daughter-in-law first and if they're okay with it, I love to spoil the grandchildren.This was never a secret to June but also wasn't something I wanted to outright mention, I didn't want to seem like I was shaming Mike and his family. But when June found out she was VERY unhappy with it. She said it's unfair that I give more money to Mike & his family than I do to her. She said she doesn't necessarily want money or gifts but she wants things to be 50/50 with her and her brother. The argument that has really driven a wedge between my kids is that I favor Mike by giving him more money. I've pointed out that it's not like I'm gifting Mike a brand new TV for himself or anything like that. On birthdays/Xmas, Mike & June get similarly valued gifts. But she feels it's unfair that thousands more go to Mike's family over hers.",285,174,2020-07-12 05:06:46
578,YTA,AITA for getting relative nice old man fired?,"Okay this happened awhile ago but Im thinking about using it in job interviews as a time I had conflict with a colleague. Also old man is a bit mean, he was middle aged but drank and smoked so he could of been younger than what I remembered.So I (at the time 18 f) was a shipping clerk for a agriculture company, my job was to coordinate with lift driver to make sure they put the right crates on the right trucks. At the job there was only one person who was licensed to drive the big fork lift (it can pick up 4 crates instead of two), he was the main person I talked to. Lets call him Kevin. Kev was really cool, like a fun uncle type. Always down for a convo, always nice and ready to get work down. He did mess up quite a bit and I had to make him fix his mistakes. He was always okay with it since he knew that was my job. Other than being unprofessional he was a nice dude. Also worked for the company for 8+years.Anyway, one day he was getting crates down for me from the top of the stacks. Backing up to put on truck. I look down to my papers then BOMB. about 5 meters away, Kev had smashed into a small lift driver. This guy (call him Tim) was a new guy with long blonde dreadlocks. Never smiled. Never talked to anyone else. The site was a mess. Both vehicles were in pretty bad shape but the small lift was done for. A piece if its rear landed pretty close to me. And the whole area (very large warehouse) filled with smoke. We had to stop and I filled out a accident report as a was the only witness. I wrote what I saw. Kev didnt look behind him.While I was writing it Kev came up to me and said you saw what happened right? Tim shouldnt of been their in the first place. What an idiot. Everyone knows that. Granted hes right. Tim shouldnt of been there. Thats not what I wrote Though. I feel like if I had maybe I could of changed the outcome. So what happened was they both were tested for marijuana Tim came back positive and he was fired. Kevs was negative but he was suspended because of my statement. Was I the asshole for only writing that Kev didnt look behind him?Edit: I wrote everything I saw. It was a good 200-300 word paragraph. Guys I was very detailed. I just left out the part that Tim shouldnt of been there as he technically can be. Its known around the warehouse not to get behind Kev as he does mess up. Thats something I figured out not taught. Tim was new and didnt talk to anyone. I didnt want to put anything in that was opinion based. But Im thinking Im the asshole here as if I put more of a twist on Tim being the blazed out guy and Kev as completely innocent he would still have a job... Im questioning the words a choice I guess.",56,45,2020-07-11 14:03:22

The first time they got caught he had ran off because they weren't watching him and my sister's dog went with him to protect him. I got a call saying he had been missing for ""quite a while"" by my sister and asked to help find him. I spent an hour looking around town. Turns out I didn't need to. He had been in police custody for almost 3 hours before they finally decided to call and report him missing. The cops showed up and told her that they were going to take him to cps(child protective services). They launched an investigation and asked me about what had happened, when I became involved, and anything else that could be pertinent to a cps investigation. My niece blamed my sister and told her that she should have chased him down (2 days after having knee surgery). I told them everything; how they dump him on my sister all the time (even after she just had knee replacement surgery . . . Twice), how they had bedbugs, how when she takes him somewhere she doesn't leave proper diapers and supplies, how he gets out all the time, how they sleep in my sister's garage while he sleeps in the house with my sister because they don't want to deal with him . . . I had about a page and 3/4 another of complaints about their parentage. Two weeks later he got out again and cps took him for the second time.

Since then, she has worked numerous part time jobs, but always has a problem with those jobs and quits.  Around the house, she either refuses to do any work, or has to be told numerous times to do a chore.  Her go to excuse for not doing chores is that she works and is too busy.

And now she believes I have it . I was pretty furious since she had forbidden to go my therapist for almost half a year and continued to call me an attention seeker whenever I braught it up .

829,YTA,WIBTA if my mom lost her job because of me?,"My fianc and I have been living with my parents for the past few years, to save money for a down payment on a house and his work is nearby. He does pay rent, $250 a month and helps pay groceries here and there, errands, etc. I do not pay rent(per their request), however, I do pay the yearly sewage bill.My fianc likes to pay in a lump sum(example, he will pay rent for 6 months up front) So rent for the 6 months is coming up. However, my parents said they raised the rent to $450 a month and that they told me before (I don't recall this) to tell him this. No explanation to why they raised the rent. I did not agree to this sudden jump in rent, and told my fianc the new rent amount.He said he'd pay it, but I suggested to him to move out soon and live with his grandfather's basement rent free to save money. The reason why he didn't do this to start was because my fiance works overnight in a hospital cleaning patient room(including Covid-19 rooms) and since his grandfather is at risk of getting sick easily, he didn't want to take a chance of getting his grandfather sick. His parents live an hour away, so that was out of the question as well.If my fianc moves out to his grandfathers, he would take care of him from when the morning caretaker leaves(5pm), until he goes to work at 11pm. Here is where lies the 'dilemma'.My mother is his grandfather's caretaker at night, from 5pm to 10pm and gets paid well. This is her second job, and is more of an extra cash, and she does love him like he was her own father. If he moves out, they wouldn't need her anymore since he'd be doing her job. I told my fiance this and he felt bad he could be costing her a job, but I told him it's not his fault since they raised the rent so suddenly without even talking to him. He felt hurt that they didn't talk to him directly.He said he will think about it, but I will be telling my mom what is going to happen if the rent is getting increased. He said he didn't mind an increase had they talked to him directly versus me. He is a pretty friendly guy, and understanding about situations changing, and has a great relationship with my parents, so it's not like they couldn't talk to him.I said for now, to pay the new monthly rent, and I'll split it with him, but to no longer offer to pay for groceries or errands if they can't be direct with him. He doesn't like that idea either, and said it seems spiteful. I know $450 a month isn't much, compared to actually renting an apartment or paying a monthly mortage, but it's the way they went about it is what makes me feel mad and spiteful.If he does go through with it, she will lose her night job as his grandfather's caretaker(I think she makes roughly 1500 a month, 25 hours a week) and it would be because of my idea to him. She has her main job, but currently due to Covid-19, is furloughed until the beginning of August. I just want to give her a heads up as it could likely happen.",22,35,2020-07-13 06:16:42

Normally, what happens is that I find it, recoil in horror, then flush the toilet. This is a daily fucking thing.It happens to be very hot right now, and I had worked all day, so I came home to rest.

507,NTA,AITA for telling a family friend that I had an abnormal university experience?,"Throwaway, on mobile, yadda yadda. Disclaimer for you Americans: I live in the UK, where we dont have roommates. Instead we have flatmates (normally 4-6 people to a flat) where everyone has their own bedroom & bathroom and a shared kitchen/living room. I (F20) am about to start my 3rd year of university. My mums friends daughter Leah is 18 and starting university this September. Now, almost everyone will probably have had a nightmare flatmate at some point - all of my friends had. I, however, lucked out. All 5 of my flatmates in my first year were amazing and we were very compatible despite being randomly assigned. We made the decision at the end of first year to keep living together, and have done the same this year. My moms friend wanted me to talk to Leah about university and the flatmate-situation, because she knows that I got along really well with my flatmates. Well, when it came to it, I gently let Leah know that she shouldnt have the same expectations of her flatmates as mine. My words exactly were: With 5 strangers, its pretty likely that you wont get on with at least one of them. Among them, youll probably find a great friend and you undoubtedly will enjoy your time at university, but dont expect to make five best friends out of your flatmates. Seriously, Ive heard of some psycho flatmate stories from friends, and I wanted to give Leah some sincere advice as well as reassuring her. Leah seemed to take it well, but she seemed kinda taken aback by me saying that she wont make best friends with them all. We had a good talk about some of the realities of uni, as well as some of the enjoyable parts, and she went home. I thought Id actually done really well on talking to her, and she understood me pretty well. But, Im sure you can see where this is going. Leahs mum called me later in the evening to tell me that Id made Leah cry and broken her heart about her flatmates. I was literally astonished. I didnt say it aloud, but I was kind of shocked that someone as intelligent and headstrong as Leah really thought shed become best friends with 5 randomly assigned strangers, especially considering that she seemed to understand when I told her. Im kind of in two minds about this - should I have let Leah believe shes going to be in the same predicament as me or is it good that I gave her a reality check? AITA?",80,82,2020-07-14 00:29:01

After we were done I went to take a nap, I do a biphasic sleep schedule. In the meantime they went over to my partner's sister's to see her. All great so far.Next my MIL's friend drops off the most adorable six week old kitten. We spent about an hour together, him trying to get acquainted with the new environment and myself just in awe. He trusted me very quickly and would meow at me to follow him so he feels safe exploring.My partner and her mom come back home and bring her sister (31F) and her two kids (3 & 7). Instantly the kitten is terrified and the kids are all over him -- completely understandable, he's too cute. I asked them to be gentle please because he's little and went to get some food for the kitten.I was a bit worried because these kids are very far from disciplined and I've had to stop them from being too rough with my adult cats before. Anyways I come back, put the food down, and walk to the bedroom where the kids and the kitten are.I see the younger one shoving the kitten forcefully into one of those Kitty huts -- the kitten was terrified trying to get out, meowing desperately. The kid shoves him back in and forcefully tries to close the hole so it can't get out. My instant reaction was ""Hey! Don't do that to the kitten, he doesn't want to be in there."" At this point only the ""hey"" was stern.He smiled at me and ignored me, doing it again. So at this point I sternly told him ""I said stop. You're scaring and hurting the kitten."" He finally stopped and told me ""I wanted him to go in the house.""So at this point I completely drop the stern voice and tell him ""then you have to be gentle with him, he's small -- like you.""His mom comes out of the bathroom already pissed saying ""you didn't have to give him that ATTITUDE.""Now this is where I dropped the ball hardcore... Maybe it was having recently woken up, maybe it was being protective of the kitten, and maybe it was the previous history of the parents and how undisciplined I find these kids.Anyways without thinking I answered in a snarky tone ""well fuck... Who's going to then?""She went livid from 0 to 60 ""ex-fucking-cuse me? You don't talk to a child like that over a KITTEN.""Not gonna lie this made me livid also because I can't stand when people use ""it's just an animal"" to excuse humans (adult or children) from treating them horribly.I just said ""go fuck yourself"", albeit louder than I should have around kids, and walked out. So now in my partner's sister's eyes I'm the most horrid human being alive for being ""rude"" to the kid. Am I the Asshole?",138,40,2020-07-12 02:00:59
530,YTA,AITA for 'letting' the dog ruin my sister's room and destroy her stuff?,"So my dad found this little Jack Russell at a building he was planning to buy and brought him home to be ours (his). He's still untrained so he mostly stays outside and only comes inside if whoever brought him in keeps their eyes on him. This morning I was watching a movie in the living room with my sister when she got a call from her boyfriend and went outside. I continued watching the movie and only saw the dog when he was sniffing his way into my sister's room. I tried shooing him but that didn't work well since he doesn't have a name yet and isn't responsive, so I called my sister's name twice and she just hushed me with her hands and closed the door. I yelled once more that the dog was in her room but she mized so I gave up and continued watching the movie. About ten minutes later my sister comes back and starts screaming from her room. Turns out the dog fucked up her duvet, her bag, and a broke this sculpture thing she made last year. He also left the room in a mess but that was mostly cleanable. Now she's blaming me for watching the dog go in her room and not doing anything to stop him. I told her I called her but she's and mom are still maintaining that it's my fault. Dad's luckly on my side since I did warn her. AITA?",69,56,2020-07-12 20:37:52
359,YTA,AITA for exposing my pregnant daughter in law for who she is?,"My daughter in law has been using her pregnancy to release what she claims are pent up frustrations she has against me. She refuses all of my help and has isolated my son from me. For example, when I tell her that blueberries are good for the baby when she was eating fast food, my son asked why I kept giving her stuff that made her nauseous. Our breaking point was when I noticed her feet were longer and more swollen so I decided to gift her medical grade compression socks. She retaliated by calling me a  Karen to my son. My daughter in law before 19 lived in Bulgaria before coming here for college and grad school. She has since gotten a job in a tech firm. But I noticed that when she was in Bulgaria she dressed up with blackface for Halloween and it was still in an old Facebook album. So I forwarded it to my son and to her boss, who is African American. My son is furious and says this was inappropriate for me to dredge up. Meanwhile, my DIL has reached out to her boss but hes been ignoring her. Instead, somebody from their Human Resources department scheduled a call with her for around 4:50 this afternoon and asked her not to come in today. AITA for trying to get everybody to see the DIL that I see? Everybody has been ostracizing me during her smear campaign against me, and I just wanted to show them that she was insensitive and vindictive. Yet, Im not the only one whos angry at her, since she got messages from coworkers calling her the racist Bulgarian bitch and telling her HR is certainly calling to fire her.Edit 1: So my DIL was fired.",248,283,2020-07-10 16:22:50
512,NTA,AITA for singing alone in my house?,"I enjoy singing but I am VERY bad at it admittedly.  I have no pitch or tone but I like to sing alone in my room usually to songs or Ill even do karaoke by myself I know Im bad but I like doing it, its fun and a stress reliever I only do it by myself not in front of others. I moved in with an roommate a couple months ago and he hates my singing (I dont blame him) but I was singing in my room a few weeks after moving in and he had asked me to stop and not to do it when hes home, I said sure it seemed like a reasonable request. Well the other day I thought my roommate was out and was singing some karaoke in my room and didnt think hed be home for a couple of hours. He ended up coming back early with a couple of friends and they heard me singing (Id didnt hear them come in as I had headphones in). Well he actually sent them home and BLEW up on me saying that I embarrassed him with my terrible singing and that no one should be singing like that unless theyre a professional.  he also doesnt want me singing at all in the apartment. I apologized and said I didnt know that they would be home but hes still mad at me. But I dont really feel like TA here. What do you guys think AITA?",80,21,2020-07-10 21:34:32
655,YTA,AITA for insisting that my wife wont stand up for herself about her pay?,"So my wife works at a private childrens home, and is a full time employee, however, she is paid hourly, not salary. At her employer, full time is considered 50 hours. In my state, hourly employees who work over 40 hours a week must be paid time and a half on the hours over 40, however, my wifes employer says that full time there is 50 hours, and you only get paid for overtime for hours over 50. I think this is kinda ridiculous; the company doesnt get to determine whether the law applies to them. And I think people turn a blind eye because its a childrens home.I told my wife she should speak up about it; shes missing out on $100 weekly that she legally deserves, which comes out to a $5k increase annually (which would be the equivalent of a 10% raise). She doesnt want to speak up though because she is newer (4 months) and no one else does, so she doesnt want to be the new person who comes in and starts complaining about the way things are. But this is money we could really use right now.Lately shes told me that what she makes at work isnt my business and that I should let it go. I feel like this isnt true because we share finances. I have tried to see if she is having an issue with a manager or something that makes her not want to stand up for herself, but it doesnt seem that is the case. AITA?Edit: Thanks everyone for the input. I can see that I was being insensitive. I think Im just stressed out about our huge student loan debt, and Im focusing too much on the money.",38,71,2020-07-13 15:05:46
449,NAH,AITA for expecting my (16f) friend to pay for the materials for her birthday gift?,"I (16f) like to knit and my gifts to people are usually knitted items. Most gifts, are one or two skein projects like hats, cowls, or mittens so I cover the costs. The thing is, when I texted my friend Kate (not her real name) and asked her what she wanted for her birthday which is in a little over a month, she said that she wanted a sweater like the one that I had just knitted. I like Kate and consider her sweater worthy so I didnt have a problem with it, but the thing is that sweaters are pretty expensive and also, in my sweater, I had indulged in really fancy and expensive yarn (mohair). I told Kate that I would be happy to make her the sweater, but that she would have to pay for the materials. I also sent her a list of her choices between yarn depending on how much she wanted to spend. Kate got really mad over this and said that the entire point of gifts is that you purchase it for the person. That makes sense, but I would consider the gift all of the time and effort that I would put into her sweater especially since Im pretty slow knitter so if would be a lot of work to have it finished by her birthday. I explained that to Kate that if she wanted something smaller, Id pay for it, but that the sweater is out of what Im comfortable paying if since she isnt willing to have it in acrylic. That made her really upset. Im conflicted because on one hand, if I use significantly cheaper yarn, I could pay for it and it would still be basically within a reasonable amount to spend on a birthday present. But on the other hand, I feel like she would hate it bc she already made a big deal abt how she wants it in the same material as mine and wont rlly settle for less. So Reddit, what do you think? AITA?edit: typo**some clarifications***The sweater that I made that she wanted an identical one of was abt $150. If she had been willing to have her sweater in acrylic, I would have paid for it. She was not willing to have it in acrylic. So I wanted her to pay for it. The cheapest yarn she would have settled for was still and alpaca blend and she still wanted me to pay for it bc its a gift.",130,117,2020-07-10 08:38:24
669,NAH,AITA for considering spending our house deposit on a masters degree,"So I moved countries for my partner's job and since being here our goal was to save for a house. We're nowhere near our goal - we need about 80-100k and have saved 30k, as we had a baby last year and so my income took a hit. We're moving incredibly slowly toward that goal, say 1k a month, so its will take FOREVER to save that.Here's the problem - i HATE my job. Its dead end and not really what I want to do. I'm also really far from all my family who are back home, so feeling pretty shitty. What I do want to do requires a masters degree, but I can't get funding for it here as I'm not a citizen, meaning id have to pay upfront - about 30k. Essentially all our savings....  AITA for considering asking my partner if i can use it for a masters? I asked my partner if we can move back to my home country but he refuses until we have a house deposit. The other option is I could do part time and pay as I go, but meaning we won't save any more on top of that. We have a toddler, and the idea was to become slightly more financially stable for her - but I feel like I want a job I love more than a house!",41,19,2020-07-10 03:19:02
260,YTA,"WIBTA if I told our new roommate she's adapting to us, not the other way around?","Throwaway bc I saw my new roommate on reddit once. My \[23 m\] and my gf \[25 f\] got a new roommate at the beginning of the month \[25 f\]. She's nice and seems to like us, but is a clean freak. I don't think my gf and I are the dirty, but we're not obsessively clean either. When she first moved in we noticed some roaches and brought it up to the new roommate since we hadn't seen any before. She said she hadn't had a roach problem before, but would help. She cleaned bathroom, living room, and kitchen. We appreciated it, but since then has been cleaning a lot and seems to be frustrated with our cleanliness. These have been the following interactions:""make sure you wipe the counter and rinse the dishes and vacuum before going to bed so there's nothing for the roaches"" ""I'm fine with you eating on my coffee table, but could you clean up your dishes and wipe it down when you're done? there was a lot of sauce on the table and I stepped in a puddle of something on my rug"". I just... ugh I know it was messy and I spilled juice but I wanted to go for a surf and then clean it up after but she saw it before I came back home. Like, i even saw her once scrubbing the floor and asked what was wrong and she said there was a huge sticky patch but idk i feel like I would have noticed if there had been one. The other day she said there's a ton of ants all over our maple syrup and she was going to move it to the fridge and if there are ants there are roaches so we should be careful. Then yesterday, she said asked how we thought about a chore wheel and also mentioned to us that she had wiped poop of the toilet. My gf said it def wasn't her and i just feel like i would have known if it was me and maybe she's just saying it idk. &#x200B;I guess I'm just trying to figure out if she has unreasonable expectations or if I'm a dirtbag and don't realize it. but even if i were messy, we've lived here for a year and she just got on the lease so she needs to just get used to the way we are and we shouldn't have to clean extra just bc she likes it. so WIBTA if i told her this??",542,257,2020-07-14 00:47:35

His dad was married twice and has five children, and I'll admit it is kind of a tough group to break into but besides one sister, i love his family. Both of my children are very close to their cousins and we go a lot as a family. My son recently got engaged to his girlfriend of two years. We'll call her Jessica.Like I said they family can be a little hard to break into. His father was a big outdoors man and had this kind of creepy cabin in the woods and the first time I stayed there his siblings convinced me it was haunted. I'm not even that gullible so they went to great lengths there, scared the shit out of me while I was in the shower, and I ran out half naked and crying. After that things got much better and I genuinely love them.Jessica hasn't spend that much time around the family. My son goes to a lot of things without her, because she doesn't like big groups. Well we went camping recently with two of my husband's siblings and their children. I guess they wanted to initiate Jessica. Now after what was done to me this seems pretty mild, but they told her that my son was looking for her and that he seemed annoyed and he was in the clearing in the woods. When she went to look for him she got attacked with water guns/balloons.Jessica was very upset and cried. I did try to be sympathetic, but it happens to everyone and I don't feel like she was being unfairly targeted. I tried to comfort her a little, but then I told her that she really needs to get thicker skin because my son loves his family.

875,NTA,WIBTA if I end my side of the lease early?,"So! Im 18F and both of my roommates are 19 (one M, the other F) Weve all been friends for over 3 years, and decided to get a place together around 2 months ago! The place is beautiful and within our price ranges. My M roommate (lets call him Tommy) has a large crush on me and doesnt make it subtle. I knew this before we moved in, so thats not a problem. However, since we started living together, Tommy has been unbearable with his flirting. He comes into my room without knocking (no locks) and does it especially while Im sleeping. When Im under the influence of any drugs or alcohol, hes touchy and pushy. He doesnt let me leave to hang out with my boyfriend (we have 1 car, so he drives me) because he gets extremely jealous. Ive asked him to stop doing what hes doing and set a line. My other roommate (Bella) has told me shes uncomfortable sometimes too, but tells me its not that serious and I dont need to start anything over it, which I sort of agree with? The thing that set me over is that my friend who lives over 2,000 miles away got kicked out. We have an extra bedroom, so I said if he can get a way over, hes free to stay here. I talked this over with both Bella and Tommy, they were down. They like him, friend likes them. It all worked out. Yesterday, however, I bring up that friend is coming over in less than 2 weeks and Tommy gets really quiet. He says he doesnt want friend over because hes worried Im going to have sex with friend and Tommy tells me he doesnt want friend staying anymore. I lost my shit. Friend has already mailed his stuff over and has a plane ticket and his savings in his pocket. Weve been planning this for over 2 months. Why didnt he say anything before? So, I decided I want to cut my side of the lease early and move in with friend. Bella and Tommy can handle the place without my share, but theyll have to work more and harder. WIBTA if I left? TL;DR my roommate makes me uncomfortable and I dont know if its justified if I leave them alone to pay my side of the lease",20,22,2020-07-11 16:09:56
964,NAH,WIBTA If I told my stepdad that I don't see him as a father?,"The title sounds pretty harsh, so here goes.I am 24F, and I was already in university when my parents (51F, 56M) got divorced. My mom started dating a new guy, let's call him Craig, fairly soon after the divorce. My dad was obviously upset, but my mom wasn't happy for a long time and neither me or any of my siblings were upset that she started seeing someone so soon.Now, my mom has been visiting me at my apartment a lot more now that COVID restrictions are lifting in my area (not the US). Sometimes Craig joins her, sometimes he doesn't. I see him when I'm home for breaks or holidays, so often two or three times a year, so we've never really bonded. He's a great guy to my mom and my younger siblings, and he's nice enough. But also, I see my actual dad as often as I see my mom (except he's an essential worker right now, so he doesn't come to see me).The other day I was talking to my mom and Craig, and he just made a comment about loving all of his kids, and made it very clear that I was one of his kids as well since he had married my mom, and he wanted me to see him as a father figure. The thing is, I don't. He's a good guy and I'll treat him with respect and all, but I have a dad already and I don't see him as my father. And honestly, it makes me uncomfortable when he mentions being my dad, because he's not and I'm still really close with my real dad and I feel like this erases that.I'm glad he loves me as his child, but I want to tell him that I don't think of his as my father. Am I making too big of a deal of this? WIBTA to say something about it, or should I just let it go?TLDR: My parents got divorced and mom remarried. I'm still very close to my bio-dad, but my step-dad is very insistent that I also see him as a father.

224,NTA,WIBTA for telling my dad that hes petty for not eating the food my mom cooks,"My(15F) parents have constantly been fighting with each other for as long as I can remember. There are always threats of divorce being thrown at my mom(42f) by my dad(44m). The most recent interaction was two days ago, where my dad wanted me to go on a walk with him and my mom told him to take my sisters (ages 7 and 3) too because she was too tired to watch them (keep in mind she watches them all the time, and he works all day. this was during a weekend, for a less than one hour walk). My dad was furious and called her a bad mom for not being able to watch her children.  Yesterday my mom asked me what POS means. I told her it stands for piece of shit. She seemed taken aback at first and then went into the bathroom for a while and came out visibly looking as if she had been crying. I know for a fact that my dad must have texted her calling her a POS because he has a habit of sending lots of verbally abusive emails and texts to her after a fight. For a while, my dad hasnt been eating the food my mom cooks. He buys frozen meals from grocery stores and makes sure hes very loud while unwrapping and microwaving them. He doesnt even bother to hide it from his children. My sister (7F) asked me why her dad wont eat the food my mom cooks. I just told her hes on a diet because I didnt know what to say. my mom asks me to cook food sometimes so that he will actually eat the food prepared at home. I did that once but I honestly dont give a fuck anymore. He can go eat his nasty frozen meals and I wont do anything about it. However, my mom is obviously hurt about it. Today during dinner he kept trying to make conversation with me and I actively ignored him. I really wanted to tell him that hes petty and disrespectful for what hes doing. I cant make myself shut up so Im sitting in my room right now and I need someone to tell me if this is wrong. I hate the idea of my sisters seeing this shit from such a young age, and my mom feeling so hurt. Basically, WIBTA if I called my dad out for what hes doing?edit: the main reason I think I might be the asshole for saying this is that once, my parents were having a very big fight and my dad was repeatedly saying my mom belongs in hell and i couldnt stand it. I yelled shut up at him and he ignored me for days till i apologized, and he was still cold after it. I only apologized because my mom begged me to. But then seeing how upset my mom was that my dad didnt talk to me for so long, i kept myself quiet this time and avoided saying anything about the frozen meals thing. Thats why Im thinking I might be an asshole if I say anything, an asshole to my mom specifically. Also I was raised in a culture where respecting your elders is a big deal, so me telling him to shut up shook me after saying it. I couldnt even believe I had just said it to him. This is just some context for people who might think its super obviously NTA.edit 2: someone commented that my mom might not be innocent in all of this and I think the comment was deleted or I cant find it. Can anyone elaborate on what this means? Am I an asshole for taking my moms side without knowing everything??",768,144,2020-07-15 04:43:18

I settled in and was just about to fall asleep when our dog let out a panicked howl. I knew my husband wouldn't hear it with his gaming headset on, so I go down in my underwear and a t-shirt to check things out. It's almost always a neighbor who gets home from work late and their car door spooks the dog for some reason. I get downstairs, and there is my MIL standing IN MY HOUSE!!! Her first words are ""I think we need to talk about your behavior."" Que explosion from me. Here is a brief summary of what I remember saying:""What the #@$%?!?! Why are you here?! Why did you think it's ok to let yourself into our home without permission?! You need to get out now!!! You need to get outside now or I'm going to call the police!""She stammers a bit, flustered at my outburst, and then runs out crying. I get my husband and he is PISSED. This is a hard boundary line crossed as both my husband and I are private people and this IS known to them. We get outside with masks on to try and calm down and get to the bottom of it all. We have an emotional talk about how their choices have impacted their ability to see their grandchild and it finally appears to have sunk in, even though we have explained this to them before. Whatever, we kinda patch things up and she apologises. It seems sincere but still seemed to lack the understanding of the severity of the offense since she then asked me for an APOLOGY for threatening to call the cops. No, I'm not sorry. You broke into our house and my reaction was justified, or so I thought. She didn't push it after I ignored the comment completely and continued with the regular good bye pleasantries, but I am curious if that may have been an AH move.",3461,210,2020-07-14 15:43:08

My one party trick once I've had a few drinks is to lift people up and twirl them around. My GF loves it when I toss her around but as of late she's started to get annoyed that I'm touching other people. I was at the park with a few friends and throwing people around which included seeing if 3 people could stand on my shoulders and back. As we were drinking we quickly came tumbling down in laughter. One girl however seemed to really enjoy me lifting her up to the point she kept asking and asking. I was happy to oblige and always made sure I grabbed her by the waist or bridal style. We get drunker and suddenly she wants me to grab her in other places to lift her and wants me to grab her by the neck. I jokingly say ""I'll probably end up choking you"" and she replies she'd like that, I realise it's going too far and stop there. My GF wasn't happy as you can imagine.On the way home we get into an argument and she says I shouldn't be touching any one else apart from her and I'm causing drama in the group.

We do visit each other at least once a year. Since I've never made it to the UK in summer, I looked up flights and found a really good and cheap offer in August this morning. I've been wanting to visit him so much since he had Corona and following pneumonia in April and I was scared to death about him, and his lovely dog suddenly passed away end of June from a seizure, feeling I need to be with him because of his history of depression.I'm having a girlfriend for 4 weeks now.I do really like her. Early on she told me that she can't/won't fly because of her weight of 180kg / 28 Stone. (And I think anxiety too.)A couple of weeks ago she asked me about the time of my summer days off work and I told her (I've got 21 days off.) She said she has 14 days off in the same time and was happy we can see more often then. (We could see every day if we wanted, even while working because we live close by.) But no plans were made what to do or where to go during this time. So I forgot about it. I forget a lot, just saying.So this morning I'm talking days off with my best friend and he said I can come visit whenever I want. I immediately messaged my girlfriend and asked her ""If I find flights to England to visit my best friend in August, will you come with me?"" She replied ""Rather not, I'm too fat. Sorry."" And I said ""Don't worry, babe, soon we'll be able to travel together."" (Since she keeps talking about losing weight so she is more mobile and can live ""unhindered"" as she calls it.)So I booked 10 days vacation alone with my friend because it gave me the best value (lowest price and shortest travel and transfer time).Excitedly I messaged my girlfriend about it and she's been crying since, how much I hurt her deciding my flight times on my own without her.I was a bit surprised. I've asked her. No matter my flights, we still have 4 days in August or 6 days in September off at the same time (she still hasn't told me exactly when she has her days off)She's currently in day hospital for psychiatry (I don't exactly know yet for what reasons, since I'm still just getting to know her) I think because of her weight, eating disorder, depression, insecurities, I think.Don't get me wrong, I really like her. But I'm having a hard time understanding what hell of a mistake I made.No, I won't cancel the flight. No, I won't allow her obesity to keep me from living my life. It's already ruining her life :( TL;DR: Asked GF of 4 weeks if she wants to travel to best friend with me, she said no because she's too obese, I booked a flight during a time we're both off work and she's been crying since.",698,136,2020-07-15 16:46:54

Shes watching the kids between 10-20 hours a week. Recently I came back and it was time to pay her, but she was in the middle of bathing the kids so said Can you just put it in my purse? I said no problem. I went downstairs and found her purse but it was a little cluttered so I put it in her wallet in her purse so it would be easy to find and count. When I opened her wallet to put it inside, I couldnt help but see her ID in the transparent front pocket, and it had her photo but her name was completely different from the one she had given us and wed background checked when we had hired her. Shes been great, so I didnt want to just fire her, but this meant she was either using a fake name with us or carrying a fake ID, so we had to see if she was trying to hide something relevant. Shes someone who spends prolonged time alone with our kids. And as great as she seems to us, our kids cant really talk yet. So we can only know so much. My wife and I discussed it and decided to hire a private investigator to check into her, because whatever story she gave us if we confronted her, wed then take steps to verify it anyways. So it was best not to give her the opportunity to hide anything or backtrack. The PI discovered she had the ID to circumvent a bureaucratic rule about student living arrangements for the graduate school at her university (something like she wanted to stay on the undergraduate campus when she became a graduate student so used an undergrad friends name on her ID to register for housing.) Not a big deal. Then, unfortunately, unbeknownst to us our 3yo overheard us talking about it and said something that tipped her off to the whole thing. We explained that we had become aware, looked into it, but it was all fine now. She was *very* upset, said it was none of our business why she would have two IDs, and it was a violation of her privacy to look into her life instead of just asking her. Now shes even considering quitting. We feel awful, but are also weighing that with how awful wed feel if we didnt do due diligence and there was something serious to it. Were conflicted now, because she has always been wonderful. AITA for hiring the private investigator?Edit: The ID was (what appeared to be) a state issued drivers license.

The post used arguments that are true on their own, such as saying that you can do a mouth swab a get a full DNA copy, so they did not think the nose swab was necessary and that you should be able to screen for the virus with a cheek swab. And while this is true, this does not serve as an argument to say they must be implanting something. Me and my sister called her out on her post saying she shouldnt be posting this since its just to promote fear and that it will prevent people from getting tested. Which is the only way that the pandemic has managed to get under control in some countries by helping assess the appropriate measures. I also explained to her the reason for a nose swab was to get a more representative sample of your respiratory system and not only the virus that has been trapped by your mouth or nasal hairs. I shared a link showing all the different methods that people are developing to screen for the virus and highlighted that the nose swab is not the only one, but the most accurate at the moment. She went on to defend her post on the basis of previous information inconsistencies about the virus. I acknowledge that theres a lot of misinformation but posts like her just add to that. The Facebook discussion finished and I received a call from my mum whos been receiving calls from all the family saying that we had started a whole family drama. With some people supporting us and some people saying we were assholes for publicly calling her out. My mum ended calling my aunt, who cried saying that she never expected such betrayal from us and that we made her look dumb with her fb contacts, some of which called her up to say she was humiliating herself and was dumb. My aunt later sent us a Facebook photo saying something along the lines of if you dont like a post, dont comment, like or share, just carry on with your life and let everyone live theirsMy intention was never to insult her but to inform her and make people see how illogical these conspiracy theories are and to encourage critical thinking and reducing fake news. I believe people should not stay quiet in moments of discomfort and controversy. Maybe it would have been better to send her a private message saying she was being irrational, but at the moment I didnt think of that. I also think she should be responsible for what she posts and that Im not responsible of other people calling her dumb. So what do you think AITA?",22,19,2020-07-13 12:59:18
588,NAH,AITA if I don't co-sign for my brother,"So my little brother is going to college this yesr and after all the grants, scholarships and both loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) he still has 3k left to pay for his tuition. I got married so I'm on my own and I have a good credit score. My parents both got denied for the direct plus loan (for parents) and my older brother doesnt have good credit either. His college is fairly expensive. About 32-38K (he showed me his awards). He doesnt have a credit score and he doesnt work atm. Im his only option to co-sign but he could possibly borrow the 3k from my parents but they're looking for a house to buy. I'm not sure if I should co-sign for him because it could be risky. He's planning to go to college for 4 years and maybe some additional medical school (forgot the program he was in). Should I do it? Would i be the asshole if I dont?ETA: I forgot to clarify he needs an extra 3k each semester so for the 2 semesters he needs 6k in total.",51,37,2020-07-15 06:48:57
700,YTA,AITA for being mad about my roommate calling my dog a pet name?,"Using substitute names just in case, and using a throwaway because my roommates know my UN.Background: My roommate (Sara) and my boyfriend (Richard) used to date. After they ended things, we all remained pretty close.Richard had a dog (Bruno) before either relationship started. While Richard and I have been together the last two years, I've started calling Bruno my son, I call myself his 'mama', etc. More recently, however, Sara has started to use these same sort of pet names and such. I've talked to her about it making me uncomfortable, as it seems as though she's trying to reinsert herself into my relationship, but she brushed it aside saying that she takes care of him just as much as everyone else, and that he's just 'the house baby' so everyone is his mama.AITA for wishing she couldn't call him these sorts of things?Edit: Richard, Sara and I were all in a polyamorous relationship to begin with. It started with just Sara and I, but when we met him, we both fell for him, so we all agreed to start something there. They broke up after just a couple of weeks, as they found they just weren't compatible, and I stayed in the picture with Richard. I lived with him for about five months after his breakup with Sara, but due to some other circumstances, and the fact that we were all still pretty close, we all got a place together and have been living together for just over a year and a half.Edit2: It's not so much the fact that she's calling herself his mama, but that she was offended, and refused to stop when I asked her to. Richard also does not know that she is doing this, as she only does it when he is not home. He does, however, know that I do it, and he's never had a problem with it. Richard also calls me mama when referring to me with Bruno. For example: 'Go see mama!', 'Mama's home!', etc.",36,40,2020-07-09 20:55:00
774,NTA,AITA for voting against a hike for executives.,"&#x200B;Hi Everyone, \[sincere apologies for any grammatical errors, but please feel free to correct them.\]I am a 24-year-old, unmarried man in a senior position in an office. COVID has largely changed how we function as an organization. Our sales have been affected in ways similar to everyone else's and the initial days were hard.This meant we had to postpone the bonuses meant to arrive in March because it is important to keep the ship sailing and rightfully so. In April end, we decided to postpone the hike for employees so that we could convert our interns to full-time employees, because that felt more important and letting them go might mean they are unemployed for a good year, at least. I have been pro to these decisions and my arguments were aggressively for these decisions, which have gathered a bit of negative attention towards me from some senior employees in the company. Today, we took up the hike for employees again after we've started seeing some traction in business as the new normal has started settling in. My argument was to give hike, if possible, to employees in the mid-tier but hold out on the senior management including myself. The reason being the fact that with the last hike I received, I could actually hire a full-time employee for the firm, but it wouldn't cost so much to give a hike to the mid employees. 10% of what it costs to give me a hike is (way) more than 10% of giving a mid employee a hike. I also added that I think they'd need it more than me because their expenses would have increased with the change in lifestyle and we might already be having that lifestyle. Like good internet connections, good setups to work from, arrangements for shopping, and all. Many think I am being selfish as I am single and have no responsibilities, thus I do not need money. They have kids, and if I had them too, I wouldn't have been so biased. I think it almost got to a point where the moderator had to mute the call.I got a couple of messages saying I shouldn't just think about myself the whole time and I should think of everyone else too and that I am a selfish asshole. I did think of them too, in a very limited thought. Maybe, if I was okay at 24, they should be very well-off being in their late 30's and 40's. I mean it is a reasonable assumption to make, I guess? You know, for people in my/equivalent position being better that you financially with the age?I made a vote that was sensible to me, but I think I am losing some powerful friends with the move. This would probably/(definitely) affect my career. So, AITA?&#x200B;TL;DR: I am no saint. Love and need money as much as everyone else does. Thought I did not need it as much as regular employees did at the moment. Hence disagreed with the choice of giving a hike to senior management. Did not side with the argument of the majority. Did not hide the reason for the opinion. Is being called a selfish AH. AITA?",23,20,2020-07-14 17:22:42
882,NTA,AITA for not wanting my wife to make an Onlyfans account?,"My wife did some mild sex work online up until we started officially dating. I didn't know about this until a few months in which makes sense. I wouldn't want to talk about it on the first date. Whenever she mentions things like that she talks about how great the money is but claims she hated doing it. Since her old social media is still up albeit inactive, she has a lot of followers and she could make a lot of money if she started up again.She recently found out about Onlyfans and every now and then hints the possibility of making an account to make some extra cash. She always talks about other people who she knows that do it and she talks about the easy money that they make in such an envious way.When she brought it up first she said she wasn't going to post much of her body and would never be nude or show her face. But when she started being active on old SM again she immediately got requests to make nude content (photos and videos)for $100-200 and was ready to do it. She got mad when I said I didn't want that saying that I ""said I was okay with it at first."" She ended up not doing any of it but lately she is making it very obvious that she wants to be doing this even though she still claims to hate it and still says she wouldn't want to be recognized and she is acting like she holds a grudge against me for not ""letting"" her.The things that I said when this blew up before is that I felt like the sexual nature of our relationship was personal and was special to me and I asked if she made an Onlyfans account would she be okay with me paying for other girls accounts. She said no why would you spend money on other girls when you have me for free. I don't want to spend money on Onlyfans accounts but I was trying to make a point. It seems like of that is the case then she shouldn't do it. I have expressed that I won't stop her and that it's her body and her choice but I have also expressed how it would make me feel and so she is acting like I'm stopping her from doing it. So she hasn't done it but is resenting me for the way I feel about it when she would like to show off her body and make money she says I won't let her. Does this Make me an asshole? Does it make her an asshole? It's like she is respecting what I want but she resents me for it which doesn't feel like respect at all just more like spite.",20,47,2020-07-09 15:33:05
244,NTA,AITA for calling my best friend my sister in front of my blood sister?,"EDITIED TO ADD: I'm receiving professional help to work through the lasting effects of growing up in this. But I still freak out at any kind of conflict with these people because they've accused me of being dramatic or an ass for years, when in reality I was a depressed and anxious teen. Now I believe them when maybe I shouldn't about things like this. Background: I (21F) have always had a weird as hell family dynamic. My folks divorced when I was 4 and had split custody while I was growing up and my dad remarried a horrible, abusive, woman who hates me because I ""am a constant reminder that she's not my dad's first."" (Those were her exact words to me, even though SHE KNEW THIS well before they got married... I digress.) She's basically treated me like Cinderella my whole life and has trained the kids she had with my dad to do the same while my dad kinda stood idly by. Despite this and the fact that I was in and out of the house a bunch when they were growing up, both of the kids are really protective of their place in my life (a fact I wasn't aware of until recently). So fast forward, my birthday was Wednesday and my best friend (who has been a consistent and steady positive voice in my life since I moved out and got to college) posted something really sweet on my Instagram feed in which she called me her sister. I loved it, because she's really stepped into that role for me, and I called her my sister right back. A few minutes later I got kinda grilled on it from my little sister (13) over IG messenger but didn't think much of it... Until my dad called later and was telling me about how angry and hurt it made her. So now I feel like TA and really anxious about it. I told my best friend about what happened and now she feels bad too. I don't feel like my relationship with my friend is wrong, especially given how incredibly screwed up my dynamic with that side of my family is, but after my dad said what he did, Idk what to think. On one hand, I don't feel like my siblings should have the ability to lay claim to a place in my life if they're going to continue the abusive behavior patterns, but on the other hand, they ARE my blood, and they're young. I feel a sense of obligation to maintain a relationship with them, especially since I have a pretty significant disability that prevents me from walking and I've been warned from a young age that they'll probably be taking care of me once my parents pass. AITA or am I being gaslit (again)?",645,99,2020-07-10 15:38:05
471,NAH,AITA for wanting to go to a bar with my gf and her work friend?,"So me (24) and my gf (22), Megan (pseudonym), have ben going out for nearly 2 years now. We're pretty serious and committed to each other so there's no questioning either of out loyalty to each other. Lately, there's this guy from her work, we'll call him Dave (23), she's been hanging out with particularly at a local bar in their town. They enjoy each other's company as friends and I'm okay with it myself. I met Dave, he's a pretty decent dude, we got along pretty well.Recently however, Megan came to my house and met up with me just after work. She'd been aware Dave wanted to call and tell her something after he got off work himself. Lo and behold, shortly after I came home Dave called Megan and I was there, silent, for the whole conversation. Megan had her suspicions beforehand, which she made me aware of, and she turned out to be right. Dave had feelings for her and wanted to confess, asking her to keep it between the two of them. Megan let him down as best she could and affirmed her commitment to me. I have no doubt my presence didn't make a difference to her response; I trust her completely. They're still friends and, though he isn't aware that I know, I'm still cool with Dave as long as he doesn't overstep his boundaries.Cut to present, Megan has next Tuesday off and told Dave they could have a few drinks at the bar Monday night. I myself have some time and would like to join them which wasn't normally a problem before. She's asked me now if I wouldn't be upset if she asked me not to come. Her reason being she doesn't want to make Dave feel uncomfortable after his little confession. Ultimately, I don't mind her and Dave having a few drinks together without as I'm not worried about then doing much else. I personally feel scorned though, just wanting to have a couple beers with my girlfriend and Dave cause the more the merrier but honestly if he's uncomfortable with me being there and is still under the impression that I dont know about his feelings for Megan that's his problem and it shouldn't get in my of spending time with Megan, though I do respect him hope he finds someone else to be with him. Naturally this seems to possibly be spawning an argument that perhaps no one will be happy with the outcome of though I do hope it doesn't come to that. Am I the asshole though?Edit: I'm aware of the possibility but don't jump straight to the conclusion that she's cheating on me. You don't know us and you don't know our relationship. When I say I trust her that doesn't merely come from me needing to believe she wouldn't do such a thing. It's not her I'm worried about.",105,81,2020-07-10 18:26:52

Ive been introducing my close friends to persian food, and while they like it, they constantly make fun of it and the names.

136,NTA,"AITA for posting on social media when the teachers hid from me that my child fell down a flight of stairs, even though she was not hurt?","I was talking to my 7 year old yesterday when she told me that she fell down a flight of stairs last week. She was not hurt however, because if that were the case I would have known and I did not know about it til she told me.I gave her teacher a call and she conformed that it was true. According to the teacher daughter she was trying to sneak upstairs during break time and was caught by a school prefect. She tried to run but lost her balance and fell down a flight of stairs. The prefect went to a teacher who found my daughter crying at the bottom of the stairs. She was taken to the school nurse and was found to be completely fine, not hurt in any way. The teachers then decided that it wasn't an issue and this incident went as if it never happened. I was livid. The fact that my child fell down a FLIGHT OF STAIRS, which could normally end up VERY BADLY, was hidden from me just because she was miraculously unhurt? I don't know, this sounds wrong in so many ways. I should have the right to know if anything happened to my child in school out of the ordinary.I posted this incident on social media while demanding an explanation from the school. I was told by the school  that they hope that I could put it down because I am giving my daugher unnecessary attention. At the end of the day she was not hurt and I should just move on like she did. True to that, my daughter seems to be over it and doesn't seems to care. Should I drop this? Am I being the selfish AH for blowing this up?",2206,603,2020-07-10 19:23:14
141,NTA,AITA for yelling at a grocery store worker because she was stereotyping my daughter?,"Using a throwaway account.I (47F) have a teenage daughter (16f). Her dad died of cancer when she was a baby, and since then I have remarried to my current husband (48m). My husband is an essential worker so he is still going to work all day, every day.My daughter is severely disabled and in her case, even though she is 16 she cannot stay home alone, so whenever I have to go out of the house to do something essential, she comes with me. We take a lot of precautions (bring along hand sanitizer and masks, stay away from other people, etc.).On Friday I had to buy a few things from the grocery store, so my daughter came with me. Once we are there and shopping, someone who worked there came up to me and asked me why did I bring my daughter along. I gently explained about my daughter and then the grocery store worker said something along these lines ""your daughter looks pretty old, she should learn to stay home alone. Her disabilities are not an excuse for that.""Here is the part where I might have been TA. I completely lost it, I yelled about how it was rude to stereotype people, it was rude to dismiss someone's disabilities and loads of stuff. Once I was done she didn't say anything and just walked away, and me and my daughter (who was in the other aisle, and she is deaf, so she could not hear anything) finished our trip.When my husband came back from work that day, I told him what happened and he said I overreacted. I am not sure if I am in the wrong here. AITA?EDIT: A lot of people are asking what exactly her specific disabilities are.

759,YTA,AITA for getting mad at my fiance because she wants to wear an old dress to our impromptu courthouse wedding?,"So me (26M) and fiance K (24F) got engaged last June and had planned to get married this spring but then a global pandemic happened. We hadn't booked any venues or made deposits so no major losses there. It was a bit irresponsible for us to not have done so earlier but that's mostly because both us weren't equally enthusiastic about the whole process. I know women tend to be very excited about wedding planning but K hadn't even picked out a dress about almost month before the scheduled wedding and neither had we been able to finalise a guest list because she wasn't sure which people from her rather small social circle to invite. Anyway, all of that got put on hold.In our country cases are steadily dropping so during quarantine I suggested we should postpone to October and reduce it to a close friends and family only event. I had even made a deposit at my cousin's event hall. I made the guest list on my own, talked to caterers on my own, picked out the invites on my own. She seemed very disinterested throughout and agreed to everything without even opening the binder I had made for her.Then last week she said out of the blue that we should ""get a courthouse wedding and get over with it"". I was obviously crushed but I thought hey maybe she wanted this all along and that's why she was uninterested. We agreed and she booked an appointment for the next Sunday. She also didn't want any other people there, just us. I figured we could have a reception later but she just nodded at that.Because our wedding got fast tracked I had to pick an outfit quickly. I showed the tux to her and (I swear I am not kidding) she started laughing. She said there was no need to ""buy a tux for a courthouse wedding"". I mean, a wedding is a wedding, right? You pick out new clothes for the occasions you want to remember but she didn't seem to understand that. She then told me she wasn't gonna do that and wear a ""new dress"" (she has worn twice before to different events so no-one will notice it, according to her)I really got mad at that. Her dress isn't even a gown and to me that feels like she doesn't want to be a bride or that our wedding is not that important of an occasion to her. She really blew up at that, saying I was overreacting. She then said she doesn't wanna get married if it's gonna ""be on my terms"". I am currently sleeping on the couchA few of out mutual friends called me up and said I was being TA for ""micromanaging our wedding"" and ""controlling her choice of wedding dress"". On one hand I've been really hurt by her behaviour but also I think I am being unreasonable. So Reddit am I the asshole here?",26,88,2020-07-10 04:45:13

I decided to step in  as it did not look like she would stop with her monologue and my friend was kinda stunned into silence. I told her that it was fine and I didnt find the joke offensive at all. She replies, quote, You dont get to decide whats offensive and whats not. I tell her that in this situation, I do get to decide where something stands on in the offensive meter, since Im Indian. I kid you not, she legit replied saying  I dont think youre Indian. Youre not dark. I told her to fuck off and stop being offended on my behalf and to educate herself on issues before she tries to be a white saviour. I was a bit harsh and she ended up crying. I immediately apologised for the white saviour remark as I thought it was wrong but didnt apologise for anything else.

408,NTA,AITA for snapping back at my dad who made a comment about me gaining weight?,"I (22F) am currently living with my parents due to coronavirus. Nowadays I do most of the cooking and look after my little sister (16).After a call from his doctor, my dad has been constantly grilling us about watching what we eat due to our family history of diabetes. I am 52 and 114 lbs and consider myself to be relatively healthy. My sister is around my build, too. While we find his complaining annoying, we agreed to adjust our diet to include more vegetables and start exercising 1-2 hours every day. Over the past week, my dad has been picking on my sister about her body to the point where she locks herself in her room and cries. (While she is sensitive and does not take criticism well, I still think what my dad said was out of line and uncalled for.) This is also around the same time he bought two tubs of ice cream which he pretty much ate all by himself and then accused my sister for eating too much sugar. Yesterday, our family decided on having sandwiches for dinner. I made a veggie sandwich (ciabatta bread, avocado, spinach, mushroom, and a slice of mozzarella). My dad made a comment on my meal, saying that I was going to gain weight by eating all of it. He was eating a ham sandwich and then went back for a second helping of rice. Which brings me to today. I made the same sandwich again because it tasted really good and my sister has yet to try it. My dad told me I should eat half of it to (again) not gain weight. This is where I might have been/am the AH. I told him that I might as well not eat at all. That offended him and he told me to leave the table, and I did. For starters, I skipped breakfast and was really hungry by the time lunch came around. And when my stomach starts growling, my sass levels rise. Second, my dad and I (including my sis) already have a strained relationship. Because my parents work a lot, they rarely check in on us. My dad doesnt know my weight. Heck, he barely knows my own birthday. He just takes one look and assumes he knows everything. Third, he exercises, but he only does crunches for 20 minutes while me and my sister have a routine that works on all areas. Because of all these reasons, I just snapped. And as usual, he refuses to talk to me whenever there is conflict. So, AITA? (Sorry for the long read. But I will take whichever judgment you all give. Thanks.)",171,33,2020-07-12 21:59:43

We started dating in Tokyo while I was finishing my studies, then we came to Colombia and got married here since same sex marriage is not legalized in Japan, curiously enough my wife liked it here more.Anyway, when my mom and my wife met, I had to change many details during translation to help them get along, is not that they had radically different ideas, it was more because of cultural differences and I didn't want that to damage their interactions, I was also nervous because I came out to her during the wedding announcement.My mom wanted to make her some local desserts because I used to tell her that japanese food tastes really bland, she thought my wife would appreciate it, but she was too used to the blandness in food, so she didn't enjoy the ones with strong flavors and out of courtesy she bowed and said it didn't fit her taste, I didn't want to disappoint my mom, so I told her she said ""it was very delicious, I'm impressed"" my mom got excited and got up to the kitchen to bring her some more, and I told my wife ""she says she'll try to make better dishes next time"" and then stop my mom from bringing her more.One day, my mom came for my birthday and brought all my ex girlfriends with her.I'm from a small town where she lives right now, and came to my house with 3 girls that she thinks were my best friends, it was hell.I wasn't out to my mom back then, but my wife knew all of them were my exes because we talked about them and I showed her pictures, I also didn't want to tell my mom that I dated all these girls she brought, worrying that she would think badly of me, but my wife thinks it's really disgraceful to lie to your parents so I told her that she knew they were my exes.I had to change basically everything they asked about each other and compromising contexts to keep my mom and wife oblivious of the situation, my wife would ask in front of my mom to one of them ""how was dating me"" and I changed it to ""was I a good friend?""It was honestly exhausting and I don't even remember what I said.Eventually she started learning spanish, and by the time she got confident enough to hold a conversation with my mom, they both noticed how many small details they thought they knew about each other, weren't... Exactly accurate, and they found out that I was the source of the incoherent information.My wife, who has never been really angry at me stopped talking to me since yesterday when I admitted what I did, she said a translator duty is to be faithful to the meaning and not interfere with it and that basically what I did was lie to her and my mom. She understands I only meant to protect the relationship with each other but she believes I censored them.I apologized and promised to never do it again, but also I don't feel like I made a mistake big enough to provoke such a strong response so AITA?",64,46,2020-07-11 07:46:54
301,YTA,AITA for asking my MIL to put some clothes on?,"My husband and I had been planning a wedding, but it got pushed back twice due to family circumstances and then covid so we decided to just screw it and get married. His parents live near the ocean and have a beautiful view so we did the wedding in their yard with just our immediate families. My parents would have had to stay overnight and they do not have the financial means, so my in laws very graciously said they could stay at their house. It was only two nights and two days, but I was a little worried about our families mixing.My mother was very nervous about the trip. My parents are both working class, average people and my mom has always been very insecure about her looks/body. My MIL is honestly hot, very aware of it and likes to walk around in a bikini. The day my parents got there she was sunbathing when they arrived and didn't cover up at all. We later went out on FIL's boat and again she just wore a bathing suit. Even the night we had dinner at the house she ate in just her bikini. My mom expressed how uncomfortable this made her, so I explained to MIL that my mom feels very intimidated and maybe she could wear a cover up when she isn't in the water. She didn't say much, but she came down in leggings and her husband's sweatshirt in 85 degree heat to make a point I guess. That lasted five minutes and she changed into shorts and a tank top, but she was very cold the rest of the weekend. My husband says it was rude to ask his mom that and now I feel like I started off my marriage on the wrong foot.",414,97,2020-07-11 22:34:12
85,NTA,WIBTA if I dont let my bfs brothers gf meet my baby?,"Im sorry if the title is confusing but Ive been having problems with my bfs brother gf, lets call her Stacy. Ever since I announced Im pregnant Stacy has been very mean towards me. Shes started talking behind my back to my bfs sister. His sister said some stuff she said didnt sit right with her so she told me all Stacy has been saying. It turns out she has PCOS and shes upset that Im pregnant, because I didnt want kids until I met my bf. She told my bfs sister that shes been wanting a baby since she can remember and I havent wanted kids until about a year ago. Shes been making me feel like I dont deserve to be pregnant. If i pee too often shell roll her eyes and tell my bfs sister shes not even that far along, shes being dramatic and peeing too much. Shes has said a lot more stuff that Im not comfortable repeating. She has also been trying to get my bfs cousins to dislike me. So now about half of his cousins think Im a terrible person who is bullying Stacy (I dont even talk to her anymore). I just dont feel comfortable letting someone who is making me feel bad about being pregnant meet my son. Im sorry if its confusing, Ive never really talked about it to anyone. WIBTA if I didnt let her come into the hospital room to meet my baby?Edit: for those asking, I havent told my boyfriend because Im scared of making the problem worse, but I think Im going to talk to him about it today. Im scared to tell his family because I have no family here, so Im scared that theyll hate me if i say something.",4430,325,2020-07-15 11:59:35
80,NTA,AITA? My sister wants me to adopt her baby but I want a different kid.,"I know this is a little above this sub's paygrade but there's not many people I can talk to in real life so I'm turning to the internet.My husband had shitty birth parents, so he and his siblings were removed and put into the adoption system. They tried to keep the siblings together, but at the time they were put in, my husband and his full brother were far older than their younger half siblings. The younger 2 (a baby and a toddler) were adopted almost immediately, then my husband was adopted at 10, and his older brother aged out at 18. The oldest 3 reunited, but they're still looking for the youngest.My husband and I want to adopt. Ideally, we want to adopt siblings, so we can keep them together, and preferably older kids (10+) as we know it's harder for older kids to get adopted. Obviously it totally depends on the kids we meet and who we work with as a potential family, but we feel very strongly about adopting older siblings and keeping them together (so if we were to really click with older but unrelated children or found a set of siblings that included children younger than 10 we'd adapt that plan for them). The process takes a while, but we're nearly at the end of it. We've been approved as adoptive parents, and were matched with two siblings recently, but something happened with their birth family so the adoption was denied. We've been told that they'll re-match us very soon, but we've been waiting to hear back for a while now. There was meant to be an open day at a local home but it's been postponed due to current events.Enter my youngest sister. She's 19, in university, and pregnant. She was going to terminate but couldn't bring herself to do it. She reached out to us, asking us to adopt her child. We're approved as adoptive parents, we have a decently sized house with more than enough room, she and the father would willingly allow us to adopt the baby, and it would be a very short process for us because we are basically good to go here. However, due to the reasons stated above, this isn't exactly what we had in mind in terms of adopting. We're open to changing that plan, but there's also the issue of my sister being the bio mum. She says she can handle watching me potentially raise her baby, but I can't see this not causing issues, and feel like if she's going to adopt out she should do it with a couple who aren't so close to home. We explained this and refused.Since then various relative, none of whom can take the baby for various reasons, have contacted us asking why we can't take the baby. We've explained and re-explained everything but we're getting called selfish/mean/cruel for ""being picky"" because we are at a place in our lives where we can have a baby and we're turning it down. We thought about asking our friends who are also trying to adopt what they think but saying ""my sister offered me a baby but we don't want it"" would be pretty tone deaf when some of them have been waiting years for one, and that whole sentiment combined with my family's arguments has made us feel incredibly guilty, so we're turning to the internet.Are we TA?Info: we're in the UK, and my husband and I have both been in our current employments for over 2 years, meaning we both have full access to paternity/maternity leave ~~(up to a year of leave for me and 2 weeks for him (the system on that is honestly absurd but that's another rant for another time))~~ (turns out that whole bit is wrong and we'd be allowed to share our leave so ignore it), and we took adoptive parenting classes that included baby stuff so we are able to look after a baby, both in terms of competency and finances, but we do feel we'd prefer an older child (preferably child*ren*) and we don't know if having a baby could affect our current adoption attempts. We want multiple children, as we're both from big families, and a baby in the house could cause an issue as we're trying to adopt older children (eg they might think we just want a free babysitter).&#x200B;Update: I told my sister about our friends mentioned earlier, how they're a great couple who have been trying to adopt a baby for 5 years now, how they've fostered babies and taken all the classes and know what they're doing, how they live locally and are willing to have an open adoption, and again repeated that myself and my husband don't want to adopt a baby. My sister said that open adoption to a ""couple of strangers"" wouldn't work for her, and a couple hours later said that mum and dad are going to help her out, so it looks like the baby will live with them for the next few years and my sister and her boyfriend will take over when they can. Everyone now feels like I am somehow at fault for my parents not getting to enjoy the beginning of their retirement, but I no longer feel guilty as it's clear that was what my sister wanted all along - someone to raise the baby for a few years so she could step in as the mother whenever it suited her.",4403,592,2020-07-11 20:18:20

Yesterday, I had to change a fuel pump in a Subaru Outback. Not a bad job to do, except for the fact the customers car absolutely SMELLED of weed, cat piss and fast food. After finally getting the back seat out of its place so I could reach the fuel pump, I found an open container of milk that had turned into cottage cheese. As soon as I saw it, the smell hit me in the face and I threw up in the car before I could get out. Obviously, we had to tell the girl what happened and that we werent going to complete the job due to what happened and the fact that my father felt bad about sending me in the car. The girl got very upset and said I owe her a free cleaning and an apology. I said absolutely not. I tried to not complain about the smell and be focused on properly completing the job. But I felt she didnt hold up well on her end of having a safe car for me to enter. I feel a little bad, but Im still angry about the whole situation. Am I the Asshole?",121,35,2020-07-15 17:20:27

We always knew my dad was a homophobe by some of the comments he makes and getting upset when he see stuff about gay people on TV. So when my younger brother came out to us and my dad completely lost it. My dad kicked him out of the house and completely cut contact with him. I kept in contact with my brother during this period, but my dad was adamant not speak to him throughout the years and he didn't attend my brother wedding. Couple of years after the wedding my dad passed away. In his inheritance he split half of it to me and donated the other half that suppose to be my brother before he came out to a charity devoted for veterens.

568,NAH,AITA for taking away my daughters internet privileges?,"My daughter (25) has autism and has always struggled to make friends since back when she was in school. Since she graduated college, she felt lonely and began trying to message and follow strangers in social media (mainly those who share her interests of cartoons and video games). While some respond better than others, many have blocked her. When shes blocked, she then says she circumvents blocks to contact these people on her other accounts. I have told her that is harassment and not acceptable nor appropriate. Ive told her she could potentially get sent to jail because the police could track her IP address. She could lose her job and get herself in trouble that I cant get her out of. Ive also mentioned these people could complain to the website staff who could disable her account. My husband & I expressed this concern to her psychiatrist who suggested we take her internet privileges away when she evades blocks. However, my daughter became upset and started crying. We sat down with our daughter and discussed expectations. We tell her that any attempt to get around blocks on spare accounts will result in loss of her iPad, phone, and any electronics except for her work computer that she uses for her job. She has been arguing and making a stink about our expectations.Ive then told her that while I understand her desire for friendship and social connection, she is looking in the wrong places. Before the pandemic, her dad/my husband and I have repeatedly tried to find her IN PERSON clubs and activities (such as art classes, improv clubs, etc) for young adults.

607,NTA,AITA for wanting my mom to help pay for my airpods?,"Here's some backstory:           A couple days ago I was playing basketball by myself in our driveway with the AirPods in my ear (as I do almost everyday). My mom came outside and after about 30 seconds of watching me, she walked over and started trying to take the ball from me. I think she was just trying to play, but at the time it was slightly irritating because I was working on my shots and didn't expect it. However, I just decided to go along with it.            About a minute later, she accidentally hit my ear with her fist and the left Airpod fell on the pavement. I went inside to make sure it wasn't broken, and it would not turn on or charge. My mom says if I want to replace them, I would have to pay the full price. All of my birthday money and Christmas money from the past 2 years can pay for about half of it, so I asked her if she could pay the other half since she kinda contributed to their breaking. She has been refusing to do so, because ""I shouldn't have been wearing them playing basketball"".                   I got these as a birthday present a couple years ago and I use them all the time, and right now I don't think i'll be able to replace them.p.s. I'm not mad at her for it because I know it was an accident, I just think it's a reasonable to ask for.AITA for wanting her to pay half?",49,15,2020-07-11 18:17:17
855,ESH,AITA for openly telling my husband I hated his choice of baby name?,"Throwaway account.I (29f) and my husband (31m) have been married for almost 5 years, and I am pregnant with twins. They will be our first children and are due at the beginning of September. Both twins are girls.My husband and I decided very early on that I will name one twin and he will name the other. For a long time, I had known that I would name a child after my grandmother, and the middle name would be my middle name (family tradition is that the mother's middle name is the eldest daughter's middle name). Told my husband this, he was perfectly fine with it and agreed that the names were cute together.Husband had not given future baby names any thought until that moment, and has been giving it serious thought over the last few months but was unable to find one he liked. Until last week.Husband is an old soul and enjoys watching 80s TV shows (Dallas, Cheers, etc). Late one night, he was watching some TV show and there was a character called Valene, and Husband said it was a lightbulb moment - he wanted to name the other twin Valene, with the middle name Marie, after his grandmother, so for example the name would be Valene Marie Smith (not our surname). Husband says he is not naming the twin after the character, but because he likes the name.I instantly told him that I like Marie, but there was absolutely no way on this Earth our child would be called Valene. For one, I just don't like the name, and for second, our child will probably be the only Valene in all of Britain and would likely be teased at school.My husband set his heart on Valene Marie, and for the last two weeks has been trying to make me change my mind, but I won't. A couple of nights ago, he said that if I hated it so much I could name both the twins and he'll have no part in it.I still want him to name one of the twins, but now he says he won't and I feel awful for refusing to consider his choice of name.AITA?",22,38,2020-07-10 14:44:03

As a young queer woman myself (F18) I understand how much homophobia hurts but being surrounded by it my whole life I just saw past it, as the years went by I came to realize that it wasnt enough to just not be homophobic, I had to distance myself from it. The problem being that most of my friends were homophobic, very openly and proudly which always disgusted me, my bestfriend (M18) being one of them. I thought that since we were still young and still lived on our tiny, mostly conservative, island I could give him the benefit of the doubt, I thought maybe when we go away for college ( we have to go to a different country for college ) itll open his mind more. I quickly came to realize that that wasnt going to happen so I had an honest conversation with him, I asked him if he would ever even try to open his mind and he told me he could never, I tried to make him see how he was hurting me and he was being ignorant about the whole situation, he told me I was overreacting. So I ended our friendship. Now I ask because he pointed out to me that I still have other friends that are homophobic and I was just looking past it. Im slowly distancing myself from those other people but I was being harder on him because I had more faith in him since hes always trying to be against injustices and is for equal rights for everyone, except gay and trans people, now I just feel guilty because weve been friends for years.

I'll call his daughter Rosie, age 11. I've helped John a lot with Rosie in the past couple years, as have a lot of our friends. John has mostly male friends and I'm one of the few friends from college that still lives in the same city as him. I taught him to braid hair, paint nails, buy clothes for a little girl, etc. He's a fantastic dad but can be overwhelmed raising his daughter alone without a constant female presence.He spoke to me recently about how he's worried about Rosie starting her period soon, and asked that I give her the period talk for him so she's not caught off guard. (His late wife started her's young as well, apparently.) He's educated himself on the subject already, but wanted someone with first hand experience to do the Big Talk. I believe he was also uncomfortable (or maybe nervous?) about talking about his child's reproductive health. I gently told him no, I think he should be the one to do it. I'd be happy to fill in gaps in knowledge he had, but since he's Rosie's sole parent he needs to be there so she knows he's not ashamed or embarrassed by her period and is someone to go to for help. (I personally know how it feels to have an unsupportive father that's embarrassed by female bodily functions). I told John that after he talks to Rosie and she actually starts her period I'd be happy to sit down with her and have a ""girl-to-girl"" talk as well.John insisted he wasn't embarrassed or unsupportive, but didn't want to make his daughter uncomfortable talking about her ""private parts"" with her dad. I told him she'd only be uncomfortable if *he* made it uncomfortable. We didn't have any kind of crazy fight, but he backed off asking me, although I'm unsure if he'll listen to my advice.My husband thinks maybe I should have given in because John's been through a lot, but I'm looking out for Rosie too.

Hes saying Im being controlling and that this should be a joint decision and I cant just say no- I think Im being reasonable in how much dog we can handle. AITA for vetoing the 3 breeds my husband wants?UPDATE: after so many comments recommended it- I brought up a greyhound rescue and he agreed to look into it!! There is actually one about 20 miles away so we will call and make an appointment to either look or talk about it (not sure what steps this place takes) We have a fenced in yard, no other animals and an established vet (for references if this place asks) so fingers crossed it works out. Thanks for everyone suggesting!!!",6607,963,2020-07-11 00:14:52
580,YTA,AITA For cutting-short a visit with the in-laws?,"For the past two weeks, my wife and I have been visiting my wife's family with our 10-month-old son. We drove here and bought an open Channel Tunnel rail ticket, meaning we could return any time. I work from home, so can technically do it anywhere on the planet. When we bought the ticket, we were undecided about when to return, but the agreement was always ""we'll go for two weeks, but stay for more if we want to"". During the first week, I was talking with my wife saying ""well we could stay a little longer, there's no reason to go home, and it's easy to relax with your parents looking after the kids."" The problem is that ten days in, I am exhausted living with the in-laws and need to get home to my life and my house. My wife, however, is not keen on returning. She has maternity leave until the end of august, and works in healthcare, so never is allowed any more than a week or so of leave at a time, so now is the only opportunity she can get to spend a long time here. Furthermore, the free childcare from her parents means she gets more of a chance to relax, time which neither of us have had since we are constantly entertaining and cleaning-up-after our son - which we will eventually have to return to.As for me, I'm starting to really feel the stress of living with the in-laws, they treat my wife as their child (rightfully so), but I end up being lumped-in with this, despite being in my thirties and a father, which is *constantly* infuriating. There are comments about me doing anything in the house, such as getting a snack, getting coffee, going out of the house for a walk, going for a drive to the shop - comments which I don't get when living at home. When I drive them anywhere, the comments get worse, making sure I'm driving safely, commenting on directions, explaining everything simplistically. There's comments about making sure my son is safe when he does things, which I have managed to achieve by myself in his ten month lifespan without problems. It's infantilising and after this time is really grating. On top of this, my car is only insured for two weeks of international travel. To extend this, I - as the only one of us earning a wage - have to call my insurer (not easy in another country) and pay for an extension that I don't necessarily want, but I know it's hard for my wife in her situation. The other day, I bought the return train ticket on the day we were originally planning and my wife was not happy. She said ""You said we were going to stay for longer!"" and then got upset about us returning, and chastised me for going back on my word, and that I was depriving her of more time with her parents. I feel like shit having done it. We've been discussing on-and-off whether we would stay for another week, but we never said anything consequential, now she's really upset and quite resentful. Am I the asshole here? I feel like something went wrong along this process and could use some help.",62,37,2020-07-15 14:25:15
623,ESH,AITA for telling my son to go to a hotel when he needed somewhere to stay for a few days?,"My son had some flooding in his apartment and asked if he could stay with us for a few days with his wife and two year old daughter. I told him the truth, I can't stand his wife and she is not allowed in my home. She is so trashy beyond belief. Last time she was here she had a fight with my fifteen year old daughter and tried to mark her with a sharpie because my daughter said how gross her tattoo was. I threatened to call 911 (I wasn't actually going to) and she ran off. I called her that night and told her that she is absolute trash and she will never step foot in my house again. Now he is upset saying they can't afford a hotel and that we are terrible parents, but my daughter said if we let this woman in the house she will stay with friends and my husband said he's not even going to try to be civil. He literally said he's going to tell her she's ""heinous looking filth and he is going to spit on her grave"" I don't want to listen to any of this drama so I stuck with my original answer, but I know they are in a tight financial situation.",45,71,2020-07-10 21:41:12
24,NTA,AITA for publicly shaming my ex girlfriend who is an aspiring Instagram model?,"I have a 17 year old daughter. Im not her bio dad but Ive been in her life since she was four and I married her mom. We divorced when she was 13 and unfortunately her mother has some mental issues she refuses to treat so I took full custody. I recently dated a woman who was probably too young for me (25) and she was an Instagram model though not very successful.My daughter did a little child modeling and has had a lot of success on Instagram. There were times I felt like my girlfriend was using my daughter for Instagram likes and she seemed jealous of her. Besides that they got along alright. I broke up with my girlfriend two months ago after he stupidest fight. My daughter said something about college and my girlfriend wanted to know if I was still going to pay for her college despite the Instagram money.Technically shes made enough to pay for college but I intend to pay for her education and she can use that money for her future. This upset my girlfriend for some reason and she was whining about how no one paid for her school and she has so much debt and she needs her Instagram career to take off. My daughter said maybe you should get a day job, which maybe was a little bitchy but shes not wrong, and my girlfriend said maybe you should get some real parents. I just saw red. I kicked her out that night and that was the end of our relationship.Well today I saw a picture she posted on damn Instagram of the three of us as a throwback Thursday. I feel like she is just using my daughters name to get attention so I commented that I would like all pictures of my underage daughter removed from her account and I included what she said. I guess she got some hate because she left me a voicemail crying.",11472,671,2020-07-10 03:04:36
279,NAH,AITA for not telling my husband (or anyone) that I had a child once?,"My husband is 37, I am 35. Married 3 years, known 4.I am currently expecting my husband's first child.My previous relationship resulted in a child, and this is what this is about.I had my son when I was 28, fathered by my then boyfriend. It seemed to be a normal pregnancy, but it wasn't. At almost 7 months I found out that my child was not viable. He was missing both his kidneys - if he still had one, they could have maybe saved him, but not with both goneThose last 2 months of pregnancy were horrible. People congratulating me while I already knew he'd die. But I think it also helped me, because I had time to get it in my head my son would not live.When he was born I held him in my arms, cried, but knew I had to let go. My absolutely wonderful friend took pictures of me and my baby, giving me a wonderful memento to him. Grieving him was...hard, but bearable knowing he never had the chance to live. I know this sounds awful, but I just wanted people to let me forget. I feel like I became like this pariah, the ""woman who lost a child"" and my family, coworkers and some friends treated me differently. I just wanted to be normal. People were also asking if I'd try again, but at that time this was not something on my mind. This all strained my relationship with my boyfriend, and 2 years after we decided to separate.I wanted out. I was fortunate to find a temporary job abroad, and took it. Then six months after that, I moved to yet another country where I met my current husband.I started over and did not tell anyone about my dead baby. Not my colleagues, not my new friends, not even my husband. We were getting an ultrasound and the technician asked me if it was my first pregnancy and without even thinking I said no. Well of course this all came flooding.He is very upset that I did not tell him. First because I think he's not robbed of the illusion it's 'our first child', but also because he feels this was something  this was something fundamental about me and he wanted me to confide in him. He said he wished he would have known so he could have ""acted accordingly"" for whatever that means. But this is exactly the reason I didn't say. I don't want people to 'act accordingly'. I don't want to be forever branded as the mother of a dead baby and tiptoed around.So, AITA?",957,173,2020-07-15 16:45:27
602,YTA,AITA for comforting my mom instead of my gf?,"A brief family history: My parents used to be cruel to her (as was I, but I was young and immature - I've changed now). They would stalk her and try to get her fired or evicted, and a whole bunch of other stuff. Every time my gf would make the effort to fix things for my sake, they'd ignore or threaten her. Then later, during family stuff, my gf would rarely go but when she did she said she felt judged and left out, and that I never included her. So she stopped trying entirely. I think my parents have changed but she doesn't believe it.Well last Christmas, my gf surprised me by inviting my family to Christmas Eve with her family. It was the first time the two families were getting together. But I guess, in my gf's opinion, everything went wrong and is still hurt from how I acted. This is what I need judgment for. The doorbell rang (it was at her brother's house) and my gf told me I should greet the guests. I went by the door and was shocked to see my family come in. It took me a few seconds to even process they were really there. Then I started crying and hugging my mom thanking her for coming. Then I went to hug her brother and thanked him profusely for having them over. Then went back to hugging my brother and dad and was crying the whole time. This was when my gf said she started feeling hurt. That I barely thanked her or recognised how hard it was for her to set it up, since I hugged my family the whole time and thanked her brother but not her. Honestly I was just shocked. The whole night was great for me, and the most thoughtful gift from my gf. For years, I mostly spent Christmas Eve with her family, and this was the first time my family was there, so I didn't notice my gf was silent and feeling left out. And I saw my mom was feeling nervous so the whole night, I sat beside her and hugged her. After it was all over and we were leaving, she started crying in the car. She said she felt neglected, and that I spent the whole time comforting my mom when she felt she needed the comfort more, since in her opinion, the situation was harder on her. I told her that she had her whole family for comfort and she said that my mom also had her family, and that she's also not close with her family so she needed me and I wasn't there for her. She also was upset that I didn't firmly stop my dad from pressuring her into giving them grandchildren (I didn't know how) and that I didn't defend her when the first thing he said to her was that she got fat. Honestly, I didn't hear it since I was so emotional in the beginning. Well now she doesn't want to be involved in my family stuff since she said if it'll be like that again, there's no point. I know I could have handled it better, but I was just happy to see my family. I want them to hang out but my gf doesn't trust them and doesn't trust me to have her back around them.So AITA? Or is she overreacting?Character limit prevents me from adding more details, so just ask fo any clarification needed!",46,128,2020-07-13 01:16:39
907,NAH,AITA for trying to stay positive?,"My partner (24M) and I (24M) have been together about 3 years, and we've lived together for about 2 years, but the last week has absolutely been the worst, and I'm not sure if there's anything more I could've done to make things any better.We both have issues, but our relationship has been a healthy one. Certainly we're not perfect, but we've always been here for each other and we're very clear about what is and isn't okay for us. I don't like when I'm coerced to do things I'm uncomfortable with or when physical confrontation is brought up, and he doesn't like me raising my voice or being passive-aggressive.Then this week started. Our AC went out on Sunday, and we have been struck by a heatwave. Our landlady has promised us that it would be fixed four times now, and so far something has come up every time. They gave us a portable unit, but it's not very powerful.Meanwhile, he went outside the apartment for the first time the other day. It was just a trip to the store, we picked out some snacks and had a night in, nothing big, but it was a big deal for him as his first trip out. He also has OCD, so his fear of contracting the virus is very high, and I think he was very brave to challenge his disorder like that.Every time that our AC's repair got delayed I tried to stay positive and say it'll be fixed tomorrow, as promised. He's kinda freaked out about our state's corona stuff, and every time he freaks out I tell him that he's not been out anywhere, and I've been extremely safe, he's okay.Tonight, we learned that a dear friend of ours who lives a few hours away is living with someone who is sick. I think that news broke something in him, and he got upset. Just yelling and freaking out and hyperventilating, all coming back around to ""I went out yesterday and now I KNOW I am sick, and about to die."" I responded by saying that we've been safe, and I'm just as concerned for our friend but we've not seen them in months, so we're okay.I tried not to, but I did raise my voice a little to get him to stop screaming. He asserted that I was being insensitive because I yelled at him, and he stormed off. Since he left, he's been making a racket upstairs, and it sounds like he's just been hitting some empty boxes form our last move. Despite me not actually thinking he's going to hurt himself or me, it has definitely activated a trauma response from my last relationship.He's been blaming me for being passive, patronizing, and raising my voice. I think he's been aggressive and unreasonable. I don't think any of this would have happened if we hadn't been subjected to prolonged stressors with multiple promised fixes that haven't manifested this week. So, I feel like my passiveness has greatly exacerbated his problems and my ongoing attempts to stay positive have only made him mad, since it seems like I'm not doing anything and I don't care about his problems.

1,NTA,AITA for getting mad at my sister for not wanting me shirtless at her pool?,"My sister and her husband invited me over to their pool today for a little BBQ. I assumed it would just be me, my sister, her husband, my nephews, and my parents. But turns out they also invited her husbands side of the family. When it was time to get in the pool, I changed into my swim trunks and removed my shirt. But my sister stopped me before I came out their house and asked to keep my shirt on because of my scars. She was referring to the scars from when I had my top (chest) surgery. Im a trans guy. Had started transitioning 8 yrs ago and my surgery was 4 years ago. My scars have already faded and theyre pretty well hidden under my pecs. Youd have to look really close to even notice. Ive been to their pool many times and shes never said anything before so I was surprised. Every other guy including my dad were all shirtless in the pool. When I asked what the prob was with my scars she said she was uncomfortable with her in laws knowing Im trans. My feelings were hurt but I was mainly pissed. She said she didnt want her in laws to look at her differently if they found out about me. She told me not to make a big deal and to go with it. When she left, I went back inside to change because i wasnt gonna go in the pool with a shirt on. I only had the one I came wearing because I didnt expect her to ask me this. My mood was soured after that and I didnt wanna be around her so I decided to leave. When I said bye to everyone they were all confused since I was only there less than an hour. My dad pulled me aside and asked why I was leaving early. I told him to ask my sister and left. An hour later my sister called me upset because she and my dad got into a fight. My parents were furious about what she told me and they ended up leaving early too. Now shes angry at me for ruining the bbq and said I didnt have to cause all this drama if I only did what she asked.What she said hurt me and I was no longer in a mood to be around her or anyone else, but I didnt mean for all that to happen. Am I the asshole for getting mad at her and basically ruining their day?",29435,771,2020-07-12 06:47:52
74,NTA,AITA for not forcing my child out of the house at 18?,"My child's father and I have very different parenting philosophies. He very much believes that kids need to be out of the house at 18 and self supporting, and there is no ""relying on mom and dad"". I definitely don't have that idea. My family doesn't have any kind of ""you need to be out of my house by x age"" ideas. I didn't move out for the first time until I was 21, and I lived with my parents off and on after until I got my current place almost 20 years ago. It's not anything to do with gender and it's not a ""you can mooch off of us forever"" dynamic, the kids are expected to be working or in school, but it's not a huge deal for them to live with parents unless they're addicts, make really terrible decisions, or are just lazing around. My family doesn't produce many kids due to late marriage and low fertility, and family dynamics are just different when you know you're only having one kid versus families with potentially unlimited kids. My place is a 2 bedroom that is set up as a ""roommate"" situation.  Everyone told me I would quickly outgrow it and it would be inconvenient, but life only allowed me one pregnancy before my system gave out, so I never did. My child is doing well in school, is perfectly well behaved, and will be going to college in the fall, although online now. There's absolutely no reason I wouldn't let them live with me as an adult. They may not find it ideal, but there's no reason they would have to be homeless. My child's father remarried a woman with a child and had 3 more kids, bringing his total to 5 kids. He has a typical three bedroom. We have monthly family meetings, and at the most recent one, he brought it up, I guess trying to scare them, and starting talking all this crap about them ""finding their own place soon"" and ""life wouldn't always be this easy"". I was taken aback and said that it was ridiculous, of course my child will have a home, at least with me anyway, and that it wasn't my fault he had so many children that he had to make these arbitrary deadlines. He was enraged that I was ""undermining him"" and letting my child ""hide behind me and from adult life"". We left soon after.My family is telling me that I should have been less blunt about it and just kept things on the downlow because I basically just said that their father was just a blowhard with no authority. I mean...if the shoe fits, but I suppose I maybe could have not thrown his opinion out so bluntly.",4956,424,2020-07-12 17:39:52

This is the first time my dad has seen her dress like this; she used to dress a bit more conservatively when she was younger. I dont know if hes looking at her in a perverted way, but he does have a history of liking young women (and even having affairs with them. Why my mom hasnt left him is beyond me).

I also have ""daddy issues"" that I need to sort and would feel more comfortable with an older male, rather than someone my own age. Anyway when I said this my sister said I was an AH and sexist.

865,YTA,AITA for calling my sister autistic even though she isn't?,"Title sounds bad. Just hear me out. Also throwaway.I (19M) have a 13 y/o sister who's a bit of a geek. She's really into Avatar, Starwars, and Percy Jackson. I don't have much of an interest in those things but it's whatever. My sister has this habit of getting into these really strong phases where she's obsessed with a certain show, movie, book, whatever for a little while until it dies down. (Her Starwars phase never rlly ended though.) Whenever she does this, she tends to ramble about whatever she's currently obsessed with and brings it up a lot which gets pretty annoying. I tell her it's kind of autistic that she gets so obsessed with these things and that it's like the only thing she thinks about for an extended period of time. I just think it's weird and I call it autistic and after awhile she stops talking about it. In reality I only mean it as a joke. I don't actually think she's autistic but it gets kinda annoying and I call her it, but I say it in a joking tone and she sometimes says it back to me in a few cases like, I'll be doing something weird and she'll be like, ""bro you're calling me this and you're out here doing this,"" so I assumed she didn't really care. Here's an example: I found out that sometimes she chills in her room wearing this starwars robe thing, (wasn't like a wookie costume, just like something jedi robes,) because apparently it ""makes her feel kinda cool"" and she ""thinks it's kinda fun."" And then she had her lightsaber and was talking about how cool it is and ""look it lights up"" and she was going on so I called her autistic. It's that kind of thing. Basically we were in an argument and long story short I told her that she was sensitive and easily bothered. She asked me how it was possible for her to be sensitive if she put up with me calling her autistic all the time. I basically told her like, ""come on, that's obviously a joke,"" and she got really mad and hasn't really been talking to me since the argument. (The argument was over me criticizing and saying bad things about her online friends a lot, she asked me to stop since it bothers her, I told her no because I have every right to express my feelings about her friends, and I thought it was kind of sensitive of her to get so bothered over it.)So reddit, am I really the asshole for calling my sister autistic a lot when it was very obviously supposed to be a joke?",24,85,2020-07-14 05:39:46

626,YTA,WIBTA if i asked my cousin not to name his son my given name?,"My cousin is expecting their second baby. I just heard they are thinking about naming him my given name, which also happens to be our grandpa's name(that is why they want to name him that way), if he ends up being a boy. I don't have an issue sharing a name with someone else, in fact I have gone by my middle name since I was very young so it wouldn't really affect me that way at all. The issue comes from the fact that the name in question was passed on from my grandpa to my dad and then to me, and to carry on that tradition I was also going to name my first boy the same. This is common knowledge in my family, so my cousin is very aware of this. I don't want to sound entitled at all, but honestly it's a bummer to me because I feel that part of this little tradition will be taken away in a sense. I understand that I could also name my son the same name and no one would probably think anything of it, but part of me is bugged that he wouldn't consider that in his choice of name. But I also see how I can't claim a name for myself and keep others from naming their children how they want, especially because he has every right to name his son after his grandpa that he obviously loves very much. So what do you guys say, WIBTA if I asked him to consider other names?Edit: After the overwhelming response of YTA I think that seems to be the consensus and that is what I have accepted as the answer. If you want to continue and add your input go on ahead, I did just want to clarify a few things that seem to be misinterpreted by some from my story.1) The baby is not born yet, I am not asking them to rename their baby, nor have they come out and said for sure their baby will have that name, rather they gave a small list of names they like and that name was at the top of their list. I would never ask someone to rename their baby after they have been named, post or pre birth.2) I would never approach him and demand that he change his mind. I was going to just talk to him about it, we are pretty close so talking to each other about something thats bothering us wouldnt be totally out of left field. I would be prepared to accept no as an answer.3) I have mentioned it in the comments, but people are wondering why this would bother me so much. In my family we go out of the way to not double up on names. When someone has a baby and they name that baby, everyone that might have had that name on their list crosses it off. So there is a part of me that feels like I couldn't also name my baby the same without getting beef from my family. That is of course just me speculating about the situation, there is no evidence to suggest that they would actually get mad at me if I named my future baby the same, but I am worried that it would.4) I am married and my wife and I have been trying for a few months. We just experienced the loss of her pregnancy last week, and if the baby had ended up being a boy we planned to name him as discussed in this subreddit. My cousin of course did not know that, I am not claiming he is doing this in any malicious manner. Just more background because people seem to think I am not currently in a situation to have kids and I am attempting to placehold a name before I am actually married/ready for kids. We plan on having many kids, so the odds of us having a boy are high(but definitely not for sure) None of this is meant to sway people in one direction or the other. I am just addressing some of the questions people have asked, as well as some of the misconceptions people seem to be getting from my original post. I am not mad at my cousin, i was just wondering if IWBTA if I tried to talk to him about it.",46,68,2020-07-15 00:46:21
285,ESH,Aita for not letting my daughter go on her 18th bday trip (in december),"Some context is required for this issue. My daughter  (17F) and her friends planned a trip to go to Japan during her Christmas break to celebrate her 18th birthday. She had been planning this for the last 2 years.I decided as her present, I would pay for all her expenses (flights, hotel, activities etc).Moving onto the incident, I have an autistic 9 year old son. Quarantine has been really hard for him, and he's been struggling a lot.One thing he loves to do is jigsaw puzzles. We decided to get him 10,000 piece jigsaw as a small gift for him to complete.He has a table in his room in which he laid everything out and spent almost a month on this puzzle.A few days ago, he completed the puzzle and was just so happy and poud of himself. He facetimed his grandparents and other relatives just to show them his hard work.Anyways, later during the day I hear him scream and I rush upstairs to see him bent over his puzzle which was now in pieces on the floor, and my daughter filming on her phone.Long story short is that there is a tiktok trend of siblings throwing jigsaw puzzles on the floor. My daughter decided to film one, and went into his room and shoved the puzzle off his desk and recorded his reaction.My son was inconsolable and it took us almost 3 hours to calm him down. However he is still so upset. I was furious with my daughter and we had a long talk. No matter what excuse she gives, her actions were complete malicious. She did apologise to her brother. However I don't understand what positive outcome she saw from this. After some time I decided her punishment would be that she would not be allowed to go on this trip. I told her that I would not pay for her trip and cancelled her flight and hotel reservations. She started crying and begging me to reconsider, but I told her that I already cancelled everything. I told she was too old for this type of horrible behaviour and she had to deal with the consequences of her actions.She  packed her stuff and left to her mothers house (my ex-wife). I later got a call from her mother saying, that I was a horrible parent and that my punishment was just an overreaction. I'm starting to think maybe I did over-react considering she had been begging for a girls trip for the past 2 years. Yet she decided a few like was more important than her brothers feelings.So Reddit aita?",467,274,2020-07-11 15:25:22
572,YTA,"AITA for leaving my shoes in the kitchen, and asking my mom not to put them on my bed?","Every morning, i (16f) leave for swim practice, and come home through the garage. My house is built so the garage door leads into the kitchen. When coming home, I leave my shoes underneath the counter. Mom has told me multiple times that she would rather me not do that, but it's a bad habit of mine. I keep forgetting to put them where she wants them, but when I'm reminded I apologize and put them away.Yesterday, my mom decided to take it upon herself to put my shoes away. Except, she put them on my bed. Muddy soles down. First of all, for a woman who yells at me about 'disrespecting my belongings' at least once a week, this is mildly hypocritical. Aside from that, I really just don't like it when shoes are on my bed, especially when they're dirty. I have to wash my sheets again, and i can't do that every time because i only have 2 sets of sheets for my bed. I understand that the easiest way to get this to stop is to not put my shoes in the kitchen, but this has happened before when i put my shoes by the stairs, and again when i had 'too many shoes downstairs'.I asked my mom to not put them on my bed. Honestly, I was a little frustrated at the time, so my tone might not have been the nicest. She took my tone to be rude, and yelled at me for being 'disrespectful'. Mom told me I have to think of how SHE feels when she trips over my shoes (now that I think about it, there's no way for her to trip over my shoes I put them UNDER the counter). I tried to stay calm and continue to talk to her in a polite way, but i guess my tone wasn't polite enough, and she got more upset.The conversation escalated and she threatened to ground me for a month, take away my phone, take away my license, not let me swim , etc. Now, normally when she starts punishing me I have three general options. I can: a) be quite, and have her yell at me for ignoring her, b) say ""ok"" and ""got it"" to acknowledge i'm hearing her, and be yelled at for having 'attitude', or c) cry and fight back, and get yelled at for disrespecting her authority and acting like a child. I chose option b this time.The conversation escalated, and we both started yelling at each other. I mentioned how mature she was acting, and that pushed it further. Eventually, we quieted down.Fast forward to today, I tried talking to her again. All I want is for her not to put my shoes on my bed. She could literally do anything else to put my shoes on my bed, and I would be fine. So I calmly asked if she could maybe try another way of reminding me. She said no, she's been telling me for months not to do that, ,and she's tired of it (its been 3 weeks since practice started again, so that's a bit of an exaggeration). I left the room so i wouldn't yell at her.all I want is for her to not put my shoes on my bed, but AITA for leaving them in the kitchen in the first place?Edit: thanks guys. I think I knew i was TA, i just needed to hear it from someone other than my family. All the suggestions on how to help the situation were really appreciated!",59,79,2020-07-13 14:35:05

She has been left with a multitude of issues to work through that her neurologist said may get better with time or not. One of her many issues is memory loss. She had a lot of tough times because of this (friends, family, and when she went back to work). Something she found that worked for her was carrying a small journal with her at all times. It started when she went back to work (vet field) and had to figure out how to remember things the Dr.'s were telling her. She works ER so it's quite hectic and stressful at times and she almost quit before deciding to write everything down.&#x200B;And when I say everything, I mean it. Now that she has that journal she carries it everywhere. Even outside of work. We're joining friends at a bar? Journal. Dinner with my parents? Journal. One of our friends states something?

341,ESH,AITA for not including my daughter's boyfriend in my family portrait?,"Context: Every year I like to get a portrait taken of my family in the summer and then hang them above my stairs since I love looking at them as I walk up and down the stairs ( looking at them really is the best part of my day lol). I told my kids ( I have 4) that even when they're adults , I would like them (with their kids and spouses) to take the photo with me , but I have always the rule that boyfriends and girlfriends don't count as family so they can't be in the portrait.Conflict: my daughter Paige (24) is has a 5 year old son with a man who she has been off and on with since then (they have been  ""solidly together"" for the past 2 years). So I was texting with my family about when we can take the picture  and get our families together. This spurred Paige to ask me (she and her son live with me) if this year if we could include her boyfriend in the picture because he ""feels"" left out since she and their son are in the pictures but he's never been invited. I told her no because I don't want non married partners in it since they're not family. This is when she got nasty with me and said that wasn't fair to her and her partner because """"they don't believe in marriage"""" so he'll be always be discluded and that I just have this arbitrary rule because I don't like them.  This may be where I become TA because at this point I got nasty with her back and said along the lines of t I had that rule to prevent her bringing a different guy every year into the photo (Paige has always been... Well... Promiscuous so to speak). This caused her to storm off and is now refusing to take the photo at all with her son.This really grinds me gears because I let her and her son (my grandchild) live in my house rent free and she can't even do this one fucking thing for me without ruining it. I just want to add that my other kids  didn't include their partners into the photo until marriage so it's not just for her.AITA?Edit: I just want to add that while my husband agrees with me, my other kids think I should include Paige's boyfriend.",289,142,2020-07-10 15:11:57

Me (M38) and my girlfriend of 2.5 years (""A"" 35) have recently decided that she and her daughter (""K."" 13) were going to move into my apartment. We are planning on moving into an actual house in 2021 or early 2022, but my apartment will have to make do for the time being. K. Wasn't happy about that, but reluctantly complied in the end. I was never close with K., we do not interact with each other a lot, but I think we're both pretty content with that, as she doesn't show any further interest in me whatsoever. That's ok.Now that we live together, me and A's daughter have been experiencing some.... problems. The main one being that she keeps going into my fridge, taking everything & anything she pleases without asking or informing me in any sort of way. I do most of the cooking and virtually all of the shopping in my household, so I find it to be very infuriating to find that some of my ingredients are just being eaten without my knowledge. I tried to talk to her about it and she told me that I'm being ridiculous, since neither me or her mom even cook dinner (which is part of my current lifestyle) and she doesn't get to eat the lunch I cook because she's at school (She refuses to eat any leftovers so I stopped cooking extra).  Basically, she wants me to buy her enough groceries so she can feed herself, which I am not willing to, as I do not want to spend any more money on the abundance of groceries that I already am, which is more than enough, mind you. All I want from her is to tell me about the ingredients that she's taking, or better, ask me about taking them. She left the conversation without saying another word, and instead complained to her mother about me.A. is mad at me because I do not make her daughter feel at home and try to control and restrict her. (A. is very lenient in her parenting methods and does NOT see where I am coming from)  K is apparently very sad about the move and misses being close to her friends (which she also brings over without my permission). This doesn't change anything for me, though.  I told her that there's no way that I'm spending extra money on her daughter and she can feed her herself if she isn't on board with the rules that I have in my house. I feel like I'm going crazy.

Both have graduated from college, but are currently living with me due to the situation and such. Neither have jobs since they both got laid off at the beginning of all of this. I'm happy to have them both back at the house, it was getting lonely since my husband passed not to long ago. I had saved up roughly 50k for each for college. My one kid, who we'll call J, and my other kid, who we'll call S, are twins. J got a scholarship that covered most of her school expenses, but I paid for rent, food, etc. I was super proud of her. S also went to college, though she didn't get a scholarship, which I was fine with. I was also super proud of her. I didn't want either of them to start out life with a bunch of student loans, so I was happy to pay for both of them since I could afford to do so. S also worked part-time to help pay.Now that they are both out of jobs and living with me, J has started asking about the rest of her ""rightly deserved money"". She wants it, I don't know if its to save or spend, but she claims that its not her fault she got a scholarship and that I didn't have to pay as much for her as her sister. I was planning on either doing renovations, possibly moving (my house is kinda big now that its just me), or going on a vacation in a few months (depending how things go) with the money. Obviously, after they both move out and get new jobs. I told her this and she got super mad. She kept going on and on about how it was her money. S stepped in and said that she should be grateful for all the help I've given both of them. Now J is mad at me and S and J are fighting. Was I wrong for not giving her the money? Should I give her the money?I'll also add that I've not asked either to pay rent, food, etc while they have been living with me. So, whatever money they had at the begging before their job loss, they should still have most of.&#x200B;Edit: I didn't tell her I have $x for her. I told them I would be able to help with college (I didn't tell them i'd completely pay for it either, since I know I didn't save up enough if they wanted to go to those 100k+ colleges). I'm also pretty sure S told J that I was paying for her college, so that might be why she thinks she's owed money since didn't pay for her college. ",215,50,2020-07-10 00:52:50
659,NAH,AITA for agreeing to be a maid of honor and then backing out?,"This happened a couple years ago, but its something I find myself thinking about from time to time. I was good friends with a girl, Amy, in high school. After high school we went to the same college, and we remained friends throughout the first year. During our second year, Amy met a new boyfriend. Amy was always the kind of girl that would ditch her friends for whoever she was dating, and this was no different. After she met her boyfriend I barely saw her. While this bothered me in high school, by this point I was used to it and had made other friends. Amy and I drifted apart and pretty much stopped talking. After college I moved away for graduate school. I moved back home after graduation and Amy and I reconnected. At this point we hadnt spoken beyond a casual social media happy holidays hope all is well in about 5 years. She asked me to grab lunch with her one afternoon, and I accepted. At lunch, she told me that her boyfriend (the same one she met while we were in college) had proposed. She then asked me to be her maid of honor. I was shocked. We had barely spoken in 5 years. But I said yes. I absolutely shouldnt have said yes, but I was so taken aback I didnt know what to do. I should mention that at this point in my life, I had been applying to PhD programs. A few weeks after accepting the maid of honor offer, I found out I was accepted into a PhD program, starting in a few months (before the wedding). The program was halfway across the country and intensive. I called Amy and told her that because I would be moving and starting this program, I didnt think it would be right for me to serve as maid of honor. Amy sounded hurt, but said she understood. I still feel terribly about it. While everything I said about the PhD program was true, the real reason I bailed was because I felt uncomfortable. I had never even met her fianc. I didnt know anyone else in the bridal party. I felt very under qualified to fill this huge role. So Reddit, am I an asshole?",41,20,2020-07-10 03:12:26

Everyone he lives with at his house tested positive and are fighting the virus. I have been working throughout the entire pandemic because I am an essential worker. I have been stressed beyond belief, sometimes clocking 60 hours a week. Quarantine is in quotes because Im still working everyday but hes staying with me because we are negative. I get tested regularly. I also have been balancing online college courses at the same time. My boyfriend worked a couple times a week before the pandemic and was laid off a few months ago. He makes a good amount of unemployment benefits right now. More than what he made while working.I wake up everyday for work before 8 am and come come around 6-7 every day. I am tired. My boyfriend cleans when I ask him to, does chores, and has helped buy groceries because he has state benefits. Thats in quotes because its not really coming out of his pocket. We argued when I asked him for $75 to help with the electric bill because he is at home running the A/C while Im gone. But he gave it to me. My boyfriend always sleeps past noon. This irritates me even though he does chores. I am starting to get resentful that he sleeps in everyday and when confronted he states that he has cleaned/vacuumed/did the dishes, errands, etc and thinks that it is enough. I am resentful that he stays at my house all day and when the 1st comes around I still have to pay the whole rent. I dont think that doing chores and errands is a sufficient trade off. I feel as though he should pitch in on the rent and he should also want to pitch in. Am I an asshole? I love him to death. But I just feel like this is becoming inequitable. I want him to stay with me because it lowers our risk VS staying where he lives where 4 people are still positive.

387,NAH,AITA for euthanizing my roommates cat without permission?,"Title sounds awful, I know, but I promise its a bit more complicated than that.My roommate (Charlie) and I (both 22) have two cats. Mine is a younger cat who I adopted a few years ago when we first got a place together. Charlie brought his childhood cat (Ralph) when he moved in. If i had to guess, I think Ralph would be around 16 or 17. Charlie had to rush home out of state for a family emergency, leaving me in charge of both cats for the week. Ralph was frail in his old years and required a lot of special care, but Ive cared for elderly cats in the past. He seemed more lethargic than usual for the first couple of days, but I assumed he just missed his dad and continued to care for him as normal. The fourth morning, Ralph had a seizure. I had no idea what to do. I tried calling Charlie again and again but no answer. Thankfully Ralph stopped seizing, but he was clearly sick and out of it. I wasnt getting any response from Charlie, so I decided to call our vet instead. While I was on the phone Ralph had another short seizure. They told me to bring him in right away, so I packed him up in my car and floored it to the clinic. While I was driving he had another seizure, this one lasting a couple of minutes, and it was one of the most terrifying couple of minutes of my life. I got Ralph to the vet and by this point it was clear he was fading. His eyes were empty looking and he couldnt lift his head. I was absolutely distraught at this point, sobbing and begging for help. The vet looked him over and gave him seizure meds for my sake but she suggested we euthanize him that morning. At his age, it wasnt likely he was able to recover from whatever was causing the seizures and Id only be causing him pain by keeping him around. I tried calling Charlie a few more times. Finally I gave up and sent him a text telling him what was up and how sorry I was. Ralph had suffered another seizure since arriving at the clinic and I knew it was time to let him go. It was very peaceful, just like he fell asleep in my arms. I paid for his remains to be cremated and ordered a lovely little urn to store his ashes. Surprisingly, I never got a text or call from Charlie. Instead, I woke up at 1 AM to him storming in and screaming at me for killing his cat. He drove all day to get here. Hes extremely upset and feels that I should have waited for him to respond before giving the OK to the vet. I told him that I tried to contact him many times before and after Ralph died, but I have to admit that hes right I did euthanize his cat without his consent and that was a pretty shitty thing to do. However, I maintain that I acted with Ralphs best interest in mind.Charlie stormed out to crash on a friends couch and I havent heard from him since. I feel guilty, but some part of me still believes his response is unwarranted. Im trying to find a way to send him Ralphs urn and ashes as a sort of olive branch, but I think Ive damaged our friendship beyond repair. AITA?",280,119,2020-07-15 16:43:20

I got all of my pets when I moved out a year ago, and ever since I moved out, my sister (6) has been begging my mom to let her have a hamster. My mom eventually agreed, under the condition that my sister would be responsible with the hamster, and she would not be allowed to give him away if she got bored of him. Inevitably, my sister did get sick of Hamilton hamster. She's 6 for God's sake, of course a child is going to get sick of cleaning out his cage, feeding him, watching him while he roams, etc. I feel like this is my mom's fault for refusing any care of Hamilton. I do think kids should have responsibility, but I don't think it's fair for a young kid's first responsibility to be a whole little life. So, recently I've started spending weekends with my parents because I've missed them loads, and I've found myself spending most of the weekend with Hamilton. He is a very friendly hamster if you know how to handle them. My sister obviously does not, and Hamilton bites her every time she puts her hand in the cage. I tried to teach her how to handle him properly, but she told me she hates him and just wants him to go away. I've been going for three weeks, and every week his cage has been gross and I've cleaned it. I've bought him more engaging pieces for his cage. I even bought him a new cage a few days before the incident occured. So, my sister cracked the cage hoping Hamilton would escape. She owned up to it straight away to my mom and I, saying that she 'knows hamsters can live fine in fields' and that he hates her so he'd be happier anyway. My mom sent my sister to her room. We found Hamilton after about two hours of searching, and I told my mom she needs to rehome Hamilton. I offered to take him. She kicked up a fuss, saying that my sister has to take care of him, no matter how shitty that care is. She said my sister's life lesson is more important than Hamilton's life. So, later that night I took it upon myself to take Hamilton back to my house. I told my sister about my plan, and she was pretty happy with it. My mom was not. She's furious with me for taking Hamilton, and I don't care. I think the life lesson of treating animals kindly is more important than her awful attempt at teaching responsibility.

He's very open about it, makes jokes about it, and it isn't an off-limits topic when we're roasting and joking with him.When he's about to have a particularly scary manic episode, he hallucinates a man wearing a suit and horse mask like [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/2ntVgyUeEWKJzRfH6) It's quite a funny image, but apparently it's what he sees before he goes into hours/ days of manic hallucinations (which happen every few months). He jokes about it often, but it was obviously a scary sight to him. He sees it looking through glass panels in doors, at the foot of his bed, etc. Earlier today, I (22M) was in the supermarket and saw a mask very similar to the ones he'd described hallucinating, and I considered sebding him a photo like ""look what I just saw"" (he would definitely have been cool with that). However, I thought again, and I purchased it (it was cheap).When I got home, I put on my suit jacket, put the horse mask in my car, and drove the 5 minutes to my friends house, where he lives with his dad and girlfriend. I put on the mask, and popped up at their window. He and his girlfriend were sat watching TV. I expected him to freak out for a second, and then I'd pull the mask off. Then maybe have some socially distanced drinks through the window. Harmless prank, I thought. So he sees me, freaks out for a second, asks his girlfriend if she can see me too (expecting her to say no), and she looks scared and says she can. He starts FREAKING OUT big time. He thinks she's part of his manic episode. I pull the mask off, expecting him to calm down, but I can only describe his expression as one of absolute terror when he actually saw my face. He apparently thought he was hallucinating me too. Long story short, it took us about 15 minutes to convince him it was only a prank and he wasn't hallucinating or paranoid.When he accepted that I was really me, and that his girlfriend could really see me too, he was incredibly angry and upset (as was his girlfriend) that I'd ""tried to induce a manic episode"". That wasn't my intention. I intended for him to jump, be scared for a moment, and then laugh as I took the mask off. They asked me to leave and said what I did was ""fucked up"" and that I was a terrible friend. I disagree. I wouldn't have done what I did if I had anticipated his reaction, and while I'm sorry it happened, I don't think I should be accused of trying to induce a manic episode when I was actually trying to pull a prank.So, reddit, AITA?",20,42,2020-07-10 20:36:04

As well as his 24 year old brother who is autistic, though I did not know that at the time !I was talking to one of his friends that Im not too familiar with, and she brought up a story about an autistic child who passed away a couple years ago as it was related to the protests going on. I then said that was tragic and that I hope they come up with a way to do prenatal testing for autism, so that people dont have to suffer with it in the future.My boyfriends brother heard this conversation and came over to us who, again I did not know was autistic. He was very angry and called me a eugenicist in front of everyone, and said that he hoped that prenatal testing never existed because of people like me. I felt embarrassed with this happening in front of everyone else and left. I later asked my boyfriend why he didnt tell me his brother had autism, because I wouldnt have said anything like that if I knew. He said he shouldnt have had to tell me because I shouldnt hold those beliefs at all. He said it was very disappointing knowing that I thought like that and that I owed his brother an apology and a renunciation of my views. I disagreed and after a little bit of squabbling he just said lets forget about he whole thing.The reason why Im asking now is that I saw his brother yesterday and he still wont talk to me for more than a few sentences, which is progress but far too slow for my taste, so maybe I should apologize.

198,YTA,AITA for coming out at my sister's engagement party?,"My sister and her partner of 8 years just got engaged. He proposed 4 weeks ago and their engagement party was last night. I am a lesbian and just realised my sexuality a few months ago. I have been seeing a girl and I am at the point where I want to show her off to everybody. Anyway, I brought my girlfriend to my sister's engagement party and everyone thought she was just my friend. During the dinner I came out as lesbian and explained to everyone my friend is actually my girlfriend. Everything seemed fine but my sister's were pissed at me. I later found out everyone thought I was a piece of Shit to come out as my sister's engagement and thought it was for attention. AITA?",1074,438,2020-07-09 13:57:25
170,NAH,AITA for calling my sister disgusting after she threw a party to celebrate our moms death?,"I just want to say first that yes, my mother was a crappy mom to us. She had undiagnosed, untreated, bipolar. She was never physical but she was volatile. During her depressive times she could be straight up neglectful. Our dad was the MVP during our childhood and was responsible for most of our care.All that said, my sister and I both had a pretty different relationship with her after she was diagnosed. The timeline goes like this: Sister moves out at 18, I move out a year later, also 18, both of us go low contact with our mother.When sister is 21 and I am 20, our mother finally gets diagnosed and starts treatment. She starts weekly therapy and is put on medication. Her mood stabilizes and she becomes a very different person (In a good way).Mother apologizes to us both, I accept it, sister does not. Fast forward 6 years. I have a really good relationship with our mom, sister talks to her maybe once a year. 6 months ago, Mom gets diagnosed with ovarian cancer, stage 4. She already had pretty poor health and declined very quickly. She died 2 weeks ago.We didnt have a funeral but my sister, our dad, and me got together for a night and had our own service. Last night I get a video call from my sister and she is absolutely plastered. I see that she has a couple friends over and they are drinking. I asked her whats up and she starts singing that song Ding Dong the Witch is Dead and her friends are joining in the background. I asked her what the fuck and she start going on this drunk rant. Basically, she threw a party to celebrate our moms death. She absolutely unloaded on me about how happy she was that mom was dead and how she deserved it for how shit a mom she was.I couldnt take it and hung up. I sent her a very long message about what a disgusting, hateful person she was. That mom tried for years to make it up to us and she rejected her at every turn. I loved my mom and her death is an absolute tragedy in my eyes. For my sister to actually celebrate it is beyond fucked up to me. Not to mention hugely disrespectful to me and our dad, who are both actively grieving.She read the message this morning and basically told me to fuck off, that she didnt own our mom anything, and that I can get the fuck out of her life. Im just angry and sad. I said some harsh things to her but I dont really regret it, as I do think what she did was horrible. I just got off the phone with a close friend of mine, who I told the story too. She thinks that I should have more empathy for my sister. I dont really agree since my sister clearly doesnt have any empathy for me.So, I need some more opinions before I make any decisions here. Was I the asshole to my sister or was she the asshole to me?Tldr: Sister threw a party to celebrate our moms death and called to tell me about it. I told her off in a very harsh way.",1496,609,2020-07-11 17:21:00
877,YTA,AITA for kicking my sister out our dad's house because she's wasn't planning on leaving?,"Basically my dad has gone on a 5 year spiritual journey in Tibet. Honestly I don't what that actually entails and why it would take 5 years but great for him. He contacts us every two months or so for a check up and since he'll be gone for so long, he left me in charge of the house. Cool, it's better than paying rent and it's a nice house so I didn't mind and moved in with my gf. A couple months ago my sister was laid off so she and her fiance (then boyfriend) asked to stay till they were up on their feet. Didn't mind that either since she's my sister and all so I let them in. It's been fun and they have been contributing their share but it wasn't supposed to be permanent. Last week while we were celebrating the 4th, her fiance proposed to her with a replica of our mother's ring. Awesome, another thing to celebrate. The next morning we were chilling outside and I asked him how he managed to find a replica and he said that he couldn't find one so he got it made especially for her. Over $7500. A large amount of money to spend for someone who's partner got laid off. I spoke to my gf and we were discussing what to do when the two off them started talking about them getting married later this year and having children soon after. That's when I subtly asked where they're planning to move to after the wedding and she just laughed and said there's a ton of space here so there's no problem revolving living situation. This kinda pissed me off but I tried to be civil and said eventually they'll need to move out because we also needed space. She said something about it not being my decision to make it being dad's house and that she'll stay until dad says otherwise (funny that my decision only mattered when it was about letting her stay with us but anyways. So I gave her two weeks to move out which she didn't take seriously at all. Luckily her fiance understands and he told me that they'll be gone by next week even. I love my sister but not enough to share the house with her and her up and coming family. So am I the asshole for kicking out my sister?",19,15,2020-07-10 19:52:40
331,YTA,"Aita for being mad at my girlfriends outfit at a music festival, and staying upset until she changed?","Clear throwaway, Im bored at work so I wanna post this issue I had with my gf last year, as it caused a bit of a divide amongst friends who had different opinions on the subject. Im from Chicago, a 19 year old male, and have been going to a certain very popular music festival in the city. Such a bummer we wont have any festivals this year, but it is what it is. This is pretty self explanatory from the title but Ill get into it a bit. Last year I went with a group of friends including my girlfriend and we stayed in a hotel. My gf was one of those girls who wanted to go to the festival in shorts and a bra as her shirt. I wasnt a big fan of it when she came out of the bathroom in the hotel room in her outfit. First I didnt feel like 5 of my guy friends needed to see my gf in just her underwear. I also dont mean to sound like a square, and Im not saying I want my gf to dress like a nun, but I didnt feel it was a ridiculous ask to want her to atleast have a shirt on. I told her politely that I didnt love her outfit choice, and she just brushed me off and called me a jerk. She hit me with the classic  I wear bikinis whats the difference and I tried to explain myself and she wasnt having any of it. We were pregaming in the hotel for about an hour and I was being a bit distant from her. Distant enough to where she threw a top on because she didnt want to argue throughout the day. I thanked her and that was it with that. It was fine until some of her friends called me an asshole for making her change which she did on her own. They just went on to me about how theyd never let a boyfriend dictate what they wear to a concert. My guy friends were more on my side, claiming they wouldnt have loved it either. Am I the asshole in this situation?",327,310,2020-07-13 16:53:38
131,NTA,AITA for cutting out my friend because they reported me for bullying ,"Now I know the title seems harsh, but hear me out.Me and my best friend of about 14 years (lets call her Amy) are as a close as two peas in a pod. Because of this, we like to think of ways that we could roast each other.  Now I want to make a few things clear: 1. There are strict boundaries about what we do and do not joke about (for example it is more than fine to take a piss out of my nose, but the death of my granpa is a no-no zone.)2. If a joke hurt one of us, we express that, which is usually followed by a apology and a talk about boundaries if the person wishes to do so.3. All of our mutual friends know it and pay it no mind.Recently, a new person came into out group (lets call them Alex). Theyve been introduced to out group dynamics, and theyre been told about Amys and mine banter.Its all been fun and games, however one day I get an email from my head of my class to come and talk to her. I went, and apparently someone reported me for bullying Amy. This took a good week to solve, and both me and Amy had to have numerous conversations with head of class to prove that its all chill. I did go to Amy, I asked if I did anything to hurt her. She said noNext time , were sitting in a group, Im telling the story, and Alex says yeah it might have been meI got very mad , cause their behavior caused both of us a bunch of trouble. Alex said that they do not like our jokes, so theyve decided to report me just in case I was hurting Amy.I have decided to cut them out, but some friends think that Im being to harsh.AITA?",2315,178,2020-07-11 09:23:09
92,ESH,AITA for not adopting my wife's child?,"I (27M) used to have a wonderful relationship with the woman I love (26F). However, five years ago, she got drunk, had a one night stand, and got pregnant from it. Can't be mine, I can't have kids due to a horseback riding injury when I was a teen. Didnt get the guys name, no way to find him, so he's out of the picture. My wife decided to keep it, and we almost went through a divorce, but couples therapy made us decide to try again. We're still in therapy now, since I still have a hard time trusting her. So, she had her son. We talked a lot about it, and I made it clear that I'm ok taking on a step-parent role, but I wasnt willing to fully be his dad. I wouldnt adopt him, but I would help raise him and get him off to college. My wife agreed to this, became a stay at home mom so she could take care of him with help from her parents, and I've pretty much been the fun uncle like guy. I play with him, buy him games, try my best to not resent him (and I am in therapy for this), and mostly just stay out of the way of my wife's parenting. He even calles me ""Uncle,"" instead of dad. He knows I'm not his father, and is just happy to play video games with me and chill. Well, recently, my wife has started talking about me adopting him, something I'm not willing to do. I made it clear that if anything happened, he would go live with her parents, and I'd send child support. If they couldn't take him, I wouldnt put him in foster care or anything, but I also wasnt willing to take on the responsibility of being his father when I'm not. I'm happy being an Uncle to another man's kid, since thats what life threw at me. This has greatly upset her, and she's trying to find a way to force me into adopting him. She's even been manipulating the poor kid, saying he should start calling me dad instead of uncle like he has his entire life, which is upsetting and confusing the poor boy. This situation has worked for the last 5 years, and I dont know why she's trying to change something that isnt broken, or force me into a role I told her years ago I wasnt willing to accept, which she was fine with until just recently.Update - after reading everything, I told my wife I was leaving and pursuing that divorce. I think I've been ready to do so for a while, but just needed the push. This has led to a complete melt down, but I stayed firm, packed everything up, and moved in with my brother across town. I have already contact the landlord to tell him I would pay for 2 more months rent. After that, everything needs to be switched to her. Talking to my lawyer, it was verified that, due to the process I went through after the birth to establish I wasnt the father, I would not have to pay child support or alimony, which is something very rare and uncommon anyway where I live. He's already working on the paperwork. No idea when it'll all happen, but once it does I'll cut full contact. My wife has tried to call and text multiple times, but I've refused to talk. I'll post another update when I know more.",3837,1173,2020-07-15 01:05:47
921,YTA,AITA for making my boyfriend work for an extra year instead of going to university,"Me (21) and my boyfriend (22) have been dating for nearly two years now and we live together. Hes always talking about going to university and he finally got into an access to higher education course, to start in September. However, Im making him defer another year again.For the last year or so hes been really struggling financially, to the extent where he owes me over 3000. Ive always helped him out as I come from a financially stable family and have felt bad. Its not his fault, hes just been messed over by the coronavirus and switching jobs at the wrong time, resulting in him not being able to claim furlough or universal credit due to my earnings. Him starting in September would mean he wouldnt be working full time in order to pay me back and because the college course isnt a degree, he wouldnt be able to get a student loan.He is very upset about it as hes 22 and thinks 23 is too late to start university. But I know for a fact that I will have to cover for him again for the next year and I just dont want to pay for him anymore. Plus my mum and dad are getting upset about it too. Am I the asshole for making him defer his dreams just to pay me back?",18,10,2020-07-09 20:24:08
103,NAH,AITA for not paying for my bisexual daughter's wedding?,"My husband and I have two children, Sara (35) and Samuel (29). When both our kids got engaged, we gave them a choice. We would pay for a small wedding and give money towards a house. Or we would pay for them to have a big wedding and nice honeymoon. My daughter Sara got married at 20 to her high school sweetheart. They took us up on the small wedding offered and were happily married for 8 years before our son-in-law passed away. After his passing, she announced that she was bisexual and that she was now dating a women named Laura. Initially we were shocked and, admittedly, a bit disappointed. But after taking the time to get to know Laura we realized that she was a good person, great with our grandchildren, and made our daughter happy. They got engaged this Christmas and we couldn't be happier. We have accepted her into the family as one of our own.My son Samuel married a girl from church this January. When he got engaged they chose to have a big wedding as they already have a place to live. The wedding was a grand and quite a lovely event.While there, we were sitting with Sara and Laura. Sara started talking about how this time around, she would take us up on the big wedding. I asked her what she was talking about, and she referred to our deal.I told her that the deal was a one time offer, and that we are done paying for weddings. She got very angry and accused my husband and I of being homophobic. She said if she was marrying another man, then we would happily pay for the wedding.This is not the case at all. And if our son were to remarry, we would tell him the same thing. We paid virtually the same amount for both of them to get started out and feel that we have done our part to be fair.Sara and Laura ended up leaving early that night, and have been cold towards us ever since. I honestly feel like we have done nothing wrong, but need to know. Reddit, AITA?",4934,588,2020-07-15 17:32:30
709,YTA,AITA for forcing my girlfriend to take out a loan to repair my car?,"My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) have been dating for 2 years. Were have a strong relationship and its something I would love to progress further. Due to growing up and attending uni in London, my girlfriend doesnt have a driving license. I do as I grew up in the countryside. Last month we were driving from her parents house back to our flat. It was nighttime, on a single lane road and it was lightly raining, nothing I was uncomfortable driving in. As I turned a corner I distinctly remember slowing down, so much so that I dropped into 4th gear, and then suddenly a deer ran out and across the road. My girlfriend screamed, grabbed the steering wheel and pulled it left (right hand drive) which ended up steering us off the road and into a tree. Totalling the car and setting off the airbags. Of course our initial thoughts were on safety so we exited the car and called emergency services and her parents. We got a lift back to her parents and that was that. The next morning I questioned what we were going to do about the car. Apparently its your car, so you can just buy a new one. As if I had 5k just lying in the bank. She also claimed that it was my fault for driving too fast so I reminded her about dropping a gear. Unfortunately for my girlfriend I drive her to work every morning and then pick her up on the way back from my job, so without me she has no way of commuting.I very clearly told her that she would be paying for the new car as it was her who drove us off the road. She started crying because she doesnt have enough money and would need to take out a loan at the bank. I told her she had one month to find 5k or I would seriously reassess our relationship and take it to petty claims court. (We are both furloughed and expecting to start working again before the end of the month.) Well the month is up tomorrow so-Reddit, AITA for forcing my girlfriend to take out a loan to replace my car that she crashed?Edit: car is (was) worth 5000 Edit: yes I have insurance but the claim for towing the car, scrapping and then losing my no claims will also be a significant cost. Ive had to go through insurance before for a claim that wasnt my fault and it was a massive pain in the ass. Edit: I do not think I would have hit the deer as it was traveling across the road and I was going slowly enough to miss it. The sight of it scared her into acting quickly.",33,65,2020-07-09 22:51:47
713,NTA,AITA for not wanting to take down my wedding picture with my sister's now ex-husband in it?,"I got married in October 2018. The photo in question has me, my husband, our kids, all of our siblings, their kids, our parents, and everyone's dates. The term ""dates"" includes my dad's girlfriend, my step dad, my 2 brother in laws (including the one in the title), my sister in law, my brother's fiancee (now wife), my husband's brother in law, and my husband's brother's girlfriend.I hired my friend from uni, who is also a photographer, for the wedding photos. Of the staged photos, there are no photos without the non-blood relatives. Everyone mentioned in the first paragraph was in the family photo, then there were additional photos with just the wedding party, just my family, just his family, just us and the kids, etc. Point is, there are no photos that include our entire families that don't also include the in laws.We got copies of pretty much every photo, and most of them are in our photo albums but the one with us and the kids, plus the group shot of everyone in the first paragraph, are now on display in our home, plus our parents and siblings asked for specific photos, which we got them. The respective families wanted the ones with just their side, which included all the in laws, and all 3 sets of parents asked for a photo of us and the kids.But now my sister has divorced her husband. I've asked what happened, she's not talking about it, but she came over earlier and on seeing the group photo asked me why I still have it up. I told her it's my wedding photo, with my family in, of course I still have it up. Then she asks me why I haven't gotten him photoshopped out when I got my mother in law photoshopped and I said that wasn't the same thing (my mother in law wore a white dress so the photographer changed it to green) and that I wasn't going to send it back nearly 2 years later to get rid of her husband. Then my sister asked why I hadn't put something over his face, and at that point I just flat out told her she was being ridiculous, at one point in time he was family, and frankly I have bigger things to worry about than her ex husband being in my wedding photo.She left upset, and later I got a call from my mother, essentially saying that my sister is heartbroken over her divorce and me having that reminder in my home and that plus how I snapped at her isn't making it easier. Mum then admitted she took down her group photo and just left up the one of me, my husband, and the kids, to make things easier for my sister. I asked my siblings if they'd done the same and if I was in the wrong here, and while one was on my side, the other basically said that me expecting them to keep the photo despite my sister's heartbreak was bordering bride-zilla despite it being nearly 2 years post-wedding.AITA?",32,31,2020-07-13 22:59:06
