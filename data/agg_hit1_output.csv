0,1,"AITA for taking (28M+28M) our ""big scary dogs"" to the groomer and complaining to the owner afterwards, resulting in the newest hire getting fired?","Me: 28M
Fiance/Husband to be: 28M

Dogs in question:

- Nougat, 7 year old brownish Newfoundlander (75kg/165Ib)
- Olli, 5 year old Basset Hound (32kg/71Ib)
- Pongo, 7 month old Saint Bernhard, longhaired variant (50kg/110Ib)

We've frequented this doggy barbershop every 3 months for 10 years, because it 1) helped with the hair in the home, 2) socialized the dogs and 3) my dogs tend to get pretty smelly around the 3 month mark. 4) we're too ""lazy"" to do it ourselves, so might as well get one of the locals some more business!

Anyway - our dogs are very well behaved, don't bark, don't jump on people (stb hubby is a certified dog trainer) and we can have them off-leash when we're on our 2 daily walks, well except for Pongo seeing as he's still a puppy.

Well.. during lockdown and all other stuff that has happened, one of the groomers in the salon sadly died. They hired a new one recently.. we had a booked appointment and when she saw the dogs, she told us to GTFO because

- 1. The dogs don't need grooming in form of a shower, because they are not ""show dogs"".
- 2. They are ""too big"" (I get it, Nougat and Pongo can seem intimidating, but I swear on Thors hammer, that the most dangerous things they can do, are nuclear farts and drool... much drool). She outright told us, that the dogs were a ""hazard""... while they were sleeping like the fatbois they are.
- 3. We take up time from people with dogs that actually need the grooming.

Now, she wanted us to pay the full amount for ""wasting her time"", which we did - and then we complained to the owner afterwards - the owner who's previously groomed our newfie and our old 120kg/265Ib english mastiff (RIP Pongo I). While we told the owner that we didn't necessarily want her fired, we'd actually want her to just talk to the new employee, because ... business is business, right?

Turns out that she got fired, since this wasn't the first time.. since then, the employee has contacted me on FB and told me that I'm an asshole for ""getting her fired"", which in turn some of my friends agreed with and told us to had just taken our business elsewhere. Which, under normal circumstances I would've done, but we've been with this saloon for 10 years without problems.
