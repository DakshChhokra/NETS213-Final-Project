I love my daughter but she is very difficult and I can‚Äôt stand her fianc√©. I gave them a deadline to move out because I can‚Äôt take this anymore. 

They got into a massive fight the other day while my wife was out. I guess a pair of my wife‚Äôs underwear got in with their laundry and she thought he was cheating. I think the fact she immediately jumped to cheating shows how bad their relationship is.

She was waving the underwear around and I recognized them because they had a floral print but I just let this ridiculous fight go on. My wife came home after about thirty minutes and said they were hers. My wife asked if I didn‚Äôt realize they were hers and I accidentally laughed.

I assumed it would just be me, my sister, her husband, my nephews, and my parents. But turns out they also invited her husband‚Äôs side of the family. 

When it was time to get in the pool, I changed into my swim trunks and removed my shirt. But my sister stopped me before I came out their house and asked to keep my shirt on because of my scars. She was referring to the scars from when I had my top (chest) surgery. I‚Äôm a trans guy. Had started transitioning 8 yrs ago and my surgery was 4 years ago. My scars have already faded and they‚Äôre pretty well hidden under my pecs. You‚Äôd have to look really close to even notice. 

I‚Äôve been to their pool many times and she‚Äôs never said anything before so I was surprised. Every other guy including my dad were all shirtless in the pool. 

When I asked what the prob was with my scars she said she was uncomfortable with her in laws knowing I‚Äôm trans. My feelings were hurt but I was mainly pissed. She said she didn‚Äôt want her in laws to look at her differently if they found out about me. 

She told me not to make a big deal and to go with it. 

When she left, I went back inside to change because i wasn‚Äôt gonna go in the pool with a shirt on. I only had the one I came wearing because I didn‚Äôt expect her to ask me this. 

My mood was soured after that and I didn‚Äôt wanna be around her so I decided to leave. When I said bye to everyone they were all confused since I was only there less than an hour. My dad pulled me aside and asked why I was leaving early. 

I told him to ask my sister and left. An hour later my sister called me upset because she and my dad got into a fight. 

My parents were furious about what she told me and they ended up leaving early too. Now she‚Äôs angry at me for ruining the bbq and said I didn‚Äôt have to cause all this drama if I only did what she asked.

What she said hurt me and I was no longer in a mood to be around her or anyone else, but I didn‚Äôt mean for all that to happen. Am I the asshole for getting mad at her and basically ruining their day?",True,False,2020-07-12 06:47:52

When my wife got pregnant, she became increasingly paranoid that the dog would be a danger to the baby. She brought up rehoming, and I refused. She was an ""aggressive breed"", but she was trained. One day, she called me crying at work that the dog ran away and she couldn't run after her. I believed her. I looked for that dog for weeks. I finally just accepted it because we had to go to the hospital to welcome our child and there were just other pressing concerns.

It's been 5 years since then, and we now have three children. I've wanted to get a new dog, but the kids take a lot of energy and time. My wife has always had a new excuse not to get another dog. I found out recently that my dog didn't run away, my wife and her father took the dog to the pound while I was at work because her parents agreed with her about the dog being ""dangerous"".

I'm FURIOUS. She was MY dog, my BABY. She wasn't dangerous. I would never have agreed to that. She probably never got adopted. I'm honestly mad enough to consider a separation if not for the kids and practical reasons. I've told her that the only way to make it up even a little bit is for us to get a dog. She ultimately doesn't want a dog at all, and complained that she would have to do too much with it. I'm not planning to let up on this one this time.",True,False,2020-07-15 03:05:19

I have a 15 year old daughter and a 11 year old son from my first marriage. I also have a 15 year old stepdaughter.

My wife has always gotten along with my children very well and has gone above and beyond to integrate our families.

And although at first my daughter was very standoffish to my wife, my wife was eventually able to bond with her. Only then did we get married.

A few weeks ago, my daughter found my wife's diary that she had been writing to when we went to marital counseling before we got married. Both our first marriages were terrible so we were determined to do it right. I also was given a diary.

My daughter then proceeded to read everything and even take photographs of certain pages. She then posted the photographs on Facebook and called my wife a bunch of cruel names.

My wife had written a few things about how she wished I didn't have kids before we met so we could have had less issues dealing with my ex.

She also said how she hated that my daughter had picked up so many bad traits from my ex.

And the last thing related to my kids was that she said my ex was a terrible mother for weaponizing her kids.

I admit I was taken aback and upset that my wife had written these things because I knew my kids would be hurt.

But this was also a personal diary as part of a therapy exercise and the diary had been hidden in our closet.

My daughter even posted some very sensitive information about my wife dealing with her father who was an alcoholic.

My wife is inconsolable. A lot of my family and friends have turned on my wife because they think what she wrote was terrible.

I disagree. She wrote things that she was concerned would affect our marriage and the counseling actually helped us deal with having stepchildren. And it's not like I shared the same opinion about my ex.

I'm just so defeated. My daughter will no longer see me if my wife is around and won't step foot in our house. My son is following her lead. My wife has already apologized several times.

My ex has said she will be starting the process to reduce my custody and sue for defamation. I know she won't win the defamation case but I feel like custody will indeed switch. I'm very stressed out.

My daughter refused to take down the diary pages and insists she's in the right.

5,AITA for disinviting my brother to my wedding after he told me ‚Äúbeing gay is wrong‚Äù?,23315,Not the A-hole,1370,hqmqs3,1594699805.0,"Little backstory: I‚Äôve been out of the closet since I was 17, in 2007. When I came out, people in my family said some pretty hurtful things, which I totally expected, being from a southern Baptist family in... god, it hurts to admit this but.. Floridaüò´. But my older brother at the time seemed very receptive, surprisingly. He told me that if my Dad ever gave me any trouble, to call him and he‚Äôd talk to him. That was really the last time we talked about it. 

Flash forward 13 years (I‚Äôm 30) and I‚Äôm getting married to my fianc√© Scott next year in April (if covid so graciously allows). I started putting a package together of fun things from my brother And I‚Äôs childhood, all with the intention of asking him to be my best man. However, he called me two weeks ago, claiming he‚Äôs wanted to ‚Äútalk to me about this for a long time‚Äù

He went into the long tangent about how being gay is wrong and isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwhat god wants‚Äù. He said he thinks Scott is a nice guy and he loves me, but he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right that we‚Äôre getting married. It was quite a shock as Scott and I have stayed with him multiple times when we visit my hometown. To top it off (and what hurts perhaps the most), he said my three old niece, whom we ADORE, won‚Äôt be coming to the wedding because he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant to have to explain to her what was going on here‚Äù.

Notice he only said that SHE wasn‚Äôt coming to the wedding. I think he fully expected to still be invited after this. His wife, whom he started dating when I was 12, feels the same apparently. My whole dad‚Äôs side of the family feels the same way they do, but I‚Äôve already written them off mostly in my mind. My mother is beyond pissed and upset at them. 

I think what upsets me the most is a sense of betrayal. They were my safe spot in the family. I felt like because they‚Äôre close to my age and younger and went to college, they would understand and it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal to them. I almost feel a bit embarrassed because Scott comes from a wonderful Italian Catholic family and they‚Äôve never been anything less than loving and supportive. 

I told them that, on what is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, if they or anyone else is sitting in the audience and in the back of their mind thinking that what we‚Äôre doing is wrong or not right, they should just stay home. I know my brother and family love me, but it feels up to a point, conditional, and limited. I told them that they learned being gay is wrong, they weren‚Äôt born not liking gay people. So they can unlearn it, if they were willing. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to happen.

Edit: okay, legit did not expect this many responses. Been getting some interesting negative feedback. All I will say is that I was genuinely interested in hearing if anyone had an idea somewhere in between ‚Äúyoure the asshole, he‚Äôs family. Invite him‚Äù and ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the asshole, fuck him. Don‚Äôt invite him‚Äù. I‚Äôm a compromising centrist at heart, but wasn‚Äôt sure I could see where that could fit here on my own.

Sarah and Joey are dating and part of a fairly sizeable fetish community locally and they go to a lot of gatherings and are generally fairly openly kinky. Grand, you do you, go nuts.

We moved in together for the upcoming year and all was going pretty well until two days ago when I came home and Michelle immediately pulled me into her room to explain that Sarah and Joey had put up a ton of LGBT and Fetish related flags all over the living room (side note TIL about fetish pride flags, there are a lot of them). They are only those little hand sized flags but they're in a big chain thing across one wall of the living room. 

Then there's some ""art"". It's just close up pictures of genitals that I am 100% certain include the two of them and the other people from their little club.

Then there's a shelf that used to have a couple of tiny cactii on it that now has a leather mask, riding crop, and condom bowl. 

I don't think it's unreasonable to say that we were both obviously beyond uncomfortable with the entire situation. 

We sat Joey and Sarah down and told them we were uncomfortable and it all had to go. They said it was unfair because it was their lifestyle and they wanted people who came over to the flat to know it was ""a kink friendly place to be yourself"" for any guests or additional partners that might come over and that the living room shouldn't be a place of oppression (unless it's consensual).

I said it absolutely fucking wasn't and the only ""kink friendly place to be yourself"" was your private spaces, and that the living room wasn't a place for sex when it's shared. 

They feel like they'd made their lifestyle clear before we moved in and that the living room is shared and therefore they can do what they like in it. 

Michelle and I explained the situation to the housing company we're living in and asked if we could break the lease and move into a two bed together. The manager we spoke to went *nuts* and screamed at Joey and Sarah that he wanted them out and was going to contact his lawyer. I think he's under the impression that they're going to have loads of people over for sex parties all the time and we can only have a limited number of guests. Also that it's disgusting.

9,AITA for refusing to change out of my bikini to save my niece's feelings?,20595,Not the A-hole,1675,ho4td0,1594336406.0,"My husband assures me that i'm not TA, and I agreed at the time but now I feel a bit guilty because I don't want to upset anyone, a child least of all.


Since i've been home more for quarantine I Marie-Kondo'd my closet, which means getting rid of all of my old bathing suits (they all lost elasticity or were worn out) except for one - this is relevant later.


This past weekend we had a small family gathering at our house because its hot and we have a pool (and quarantine limitations had been lifted in our area a while ago so we finally decided to get together for the first time in 3 months). My husbands parents, his brother and wife (SIL), and their 2 kids, niece 9f and nephew 6m came over. 


So we're all in the backyard BBQing and getting ready to swim. I change into my swimwear and come outside and start applying sunscreen. SIL rushes over to me and pulls me aside and asks that I cover up or change into something less revealing like a 1-piece as niece has been sensitive lately and dealing with some body image issues regarding feeling fat (she's not). I tell her that regrettably this is the only swimsuit I have anymore due to cleaning out my closet and I plan on swimming as it was sweltering hot, but after my sunscreen dries i'd be happy to throw something on over my swimsuit until i'm actually in the water. 


She then asked me if I could just go inside then at least until the sunscreen soaks in and come out covered up. I was like uh no? I'm not going to hide in my home for 30+ mins while we have company over that we haven't seen in 3 months. SIL says it will hurt niece to see me in a 2-piece because of my ""unrealistic body image"". I tell her there's nothing unrealistic about me because i'm a real person so I don't even know what that means, and i'm sure niece will be fine for only 30 mins. I also said that while I sympathize with body image issues as i've dealt with them in the past myself, it's probably not helping to just shelter her from seeing people's bodies and maybe work on body positivity instead. She says I don't understand because I don't have kids. So I sit in the shade to apply sunscreen and let it soak in and she takes niece inside for over half an hour before coming back out. 


I don't know if i'm in the wrong here, maybe I could have just gone inside for a while to spare my niece's feelings but at the same time I feel like I shouldn't have to hide my body - and at my own house for that matter. And it was just a 2-piece, it wasn't like really booby or revealing - the top was high-cut kinda like a sports bra and the bottoms were normal bikini cut, they weren't like a thong bottom or anything. I didn't notice that niece was upset but SIL definitely was, maybe niece was just hiding her feelings? I don't want to add to her body image issues and feel kinda bad now reflecting on it in case I made her feel bad. AITA?


Edit: wow I was not expecting this kind of response. Thanks for your judgment everyone, i'm replying where I can. There's a lot of people dragging SIL in the comments, but I will note that she's generally a good person even though she may have come off badly in my post, I personally don't think it's her fault and suspect social media or peer pressure is the cause of niece feeling bad about her body, but that's just my personal speculation.",False,1594319881.0,2020-07-09 16:13:26
10,AITA For not considering my parents adopted children as my siblings and not being willing to take them in if something happens to my parents,20440,Not the A-hole,3004,hon97j,1594409268.0,"I know the title probably makes me sound horrible, but there is a lot more to the story.

So my parents had me very late in their lives after a crapton of tries and being told they could not have kids. Well here I am, but my dad was 51 and my mom 45 when I was born.

Despite their age they were amazing parents, loving, caring, strict but fair and they were in a very good financial position in large part due to their age, so they put me through very good schools and paid my tuition to Uni and so on, in other words I had a great youth and was set up for success.

Well I am 26 now, I am doing well for myself, however the problem started 3 years ago. They missed having me in the house, it felt empty they said so they were considering adoption from another country where laws are more lacking as in our country their age would likely prevent them from even being considered, I told them that this was a horrible idea due to thrir age.

Last year they succeeded in adopting a little girl and her brother aged 3 and 5 and I have only met them a few times so far all times they were extremely shy and frankly, I am not close to them at all as I live halfway across the country so obviously I do not consider them my siblings but more so as my parents kids.

Issue is my dad is now 77 and my mom is 71, they are still very fit for their age and have a live in nanny to help out, but lets be honest, they are in the agegroup where it is likely the end is near.

So I visited them a week ago and asked them what their plans were for the kids if they die before they are adults and they were pretty much lost for words, looked confused and answered ""Obviously you will take them in, you are their brother."" I pretty much had the same rwaction as they had to my question and told them there was no way, I hardly know them, I am not close to them, I do not consider them my siblings and I certainly wont take care of two kids.

Went over about as well as you can expect, loads of yelling and screaming which led to me leaving, I have not spoken to them since apart from my mom sending me messages to reconsider. Obviously I do feel bad though, there is no one else who can take care of them, no other family, no close friends, just me, so they'll end up in the foster system.

My (16F) dad and mom (both 37F&40M) got a divorce two years ago because my father cheated on my mother, her (the mistress) and my dad got married two months after my parents got a divorce.

My parents have joint custody of me and my siblings (17M & 16M (my twin brother), we‚Äôre all close and decided we wanted to visit our father, his wife and her kids (16&15F, the father passed) every two weeks since it was either that or we‚Äôd have to spend our holidays with them (mother‚Äôs orders) which we all didn‚Äôt want.

I don‚Äôt like the two teenage girls and neither do my brothers, they‚Äôve called us the n word multiple times (our dad is Italian while our mom is black, my stepsisters&stepmom are white), usually stay out late, smoke etc.

Story:

We were at my dad‚Äôs house, my brother (twin) and I were playing video games in the living room, my stepsister (16) wanted to watch tv even though she has a tv in her room, we told her to give us half an hour since we hadn‚Äôt been playing for long, my stepsister called us both ‚Äòghetto n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äò out of nowhere and my stepmother came downstairs to ask what happened.

I explained to her what happened and she told me ‚ÄúAnna (random name), I‚Äôve talked to you about this, stop being weak.‚Äù

I asked her if my stepsister would be getting a consequence and she told me no because I was being weak, then added ‚Äúfor a black girl‚Äù.

I responded by saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm weak yet you don‚Äôt have enough respect for yourself to leave a man who forgot to tell you he had a wife and kids.‚Äù since she wasn‚Äôt aware my father had a family while he was cheating with her.

They are good kids and I love them to death but they have both adopted very specific diets. It started with Mark getting into weight lifting/body building last year.

He is on a ‚Äúcut‚Äù right now and is dieting like crazy. He gave me a list of approved foods for his diet and its basically just chicken, broccoli, brown rice, tuna, lentils, potatoes. There a couple more veggies that I‚Äôm ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to cook with but that‚Äôs basically it.

Mark was a really chubby kid and I know the body building was a huge turning point for him so I want to support him. I was cooking two meals for the family every night, one for him and one for Jenny and I. It was a bit stressful but I was managing.

About a month ago Jenny told me she was going vegan. This is something she wants to do for ethical and environmental reasons and I support her. She gave me a book of vegan recipes to use.

Making a full vegan meal for one kid and a ‚Äúbody building‚Äù meal for the other takes 2 hours minimum if you include planning, prep, cooking and cleaning. The ingredients for these diets are pricey so our grocery bills have skyrocketed. Marks hates spice, Jenny loves spice. Jenny hates lentils and broccoli so I can‚Äôt even try to combines some of their meals

Both kids hate cooking and refuse to help. They make their own breakfast but not lunch so I have to portion their dinners so they can bring leftovers.

Yesterday I was just exhausted and just didn‚Äôt want to cook. I told the kids to order takeout when I went to take a nap. Well I woke up from my nap to two pissed off kids.

Both of them were giving me shit for not cooking; Mark bitching takeout food is too greasy, Jenny bitching there weren‚Äôt any vegan restaurants in our area.

Something inside me broke. I just started crying and told them both they were on their own from now on. I would buy the groceries but I wasn‚Äôt cooking another damn meal.

Jenny called me a shit mom and ran off to her room and Mark just rolled his eyes at me.

Neither kid is talking to me right now and I just feel like shit. I wanna support my kids in whatever they do. At the same time, I just can‚Äôt cook anymore. My whole life is just work, cook, sleep.

Am I an asshole? Are my kids right, am I a shit mom?

tldr: Both my kids have specific diets and want me to cook for them. I am tired of it and am going on a cooking strike.

EDIT: I honestly cant believe the amount of comments I am getting. I just logged in after making the post this morning and I am just overwhelmed.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the support. I am sobbing right now.

With regards to my kids. Please know that they are really wonderful kids that are going though a rough time and not dealing with it the right way.  Their father hurt them, and is still hurting them, deeply. I am saving up to afford therapy for them. Hopefully in a couple months I can get them into a session.

I grew up in a household where my mom was superwoman... just did it all with a smile. I wanted to be that for my kids. After my ex husband left us, I tried to hold onto it.

I see now that I just did them a huge disservice. I will be strong in this and they will learn to fend for themselves, one way or another. I am receiving a lot of great advice and I take it to heart.",False,1594358405.0,2020-07-09 21:09:13
13,AITA for not letting bf correct a Chinese woman?,17464,Not the A-hole,2305,hr9wde,1594789248.0,"We live in a shared house with a bunch of random Craigslist roommates. One of them is Chinese, and was sitting at the kitchen table during lunch time slurping her noodles and minding her own business. 

My boyfriend had just come into the kitchen to eat his own lunch, and rather than ask her how her weekend was or anything other polite conversation he instead asks her, ‚ÄúCan I teach you something about culture?‚Äù 

I *knew* he was going to tell her that Americans consider it rude to slurp food. But this woman wasn‚Äôt at a business event; she was in her own house and (in my opinion) can eat her own culture‚Äôs food however she damn well pleases, especially since she was sitting alone by herself first and we just happened to enter the same room after.

So I cut my boyfriend off and said, ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù He kept trying to talk to her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say anything!‚Äù I said again. He kept wanting to press the issue.

Ignoring me, he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, but Americans think it‚Äôs rude to slurp your food.‚Äù

‚ÄúJeff - stop it! Drop it!‚Äù I said, as she looked highly embarrassed and quietly continued eating her meal.

I apologized to her and said, ‚ÄúI apologize for Jeff‚Äòs comment.‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúAnd I apologize for my girlfriend not letting me talk to you.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Jeff‚Äôs place to ‚Äúeducate‚Äú people who ***didn‚Äôt ask for feedback and were just trying to be comfortable in their own home.*** 

He thinks I‚Äôm being a ‚Äúculturally insensitive, racist liberal‚Äù for not letting him ‚Äúhelp‚Äù teach her American customs.

Who‚Äôs being the asshole here?

Edit: By ‚Äúhelp‚Äù teach her American etiquette, he meant that he wanted to tell her that Americans would find it rude if she slurped her food at a business lunch or such occasion, not that she had to stop doing it at home. 

He worked as a ‚Äúcultural consultant‚Äù abroad, helping foreign business people secure deals with Americans by teaching them about customs and mannerisms and whatnot. So I genuinely believe that Jeff thought he was doing her a favor by letting her know that others might be turned off by slurping. But I still think that 
1) it‚Äôs not his place to give such information unsolicited, and
2) the minute you point out that ‚ÄúAmericans‚Äù find slurping rude, she‚Äôs going to feel self-conscious and judged about doing it at home, even if Jeff says it doesn‚Äôt bother him.",False,1594764440.0,2020-07-14 22:00:48

My fiance has been very open about this loss and how it has affected him throughout our relationship. I know he misses her and the memories he has with her and important and special. I don't want to take away anything or demean the relationship, and I've always been there for him on hard days and supported him when he needed it. We got engaged last year, the date is TBD still for obvious reasons. It was very emotional for both of us, and we've been really happy. But since planning the wedding, I've been feeling like I'm not only planning it for myself, but for Mandy as well. 

It started as comments from his family. A lot of ""Oh Mandy would have loved this"" type things. I brushed it off at first and just thought it was a way of them processing grief. I have a great relationship with his family, but I know they loved Mandy too. When I went dress shopping, his mom and sister came. They kept talking about what dress Mandy would have worn, what they could see her in, etc. It might seem like nothing, but it really overtook the conversation, so much so that another bridesmaid told me later that she felt uncomfortable for me too. It turned from harmless comments into focusing what should be a special event for me into reminiscing over Mandy.

My latest project has been compiling old photos of me and my fiance for a slideshow at the reception (or rehearsal dinner we haven't decided). He told me theres something he's been wanting to ask me: he really wants to include some kind of ""in memory of Mandy"" into our wedding, and thinks the slideshow would be a perfect place. At this point, I was (and still kinda am) fed up with the Mandy comments taking over our wedding. I sternly told him that no I don't think that would be appropriate, as this is our wedding and should focus on us. We are having a table with pictures of loved ones who passed, and she will be featured there. He told me that he doesn't think that's enough to honor her memory. He wants to incorporate her in a bigger way, as she never got her dream wedding. He also thinks it would be a sweet surprise for Mandy's parents (who are invited since he is still really close to them). 

I did lose my cool, I will admit. I told him honestly how I felt about the Mandy situation taking over our wedding, and how I'm uncomfortable with it. I also asked him if he could ask his family to limit the Mandy comments at our wedding, since now I'm afraid the whole wedding will be focused on her. I told him that I need time away to think and have been staying at my parent's house, but we've still been talking.

16,WIBTA if I refused to be part of the my inlaws family tradition?,15935,Not the A-hole,540,hr489y,1594771468.0,"My husband and i have been together for almost 6 years. Married for 3. We have a 1 year old. I love his family but I struggle with the differences in how they treat their son (my SO) vs their daughter (SIL). Anything she wants she gets. I don't start drama however I will stand up for what I think is right and it occasionally causes tension.

They have a wonderful tradition where they create a picture calendar for their grandma for Christmas. Every month highlights the people whose anniversaries or birthdays it is. The rest filled in with loving memories. Since we got married I am now in a couple of the photos. I felt loved to have been included in such a tradition but last year caused issues. Our sons birthday and our anniversary fall on the same month (no else shares anything special with this month). His parents told us we could design that page with the 3 of us however we like. I choose 4 photos. One of our son just born, one of us as a family, one of him with his (great) grandma, and one of just my husband and I. We create the page and send it. We stop by one night to continue helping them (my husband is better at doing it online than them) when I realize my SIL has swapped out one of my photos for a picture of her with my son. I made a comment about how that is not what we designed and she tells me she likes it that way and wants to use that photo.

At this point in time she is in roughly 75%of the photos/book. 
12 months each with 4 pictures per page = 48 photos. 
She is in almost 36 photos out of 48. Has a whole page dedicated to just her. And a good portion of her photos are of just her. I suggest she take out of her photos from a previous month and use that one instead. I then changed it back to the photo I wanted.

She ushers us out for the house. Christmas comes around and the calendar is brought out. She had changed it back to the photo she wanted. I was furious but let it go because 
1) It was for grandma who I adore 
2) We didn't pay for it, his parents did and SIL chipped in a little bit (we offered)

This year I offer to help with the calendar again and get told she has a special idea for this year. She wants to do recreation photos (take an older photo and using the same people take the photo again) I think its a great idea and understand that it means my son and I won't be in it. I'm sad but still offer to help. She declines.

Then I find out she wants to do half the book with special recreation. She wants to take some of grandmas old photos and use the new gen to recreate them. I think this is great and now my son and i can at least be in one photo.

Nope.
She wants to be her grandma in every shot. Wants to use my SO as grandmas husband and my son as my FIL as a baby. 
They have no use for me. I mention this makes me upset and I want to be part of this tradition and upon her parents pushing she tells me I can take the group family photos.

WIBTA If I tell them no? That if I cant be in it I don't want anything to do with it?

UPDATE:
Wow this has taken off! Thanks for all the loveüíô So a few hours after I posted my SO came home for lunch and inquired as to why my phone was blowing up. I told him. He was pissed. Turns out SIL told him a little about the ideas and that the whole family was involved. He assumed that meant me. He is now refusing to do anything unless I'm part of it and that our son will not be in anything unless we are a part of it (unless it's a gen pic-ie Grandpa with grandson). Said i am his most important family ü•∞. Now he wants nothing to do with the calendar. I am trying to talk him into talking to his parents first as this is a lovely tradition.

17,WIBTA for having my cousin arrested?,15321,Not the A-hole,2057,hqtm4s,1594724408.0,"Backstory:
A few months ago (pre-COVID) my cousin, who I am close to, had a big co-ed baby shower thrown for her. I was in attendance, along with my husband. Another cousin was visiting her parents, my aunt and uncle, and decided to attend the baby shower as well. I‚Äôm not close to this cousin at all. We didn‚Äôt grow up together and are 10 years apart in age. 
We are obligatory Facebook friends though, mostly due to my aunt and mother asking us both to add each other.


Skip ahead to present day:
A few days ago I got a call from a bank I have a credit card through, inquiring about my balance not being paid, as I have always paid my outstanding bills on time. I told the bank employee I had not used my card, so that charge was fraud. The card account was immediately closed, and they began the process of looking further into it. Today they called me back with an update. The charge was for a donation to a charity that I knew of but have never contributed to myself. Still confused about why my card was used, I posted a short rant on FB. I got a few replies telling me this had never happened to them, and hoping I got it all resolved soon. Then my younger non-pregnant cousin commented something to the effect of  ‚ÄúWell, maybe someone had a good reason for making the donation in your name. Maybe someone wanted to teach you a lesson.‚Äù The comment was weird, so I PM‚Äôed her to ask what she meant. At first she wouldn‚Äôt tell me what she meant, but eventually I got her to tell me everything. 

She used my CC to make a donation. 

Her reason? Because about a year ago I began going to church. I didn‚Äôt grow up in a religious family. I‚Äôm not vocal about my newfound beliefs. I don‚Äôt throw it in people‚Äôs faces or demand they believe the same. It‚Äôs just something that I like for my own life. It makes me feel better and more relaxed. Apparently my cousin has a problem with me deciding to attend and join a church of any kind. And because of that she decided it was a good idea to sneak around and take photos of my credit card. And then use the info to make a $1000 donation to a local organization she knew I would never donate to because they‚Äôre very outspoken about opposing what I believe morally. My husband says I should press charges and have her arrested. My mom says that‚Äôs going too far, even though my cousin was in the wrong, because she‚Äôs only 19. 

So WIBTA for pressing charges on my cousin and possibly ruining her life?

Edit: the organization is not anti-gay or anything like that. It‚Äôs not PP either. FYI, I‚Äôm a gay male who is pro-choice so stop assuming I‚Äôm some kind of intolerant lunatic. 

Edit 2: It seems I‚Äôm not allowed to post an update separately. The bank is proceeding with legal action. She‚Äôs being held accountable by them. I‚Äôm still undecided, as it‚Äôs mostly out of my hands now.",False,1594819317.0,2020-07-14 04:00:08
18,AITA for telling a woman that her husband is probably a porn addict after she told me to move because I was ‚Äúdistracting‚Äù him?,15025,Not the A-hole,1514,hp2jq8,1594464409.0,"I often go the local park to study/read a book etc. There‚Äôs this apartment complex near the park and people living there have a direct view of the park.  

Yesterday I was chillin when this woman who lives in the apartment came up to me. She asked me if I could move to another spot. I asked her why and she said that I was ‚Äúdistracting‚Äù her husband. I was confused and at first didn‚Äôt even understand what she meant by that. She was SUPER vague but clarified that her husband does ‚Äú*what men do*‚Äù and that I should go somewhere else. 

So at this point I was pretty disgusted. I replied that I wouldn‚Äôt move and put my headphones on again. She got very irritated and said that I should respect other people‚Äôs wishes and ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù. Then she said that I come to the park too often and that I should consider other people‚Äôs marriage. Apparently she discussed this with other women in the apartment and they agree with her. 

I told her that I don‚Äôt care about anybody‚Äôs marriage and that her husband is probably a porn addict if he can‚Äôt handle the sight of a female stranger in public. 

Well that clearly pissed her off because she was seething with anger. She said that her husband doesn‚Äôt watch porn and called me a ‚Äúsick, twisted little girl‚Äù for even suggesting that. I told her that she was making me really uncomfortable but she was STILL attacking me over the porn addict comment. She kept repeating that he doesn‚Äôt watch porn & that he‚Äôs not interested in me and not to flatter myself. 

Afterwards she left but not before telling me that I will ‚Äúface consequences‚Äù sooner or later. 

I told my friend about it and she thinks I‚Äôm an AH for accusing the woman‚Äôs husband of being a porn addict. She said that it was very disrespectful and that she understands why the woman got so upset. And she added that I shouldn‚Äôt upset a crazy person since I can‚Äôt predict what she might do.

Am I the AH here?

Having grown up with dogs all her life, she insisted we get a puppy once we were married. We both work from home so there is always someone in the house with her. I'd never have a dog before, but could see this was important to her so said yes and got us a pup.

My wife never really bonded with the dog as I did, and I'm the dogs favourite. I do the majority of walks, training, and playing with the dog. I think she expected a puppy to act like a full grown dog and not need direction and training. We live near my in laws, and they have asked to have the dog stay over quite often as theirs recently died and they were missing having a pet around. The dog gets on well with them so I allowed it. There didn't seem to be any issues with this.

We now have a 2 year old child, and my wife is pregnant with another baby. She has recently said she feels like she would be overwhelmed being on maternity (for 15 months) with a toddler, baby, and dog to look after and wants her parents to take the dog permanently. They have joked about doing so ever since we got the dog, and I've always been clear they could only take if I died.

I do occasionally travel for work, maybe I'm away five days a month, so could see how it may be difficult on those days I'm not around. But otherwise I feel like it was her decision to get a dog, and it's not a decision you can lightly go back on, even if it would be staying in the wider family. I would miss having the dog around, but my wife thinks I'm being unfair to her, and to the children and dog. she feels she wouldn't be able to give any of them the attention they deserve if she had to manage them all, when the in laws are ready and willing to take the dog. Ultimately I think she regrets getting the dog and doesn't want to have to put up with the additional cleaning and responsibility that comes with one, particularly when she has what she sees as a win win in terms of still seeing the dog several times a week through the in laws but having no other responsibilities.

AITA for wanting to keep the dog?

I only get around 3-4 hours of sleep a night. I think it's because of stress from work, Corona, and a ton of other stuff going on right now. My wife on the other hand is sleeping 10 hours a day.

Because of this I'm up when she's sleeping and she is constantly telling me I'm making noise when I'm not. At first she was texting me saying needed to turn the volume down on the TV or my phone and I would. Soon I figured that I shouldn't use electronics while she's sleeping and stopped, but she still kept texting me. I told her I had turned electronics off and she said I was lying. 

A few days ago she came into the living room yelling that I wasn't responding to her texts and that I needed to turn the volume on my phone down. I informed her that my phone had died and was currently charging. She accused me of gas lighting her even after I showed her the phone off and charging at less than 5% battery life. 

Tonight I started getting texts again saying I was listening to music on my phone too loud. I told her she was lying and that she couldn't hear anything. She started saying that I was an asshole and I was has lighting her and that she knew I was listening to music on my phone. I told her that I was indeed listening to music on my phone, and I had it at full volume. I'm only saying that she couldn't hear it. 

She went on for probably 4 or 5 more texts before I sent her a pin of my location 4 miles away and said, ""I'm on a late night run through the park. You cannot hear my music.""

She says I'm the AH for letting her go on for so long without telling her how I knew she couldn't hear it and that I was only trying to embarrass her. I say that it was necessary for her to finally see the problem and stop.

2) At first I was very sympathetic and would always come in to see if there was any noise. I gave up on doing that after the first week. It's been 2
3) She has been seeing a therapist for over a year now. It's harder to get in contact because of Covid, but yes she's still in therapy. (They use some Skype like app that's been approved for therapy sessions that they can never get to work properly)
4) She has been diagnosed with PTSD and depression from an abusive relationship with her parents. She has been doing amazingly over the past year and this behavior is far from normal for her. I think what's happening now has to do with stress from what's going on in the world right now and the fact that she has been gas light before.

He was fine with it, and I made it pretty clear that I'd be acting like a blacked out drunk person, so he'd have to be responsible for me.

Joe took me to the surgery, but when I got out, he was gone. The doctor's office called him, but he didn't pick up. I was very out of it at the time, so I stayed longer to rest, and was eventually able to call a friend to pick me up.

My son has been bullying his sister lately. Apparently he overheard her talking about getting a boob job. She says she was not even serious about getting her boobs done not that it matters.

Since then my son keeps teasing her about it. He calls her nicknames like flat, lil tits, and pancake chest. He sent her a picture of an A cup bra. She wears C cup bras.


I told him and had talks with him multiple times about how he needs to stop making fun of her boobs. It embarrasses his sister, she always gets upset, and I can tell it makes her feel insecure about them. She used to sometimes wear sports bras and tank tops around the house but stopped for a while. My son stopped for a couple of weeks and she started dressing more usual for her at home. My son made fun of her when she had a shirt on or tank top/sports bra it didn't really change his behavior either way.

Me and my daughter were standing at the door when my son had arrived. My daughter was wearing a sports bra and no shirt over it. While he was walking through the porch he said to his sister that she would have to wear nothing but two post it notes on her chest to show even a little bit of cleavage.

When he said that I slammed the door and locked it. I said he  was not welcome in here. I wanted to make sure my daughter was ok, and protect her from his comments for a few hours before letting him in. He sat in his car.

When my wife got home we let him in. My wife was very angry at me for locking my son out even after explaining what happened. My wife said I am overreacting to ""sibling teasing"". I thought my wife would be on my side since not only does she obviously have tits too, but she used to struggle with her body image. My daughter just called me a good dad. I have been calling her beautiful sometimes too to try to help (non physical compliments too of course!).

Edit: 
Me and my wife agreed to take our son's car keys and phone away until he apologizes to his sister, drops the demeaning comments, and treats his sister (and everyone) with respect for a month. After the month, if he disrespects her again we will reinstate the punishment and consider kicking him out. We asked him why he thinks its ok to talk about his sister's boobs and he didn't have an answer. I asked him why he is so interested in his sister's tits and he got embarrassed.

Me and my wife had a talk with our daughter about how she is perfect and beautiful the way she is. I told her men love C cups and are not picky with boobs, C Cup is not small, most women seem to wish they were C Cup, if she had bigger boobs it could cause problems like giving her back pain, future partners that really care for her will think her body is perfect and will like her boobs, and its not ok for men to treat women disrespectfully like that.

We are getting therapy for both of them too.

26,AITA for telling my wife (39) she can't retire at 40?,11422,Not the A-hole,1753,hp85ph,1594493966.0,"To be clear I don't think I'm the asshole but I'd like some outside perspective.

VERY condensed version:

I (m/44) have been married to my wife for 20 years. We married young and had kids young (19f, 15m, 15m).

My wife and I have built a beautiful life together and both have very well-paying jobs. At this point I'm as high in my company as I will ever get and my wife has worked a high management position in a known multinational. I earn more than her but by very little. We live the typical suburban cookie-cutter family life, we are paying for our children's private education, our cars, our big home and additional vacation home.

Yesterday we were having dinner and joking about vacationspots when she said she'll get enough of that next year when she retires.

At first I thought she was joking  and said ""oh sure, then I'll retire as well and we'll live on a houseboat like I've always wanted"". She got annoyed and said ""well one of us will have to keep working"". Clearly, she was serious.

She told me in no uncertain terms that she felt she had contributed enough (I don't know what she meant) and that she needed time off.

I said that if she was burned out I would do anything to help and that she could take a sebatical or reduce her hours. At first she seemed okay with that idea and I was sort of relieved that we had come to a compromise. Then she suddenly said that, really, the decision wasn't up to me.

I told her that as her husband and given that we have a shared life, it is up to me as well as her since it impacts me directly. I asked her how she expected us to pay the morgage with just my salary. She got angry when I did some math in my head just to show her the overall absurditiy.

Then she accused me of not supporting her. I just asked her to explain where this was coming from since she's always wanted to work.

She said she just wanted to experience life more, that she felt trapped at her job and that there were ways to make it happen, like taking out loans for our kid's colleges. I have to admit that I was losing it a little at this point.

Me: ""I don't know where this is coming from but we can't afford for you not to work. There are no more promotions for me to be had"". She answered along the lines of ""you could just get a different job.""  My wife knows how much I love my job. I've worked at this company for 17 years - I love my partners and my co-workers and I work with my BIL (her brother) who is my best friend.

I told her ""so you want me to be miserable at a new job for the rest of my life just so you don't have to lift a finger anymore"". She just answered ""I'm going to resent you if you make me work after a time where I want to retire"". I mean - cool, so she thinks I'm not going to resent her?

I was exasperated and suggested we just sell everything then, if retiring is something she really wants. She just went to bed and we haven't really talked since.

I feel like I'm missing something here.

AITA?

1. My wife was never a SAHM. She's always been a career woman and I knew that when we got married and fully supported her from the beginning. We've had nannies and support from our families since we had our children.
2. We split household chores evenly and always have.
3. I work between 60 to 70 hours, she a little less than that but with broader timeframes (because of timezones)
4. I'm not divorcing my wife. Stop suggesting that.

\[UPDATE\]

I thought I'd update now, since the situation has been dealt with.

First off I want to say thank you to everyone who left kind comments and tried to genuinely help. Secondly I'd like to say a very big FRICK YOU to the 100 or so people  who suggested divorcing my wife immediately, who predicted she was going to divorce me or who send me incredibly nasty messages telling me my wife was probably exhausted from birthing me children and didn't care for me clarifying that my wife was never a SAHM. I have no idea what sort of lives you lead but suggesting divorce at the drop of a hat is pathetic and makes me wonder what sort of commited relationships you all are having. If you all can drop someone you love and have commited to over every single silly little dispute, it's not wonder you are all miserable, lonely pricks who who have nothing better to do than to insult other people on reddit.

Now on to the update++

My wife went to visit her mother today and while she was driving back my MIL called me to say that there was something my wife needed to talk to me about and to maybe also get our children involved. MIL sounded heartbroken on the phone and was crying, so obviously, I got really really worried, got my children to come home (the boys, daughter later joined via facetime). My wife got home and she looked so awful, like she cried all day and she let me hug her, so I saw that as a good sign.

We all sat down and here's basically what is going on: my SIL, my wife's twin sister, who lives in another country, has breast cancer. She found out last week, only told my wife, swore her to secrecy so SIL could tell their mother in peace and pretty much left my wife stew in her misery over it. My wife is heartbroken, apparently the diagnose is not good. She was the only one who knew and didn't want to break her promise so she didn't tell anyone. We are all very shocked and still processing. MIL also only found out yesterday so really, nobody is handling the news too well right now.

My wife says she realized in the past week that she can't continue her life like this, that she felt so guilty after her sister told her because they never see each other and she feels like all she's done her whole life is just make money and put off her life for later and that she got so scared about being stuck doing the same thing for the next twenty years. She said she didn't want it to come off the way it did when she told me but that she wasn't in her right mind. But she also said that she really can't continue like this. She feels like she's too apart from her family, too stuck in her own little work-related world and that all she does is contribute money and is too detached emotionally. I told her I don't feel like that is true at all and my children agreed, but obviously if she feels that way than it's a concern.

I'm honestly not sure what we're going to do yet but my wife is just so distraught about the whole thing, she kept crying. Our children being part of the conversation helped her, I think because she saw that we are all here to support and help her.

There are still many more conversations to be had, obviously. She's going to need help, that much is clear and we are planning on driving to see SIL as soon as humanly possible. My daughter wants to come to, I think seeing her mother the way she was today shook us all a lot.

My BIL is coming over in an hour to talk so hopefully we can come up with some sort of gameplan then.

Last Update:

I've been made aware that this post was put on youtube without my permission which I'm absolutely not okay with. Please delete.

We are with SIL now and unfortunately it is not looking good. My wife is beside herself and we've agreed on therapy for now but as we are out of town it'll have to wait. For now she has talked to her direct superior and is off of work for a few weeks. We've talked with our children again and while we are all on the same page regarding SIL, the kids are understandably very worried about not being able to finish their education at their respective schools. Wife has indicated she's fine with talking about the work thing again soon but right now SIL is a priority. BIL is in in the know about this issue as well and has vowed to help however he can.",False,1594886816.0,2020-07-11 11:59:26
27,AITA for not telling my wife that our daughter snuck out to a party late at night?,11224,Not the A-hole,1119,hr2awo,1594764976.0,"On Sunday at around 3 a.m, I received a call from my 16 year old daughter Brittany saying that she snuck out of the house and needed me to pick her up.  She told me that she was a little drunk and that the friend who drove her left her behind and that more people were showing up at the party and she was uncomfortable. I begrudgingly told her sure and to wait for me somewhere safe.

I picked her up and got fast food with her so we could have time to talk without waking up the house. I told her how disappointed I was and that what she did wasn't fair to me since I have to work. She profusely apologized and told me that she wouldn't sneak out of the house again. However, she begged me not tell her Mom because she is ridiculously strict with types of thingsand I do sympathize with her as she is a teen so these types of things will happen no matter . I also was afraid that if I told her Mom that she would never trust me again and feel like that could be dangerous in case she ever needed help (like now).

So things were fine until Monday night when my wife saw a picture of the party on Instagram and Brittany was in it.......
My wife lost her mind and started to interrogate Brittany about what she was doing , who was there, etc . She got really mad at her and made Brittany cry and go to her room. The problem though was that my wife asked how Brittany got there and back and she told the truth.... Now my wife is infuriated with me for not telling her. She got even more mad when I told her why I didn't. I said that I knew how she would react, that I didn't want to break Brittany's trust, and how protecting her safety (I want her to call me when she's in those situations) was more important than us telling each other everything. She stormed off too and we haven't really spoken much since then. AITA?

Also to note, we're in a country where social gatherings are still allowed so she wasn't mad about the covid aspect.",False,False,2020-07-14 15:16:16
28,AITA for not wanting a female therapist?,11074,Not the A-hole,1529,hoqd4x,1594421780.0,"I (21M) have made the decision to go to therapy. I have many issues I need to sort out. This pleased my sister (24F) cos she's been to therapy and talked about so many benefits to it. 

So I have many issues I want to sort out. But I want two distinct factors in my therapist:

1) I want a male therapist 

2) I want an older male, someone over 50

This is because one of my issues I want to sort is my own issues with my masculinity - what it means to be a man in today's world. I also have ""daddy issues"" that I need to sort and would feel more comfortable with an older male, rather than someone my own age. 

Anyway when I said this my sister said I was an AH and sexist. However she specifically sought out a female therapist so idk why she is having these double standards. AITA?",False,False,2020-07-10 15:56:20
29,AITA for drinking in the morning and telling my girlfriend to leave me alone about it?,12118,Not the A-hole,1329,hrosbh,1594852887.0,"Classic ""I know this sounds bad, but..."" and throwaway because she knows my main.

I (29m) have been dating my girlfriend (27f) for a year and a few months.  She moved in with me just about three weeks ago.  Honestly, since she's moved in I've been feeling a bit smothered. She's currently unemployed due to Covid and doesn't seem to be very aggressively looking for work and I feel like she sort of expects my attention all the time, and I feel like she's been scrutinizing me too much.

I'm an essential worker and recently was moved to overnights. Yesterday morning when I got home from work at a little after 7am she wasn't awake yet. I was a little too wound up from work to go straight to bed so I decided to pour myself a bourbon and sat down to find something mindless to watch on YouTube.  

My girlfriend got up maybe 15 or 20 minutes later and came into the living room where I was sitting. As I greeted her I saw her eyes narrow as she looked at the glass in front of me. ""Wait a minute,"" she said. ""You're actually *drinking*?""

""Yeah, so?"" I answered.

""It's morning. Who drinks first thing in the morning?"" 

I tried to explain to her that it wasn't ""first thing in the morning"" to me, that this was my evening time, and that just because I worked overnights didn't mean that I shouldn't be able to unwind after work with a drink like anyone else. But she just couldn't seem to get past that it was ""morning.""

Finally I'd had enough and told her that she needs to stop smothering me, that I'm a grown man and unless I'm doing something egregious that I shouldn't have to justify myself to her and that I don't need to her permission to have a drink. I told her that I was trying to relax and that if she was just going to give me a hard time to please just leave me alone.

She's been pretty quiet with me since. I know I hurt her feelings which I feel bad about, but I also think she was being unreasonable and somewhat controlling and that I wasn't wrong to tell her to knock it off. AITA?

Edit: Wow, this blew up. Thanks everyone. I have to say; I went all the way to the bottom just out of curiosity over the unpopular opinions and a couple in particular didn't deserve the downvotes. One especially suggested that this may have been mere ""growing pains"" for a couple newly learning to live together. Although I absolutely still think my gf was being way too close-minded and somewhat controlling I think that poster may have a point. My profession is a currently unpopular one and has a pretty abysmal divorce rate and while my girlfriend was being unfair I realize I also took my night out on her to an extent and probably should have been more patient. Hopefully she can see my side, too.

To my ""aggressively seeking employment"" comment most of of my state has reopened and while it's still a really tough job-market it's not abysmal by any extent.

30,AITA for telling my kids the real reason their mother has been crying lately?,10878,Asshole,1370,hpwhom,1594597682.0,"I have a 23 year old son who is married and currently staying with us due to financial issues, and a 19 year old daughter who is home from college. My wife has been having bouts of crying recently. She just began menopause so I'm sure that has something to do with it, but I do think there are underlying issues that the hormones brought out. She has told me that she feels like she wasted her life, because she was a stay at home mom and she is not happy with how the children turned out. 

We are both Palestinian. She was born in Israel and I was born in the US, but neither of us wanted our children to be too westernized. She feels like she failed to keep the balance and that our children have no respect for their culture. Our son married a white woman (we don't care about that), left Christianity and his wife is a very vocal atheist. My wife can't stand having her in the house. Our daughter considers herself a political activist and has turned her back on everything her mother has taught her. 

My wife got into a little fight with our DIL last night over mascara (I wish I was kidding) and stormed off in tears. Our daughter made a comment about how high maintenance her mom is and I told them both to leave her alone, she is going through a lot. My son wanted to know, so I was honest that she feels like they've turned their backs on our culture and that she is disappointed.

31,"AITA for telling my boyfriend that if he doesn't want to go vegan, he has to learn to cook for himself?",10796,Not the A-hole,1557,hqldjb,1594695445.0,"I (21f) just moved in with my boyfriend (22m). It's his first time ever living away from home, whereas I spent 3 years living in uni accomodation. We've been together for 4 years. I've been vegan since I was about 15, he eats meat, and it's never been an issue between us at all. I have never cooked him meat or dairy products, because he is capable of putting things in the oven or microwave, and I wouldn't feel comfortable cooking it anyway (or safe, I'd be worried about cooking it wrong even if I was ok with it). I know how to cook to an ok level, I'm not brilliant but I can do about 10 staple dishes from scratch and I like trying new things. He does know I'm not ok with preparing meat or dairy and he's always been fine with that. 

Since we moved out, I've been doing most of the cooking. He makes his own lunches (which mostly consists of him going to McDonalds or getting a meal deal), but he's decided he wants to be more healthy, and he wants me to start bulk cooking so he can take lunch to work. I agreed, and asked him to give me some ideas of what he'd like me to prepare. Long story short, he asked me to cook him some sort of chicken pasta. I told him I'd be fine with cooking the pasta (the pasta and sauce is vegan) but not the chicken, which he could buy precooked from the shop or he could cook himself. He had a little sulk because he 'doesn't know how to cook chicken' and was 'worried he'd get salmonella'. I told him that this is the perfect chance to learn how to cook for himself, to which he responded that, as the one out of the two of us in a full time job, I should learn how to cook for him. I told him that, firstly, I go to uni every day and I also have a part time job that I've been doing a lot more shifts at lately, so we both work most days. Secondly, I'm not comfortable with it, and he knows that. 

He says I'm forcing him to be vegan, but I really disagree considering I've told him I'll make him the base for the meal, he just has to sort the meat. I'm really confused because he's never had this attitude before, am I being an asshole? His parents are saying I am.",False,False,2020-07-13 19:57:25
32,AITA for insulting my SIL for wanting me to make her beadwork for her wedding?,10571,Not the A-hole,791,hq4uq2,1594626920.0,"Throwaway, my bro knows my account. 

I (19F, Native american (Oglala Lakota)) do beadwork as a hobby/side hustle, and have since I was 14. I'm not the greatest ever üòÇ but my stuff is decent enough that I make a pretty good amount of extra money from it. 

My older brother's (26M) fiance (35F) is a NIGHTMARE. My whole family does their best to be respectful of her and of their relationship, but she treated us like a unique oddity because of our culture and when that fascination wore off, she began to treat us like we were uncivilized and dumb. 

I argue with her a lot and I was certain she hated my guts. Until a few days ago when she came to me with a gift card that had $150 in it. She was being pure sweet to me and said she was sorry for ""getting off on the wrong foot"". I said it was okay, I understood but wished she'd be more respectful of us.

Then she started talking about her plans for a ""Native American wedding"" with my brother. I was annoyed and knew it was going to be disrespectful asf but I didn't say anything, I'd just talk to my bro later. Then she asked how much I charge for the earrings I make. I told her $35. She tried to barter with me and when I told her I was firm on my price, she got mad but was quiet. 

After a bit she said ""Okay, could you make a pair for me and my bridesmaids and maids of honor? 12 pairs by November? I could do $400 for them."" 

I never take orders bc I hate being rushed so I told her I'd have to think about it. She left all angry. Abt an hr later my bro came into my room and was getting mad at me, he said his fiance ""Already paid for the earrings"" and ""why couldn't I just give them a family discount in exchange for being in their wedding"". I told him no, she didn't pay, she gave me a gift. He asked for it back and I told him no. She didn't say it was for the earrings. 

An argument ensued between my bro, his girl, and I that ended with her telling me I wasn't allowed to come to their wedding and wouldn't be allowed to see my nephew/niece if they had kids. I said cool aight, I don't like you anyway and never wanted to be in your wedding and that they weren't getting the money back. 

THEN she had the audacity to go into my room and start looking around for the money. I told her to get out and she started insulting me and my beadwork. I asked her where that hatred for my work was when she was trying to buy from me. She said it was to be nice because I ""don't get sales"".

I informed her that I did in fact get plenty of sales and didn't have to rely on trashy, tacky Karens to buy from me. She called me racist and cried hard and played victim. She called me a fat bitch, so I said that as fat as I am, I'm glad I'm not built like a barrel on sticks with the big ass head and hog body she has. 

My brother is now threatening to disown me if I don't apologize and make the earrings. I know I was argumentative, but I felt so disrespected. AITA?

EDIT: I followed the advice of some of you and decided to take the higher path here. I apologized to my FSIL and my brother and gave the money back, and I explained to my FSIL that beadwork means a lot to me and I have a very hard time taking orders, but that I would love to make her a pair for her wedding for free but I just couldn't do 11 other pairs. 

She was extremely quiet and sat with a grimace on her face the whole time we all spoke and I could tell it wasn't good enough for her, but she never said anything. My brother and I cried it out afterwards when we spoke alone and he said he didn't want to choose between her or his family because he cares about her. I told him I understood and wouldn't make him make that choice and would try harder to get along with her. I asked him why he's been distancing himself from his culture and from speaking our language together and he said it was because it makes her feel uncomfortable. 

I told him that I know our culture means a lot to him and he shouldn't have to put that aside for her and that he shouldn't allow her to get away with disrespecting his family and culture just because he loves her. He got quiet and I could tell that I made him think about things.

Well, as I suspected it wasn't enough for my FSIL Karen. She and my brother argued all night last night because she was trying to convince him to take my beading supplies to make me do the pairs for their wedding. She started insulting my family and me and threw a big fit when he stood up to her. 
 
Currently where we stand is that she was bawling her eyes out on our porch and my brother doesn't know how the wedding is going to go or if it's happening at all. I'll update if anything else happens. 

Also thank you for everyone interested in my beadwork, it means a lot to me that so many are so supportive ‚ù§ I don't feel comfortable putting my beadwork online because it means a lot to me and it would absolutely crush me if someone copied it or reposted it without permission or used it to scam others. I only sell locally to where I am. But others have posted their info on the thread if you'd like to check them out. Instagram also has a lot of creators who post their work.

33,AITA for sharing the news that I am pregnant with a girl and ‚Äúdevastating‚Äù a former friend?,10515,Not the A-hole,699,hpwyvq,1594599304.0,"I (36F) was best friends with Georgia (36F) since we were 5. Even from an early age Georgia competed with me on inconsequential things. The level of our friendship varied throughout the years of college and slightly after, but we became best friends again in our mid to late 20s. 

Georgia and I got engaged around the same time (once I announced, she set her wedding date 2 weeks before mine and picked the same vendors I had...then wore a white dress to my wedding, just to give you an idea). Whatever. We both started TTC at the same time. She got pregnant on her first try and stopped talking to me because ‚Äúit would have been too awkward.‚Äù I was going through extensive infertility treatments (that didn‚Äôt result in a child) that she never asked about.

My husband had a psychotic break and my once-loving marriage spiraled into horrible physical, emotional, and financial abuse. I reached out to her for help and she said she was too busy with her baby. She never contacted me again, and I didn‚Äôt reach out either. I was fine with the outcome, learned to never keep a friendship like that again, got out of my marriage, and went on to find a wonderful man who is now my husband. 

My husband and I also had to go through fertility treatments and we are cautiously optimistic with our chances for bringing home a baby as I‚Äôm now 8 weeks pregnant through IVF. We haven‚Äôt told most people, but I happened to run into an old family friend, Judy, in my hometown and ended up sharing the news. I also shared we were having a girl, which we know because of genetic testing.

Apparently the small town gossip still runs deep, because the next day I got a scathing email from Georgia about how she heard from Judy that I was having a girl and demanding to know why I was rubbing it in her face because I KNOW she had two boys now and her third pregnancy is ALSO a boy and they‚Äôve been ‚Äúwaiting for their girl and she‚Äôs in therapy because she hasn‚Äôt gotten one yet.‚Äù She went on to accuse me of always trying to one-up her.

I wasn‚Äôt going to write back but decided to try to be the bigger person and just said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry that the news you heard from Judy was difficult for you to hear. I was simply sharing news of my life and had no idea you were struggling with gender [note: I know it‚Äôs sex not gender but she used gender and I didn‚Äôt want to correct her] disappointment. I was so pleased to hear from your email that you‚Äôve gotten the large family you always hoped for, and I hope you and Husband can make peace with the beautiful family you created.‚Äù

My email was then shared to all our former mutual friends and several emailed me to tell me what Georgia had done and that they stood up for me and are so happy for me, but one friend and *Georgia‚Äôs mom* emailed ripping me a new one about how callous I am. I‚Äôm used to being gaslit from my ex husband and am now questioning if I somehow am the asshole for casually sharing our news and not thinking about any potential repercussions.",False,False,2020-07-12 17:15:04
34,AITA For not inviting my parents and brothers to my wedding because they do not approve of my fiance?,10364,Not the A-hole,1007,hrknws,1594834985.0,"Let me start this off by saying I have always been very close to my direct family, up until about 3 years ago, which is when I(Now 27) introduced my girlfriend(Now 24) to them.

My sister immediatly became best friends with her, my uncles and aunts loved her, basically the entire family loved her apart from my brothers and my parents, especially my mom.

Since that I started distancing myself because they would often talk about how she is not right for me, how I should find a better girl, how she was rude, slutty and so on, I honestly did not get it, she was always on her best behavior, but when questioning them about it I would never get a straight answer as to why they acted like they did. Luckily though they would never do it infront of her, they were just a bit cold you know? However the rest of my family was lovely to her so it made up for a lot and I became much closer to my uncles, aunts and sister as a result.

Now after 3 years of that behavior and me basically cutting them off apart from big holidays because of it I finally found out why they act like they do because they finally told my sister. Apparantly my mom knows my now Fiance's former stepdad who revealed my girlfriend was a stripper for a few months during college(We're talking at 19 before we even met). I was aware of this and honestly I don't really care, we all did shit we aren't proud off when younger and this is not even something that weird either. But apparantly in my mom and brothers mind that immediatly meant she was a no good slutty girl who was looking for a provider to bleed dry and it was their job to ""protect"" me.

I am just amazed at the sheer damn stupidity of it and I am honestly seething, as a result we decided not to invite them to our wedding(Wedding wont be for months), after all why would they wanna celebrate my marriage to her, right?

Meanwhile I just invited a load of extra friends and extended family of course also invited my sister, uncles and aunts and so forth. To put it bluntly, pretty much my entire family is invited apart from my parents and brothers. As you probably expected my mom called me sobbing when she found out and I gave her a piece of my mind about everything, including that I found out why their behavior had been so shitty before just dropping the call and blocking her. My dad and brothers have been raging at everyone who will listen as expected. But what really makes me doubt myself is my Uncle told me I am wayyyyy tooharsh and should really reconsider if I want to lose my parents over this.

So here I am to see what random strangers think.

35,AITA not accepting olive branch from my sister,10008,Not the A-hole,1081,hosn8u,1594429281.0,"I (37F) have 2 sisters, Roxanne (34) and Libby (22). When we were 25, 22 and 10, my dad sadly passed away. Around that time, my mom became very anxious about what would happen to Libby if something happened to her (she had my aunt as a potential guardian, but she is located pretty far away from us, and it would have meant uprooting Libby). She approached me and Roxanne and asked if one or both of us would be willing to take custody of Libby (with help from my aunt). Roxanne immediately said no, which was understandable as she was in her early 20s. I said yes as I was more established.

A few years later, my mom passed due to cancer, and I became Libby's guardian. Mom left me the house entirely, and split her savings into some for me and some for a college fund for Libby. Her jewelry was split evenly amongst me, Libby and Roxanne.

Libby got into college, and her fund was enough to cover the tuition, but not living expenses. I reached out to Roxanne to ask if she could help. She is very well off due to her profession and having no debt from my parents paying for her college. She said no. Okay, fair enough. However she got incredibly angry with me that I would ask after inheriting 'everything' and told me I was greedy and money hungry. I pointed out that the house was to ensure Libby got to stay where she grew up, and the money Mom left me was meant to help with related expenses. She told me never to ask her for money again, called Libby a bunch of nasty names, saying she always hated her, that Libby was the favorite child, that she (Roxanne) got neglected after Libby was born (not true). She cut us off after that.

About 4 years have passed since then. Recently she reached out, asking if we could talk, and I said no. I am perfectly happy without her, Libby is doing well, my aunt and I split the expenses to get her through college. It was definitely a bit hard for us, but worth it. However Roxanne has been telling our aunt that we're excluding her, that she wants a relationship, and aunt has been telling us that forgiveness is good, family is important and all that. I just don't need the bad vibes. AITA for not accepting this olive branch?

EDIT: So I wanted to address a couple recurring comments. 

1. The estate was really just personal effects, the house, and a small amount of savings, as most of it had already been used for medical care. I relied on my own salary to take care of myself and my sister.
2. My house is not worth millions lol. It is a modest 3 bed 2 bath in a suburb. My parents were frugal, saved a lot, that's how they sent all of us to college.
3. Libby and Roxanne have never been close. Roxanne outright hated Libby when she was little, and it simmered down to tolerance as Libby got older. When Roxanne left for college, she never really kept in touch with Libby. After our parents both passed, I would email her a few times a month to make sure she was doing okay. 
4. Libby knows some of what Roxanne said because she saw the messages that she sent. 
5. I apologise for coming off as callous and uncaring towards Roxanne. I understand she has had her issues and was grieving too, but I never really had time to be in my feelings like that, so it's hard for me to relate.",False,1594429251.0,2020-07-10 18:01:21
36,AITA for leaving most of my money to my wife/charity?,9660,Not the A-hole,668,hqycrb,1594747249.0,"Edited to add: my wife an I decided early on to have separate finances(as we never planned on having children) and my wife is incredibly well off in her own right(like owning a small plane levels of well off), where we live typically everything you own goes to your partner/children, but my wife and i decided that while I would leave her about 1/3 of my total wealth, she didn't need anything else and she would prefer that I set up my nephews and nieces and support the groups we believe in. In addition, as an only child she has been told that she will be the sole inheritor of her parents estate and owns multiple successful small businesses. If this wasn't the case then I absolutely would have left her everything I own.

About 4 years ago I was diagnosed with a type of blood cancer, not going to get into specifics but I decided(being 36 at the time and full of youthful energy haha), to follow a very aggressive surgery/chemo pattern. It appeared to work and i have been going on about my life the last 3 years as though it never happened. 

Important to note that when i was diagnosed, both my siblings had announced pregnancies recently and my mother was in hospital after a stroke so rather than dump my news on everyone it was kept between my wife and i. Then by the time that it seemed fair to break the news to them i was improving and there seemed no reason to distress them.

About 7 months ago I started to get the same symptoms I'd had last time and I went in to get checked out. Basically I have several aggressive tumors and ive been given 2-5 years to live depending on what kind of treatment I want to follow. I've decided that I dont want to pursue treatment and instead I just want to spend as much of my time with my wife who has suffered terribly through this whole ordeal.

Because I now have a time limit on my life I broke the news to my family about 3 months ago. They were all understandably upset, particularly my father who i have always been particularly close to. 

Now when I was 20 I was gifted(as were both my siblings) $45,000 to do with whatever I wanted. I used the money to invest in property and my business as a builder(I had just finished an apprenticeship and struck out on my own). I now own more than 20 properties(most of which are rented for income) and a business that imployes 27 people(including my wife, who has a masters in business and runs admin). As well as a considerable amount of wealth in investments/vintage cars. 

I had decided that after I die the business, 3 rental homes, our beach house and the home we live in, along with several investments will be left to my wife. I have been married for 19 years and I feel like its the least I can do for the support she has given me over the years.  
I will be leaving each of my nephews and nieces(all under 7) $20k in an investment account that they can access when they are 20.
The rest will be put into a trust fund that will issue out a set amount every year to various groups i like to support, including one that teaches underprivileged kids the skills to become tradesmen and also to the hospital that has treated me over the last few years(we arent in the US by the way).

I was telling one of my siblings this recently and she got upset that, as she put it ""everyone is getting something except me and our brother"". I tried to explain that both my siblings are well off in their own rights and our parents are very comfortably retired so I don't believe they need additional support. Since then she and our other sibling have been upset with me, we are still talking but they are curt and cold. AITA?",False,1594760148.0,2020-07-14 10:20:49

She spent $200 last month on gifts for some woman who posts videos of her dog. Most of the items were for the woman like a bag. I told my wife she was crazy and we got in a fight over it.

38,AITA for not butchering my native language to please my nonbinary friend?,9129,Not the A-hole,335,hr56kh,1594774626.0,"Repost because I messed up the title on my first try

In one of my group of friends, in which we are mainly gay guys, one of us recently identified themselves as non-binary. I have no problem with this, and I use their preferred pronouns and suffix (In Spanish it is made adding an E instead of A or O: Ele, amigue, hije, compa√±ere)

What is the problem? Since ""coming out‚Äù, they are trying to force us to use inclusive language for EVERYTHING. For you to get a better idea, in Spanish most nouns are gendered and we don‚Äôt have a ""neutral"" article.

The chair = La silla (Female), The shoe = El zapato (Male), Cat = Gato (Male) or Gata (Female)

Their idea of inclusive language means butchering the words and using the article ""ele"" for all that has no specified gender.

The chair = Ele sille or sillx, The shoe = Ele zapate or zapatx, Cat = Ele Gate o gatx

It has gotten to the point we can't no longer say ""Hola chicos"" (Hi guys) or ""Hola amigos"" (Hi friends) in our group chat without them jumping because we are excluding them. (In Spanish, the male forms are used for mixed groups and generalizations)

Hearing them speak or reading their messages has become a torture because it barely sounds like Spanish anymore, and they are always mad that I refuse to speak in this weird jargon. Some of my friends are on my side, but the others say we should just play along with my friend as they believe it is just a way they are using for getting a better hold of their new identity and looking for our support.

I support them, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I will destroy the Spanish language for them.

My brother (B) and SIL married right out of high school and started having kids young. I‚Äôm very close to all my niblings and try to be the ‚Äúcool aunt‚Äù when I can.

B and SIL are pretty socially conservative. They have five kids and all have been homeschooled and attend church regularly, but they socialize with other homeschooled kids and aren‚Äôt too sheltered.

N is gonna start college in the fall and she‚Äôs a little nervous. She‚Äôs never had a serious boyfriend and is pretty shy. She tends to talk to me about stuff she‚Äôs embarrassed to ask her parents, which I‚Äôm fine with. She‚Äôs more like a little sister to me than a niece.

Recently she‚Äôs asked me some questions about reproductive health. She wants to start birth control cause she gets really bad cramps, but her mother told her that BC will also make her gain a lot of weight and cause fertility issues. I was kinda stunned when she said this.

I told her no, that‚Äôs not the case. I also told her about alternatives. I asked what else she may have wanted to know cause I figured there might be blind spots other places.

She had no idea how condoms worked, thought sex would hurt the first several times no matter what, didn‚Äôt know about toxic shock, and was unaware of what a pap/mam was. Obviously she knew how sex and babies work, but not the nuances of it.

I ended up telling her how to make a Dr appt for contraceptives and told her how to get referred to a gyn. I‚Äôm not ashamed of sex or helping my niece, but I don‚Äôt like overstepping bounds so I told my SIL about the questions and my concerns about the misinformation she was telling her kids. (I didn‚Äôt mention the Dr appts, that‚Äôs none of her business).

SIL ended up getting really angry and told me I had no right telling her daughter that kind of stuff. I told her she was an adult and had a right to information. B and SIL are very ‚Äúmy house, my rules‚Äù and are adamant that while N lives with them she won‚Äôt need that kind of info. To SIL, an ob/gyn is only for women who are sexually active/expecting, and BC is only for preventing pregnancy. I told her that was a load of shit and a good way for them to have an accidental grandbaby sooner rather than later.

SIL told me not to parent her kids for her, and ended up telling B who said I shouldn‚Äôt be talking about ‚Äúperverse‚Äù things with his kid.

Aita here?

Edit: just to be clear! I didn‚Äôt tell her all the details of the convo. SIL has four other kids and I was worried about them getting the same wrong info. I just said N came to me about bad cramp relief and asked if she said BC caused infertility. The conversation escalated from there.

Edit 2: y‚Äôall are making a bunch of wild assumptions, but this is reddit so what did I expect. N has spoken to me since this happened... no negative repercussions for her.

I‚Äôve spent years coaxing her out of bed, trying to be supportive and understanding, help her develop good habits, but over time, she said I developed into more of a parent. I didn‚Äôt want that so I backed off. 

She developed this really annoying habit of setting lots of really annoying alarms every couple minutes so that she is forced to wake up. But they don‚Äôt work. She sleeps right through them. They wake me up and make my mornings absolutley miserable. I typically wake her up angrily, which I know I shouldn‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs loud, constant blaring first thing in the mornings and it makes me insane. And it‚Äôs a different alarm every She doesn‚Äôt even hear it. 

I‚Äôve tried reasoning with her, coming up with compromises, threatening to sleep in the guest bedroom, but nothing works. She says that I‚Äôm treating her like a child and it makes her feel disrespected. I feel disrespected that I keep getting forcibly woken up and she isn‚Äôt making a change. One morning I saw her wake up, disable her alarms and go right back to sleep. I had to wake her up so she wouldn‚Äôt miss work. She didn‚Äôt remember doing it. 

One morning, one of her hundreds of klaxons rang in my ear and scared me to death. I turned over and saw her groggily disabling her alarms and rolled back over and went back to sleep. That was the final straw. I did the exact same thing. About an hour goes by before her boss calls her asking where she is. Needless to say she was livid with me when she got home. She said I should have just woken her up, but I held my ground and told her this cycle of behavior was done.

Two day‚Äôs ago I was gifted a cake from a student. It was delicious and beautifully made.

Normally I put up little post it notes on my food which I usually find in the trash after my sisters eaten the item. This time though I forgot about the note and put the cake in the fridge.

I broke this rule during college entrance exams. I got into the top university in my country (I prepared for 2 years to achieve that). Even though my score was good my sister cried and threw a tantrum about how embarrassed she would feel if I went to a better college than her. So, I was forced to attend the subpar college she attended. 

Now that I was finally away from home, I worked and saved up. I also did my best to prepare for campus job interviews. Right before I stared attending job interviews my father called to tell me that I cannot get a job until my sister does. This pissed me off to no extent. I ignored him. I landed an amazing job and moved to another state right after my college ended. I have been low contact since then. 

They gave a police complaint saying that I was missing. They tried to call my company to tell them to fire me so that I can return home. I am now married and I live with my husband.

I then got a call from my thanking me for the money and asking when was my nephew receiving his share, I told him I had nothing saved up for him since I only made a deal with my niece.

48,AITA for telling my therapist she's not worth $200/hr?,14429,Not the A-hole,1050,hrw3p0,1594875951.0,"(edited a lot for word count)

I started seeing a therapist 3 yrs ago. In time, I felt she wasn't a great fit or a great therapist. Reasons:

1. She was chronically late, even though she had lunch before my session. We regularly started 10 minutes late (or more!); a big deal when I'm coming in the middle of my work day and can‚Äôt stay late, which I DID call out and request time added to the next session, which she did NOT like.
2. She kept pushing practices on me that I don‚Äôt use. I got tired of saying ""After X stressful thing happened, I meditated for 10 mins and felt much better"" and her saying ""Did you try Y? Next time try Y instead of meditation"". Why would I do that? I'm doing something that works and I'm comfortable with - why keep pushing something else?
3. She felt like she was just phoning it in a lot. In the beginning, she felt engaged and like she was paying attention AND pushing me to improve my mental health. But over time, it didn‚Äôt feel like she was helping me anymore.

I started to think I should look elsewhere for therapy. Then a bizarre situation with billing came up this year: she wanted to know what my total deductible was and for me to pay her $200/session until my entire deductible was filled, THEN switch to the lesser payments once my coverage took over. I was seeing other specialists during this time; those visits were also  taken out of my deductible. Her wanting me to pay her my entire deductible made no sense and was going to cost me more money. We got that straightened out, but that was the nail on the coffin and I was going to look for a new therapist and drop her. Then corona happened, and I thought that it might be better to stay for now, though the therapy continued to be lackluster.

Last session she announced that she's opting out of taking insurance So in some months, I'd need her to pay her whole fee ($200) myself. I said that I'd have to end our relationship; I am seeing an in-network therapist because of money. She then said ""Well, I think I'm worth $200/hr"" to which I said ""I don't"".

I feel like a total asshole for saying that. The silence was thunderous.

While kicking myself repeatedly I weakly told her that I had felt for some time like maybe our connection wasn't the greatest and that while I wished her individual practice well, I couldn't afford it and didn't feel like our connection had been that great for awhile, so it's probably best to end there.

We hung up on that note but she texted me after, asking for reasons. I mentioned the above points, and she pushed back, saying I should have said something. But I DID call out 1 & 2 in the moment. She pushed back more, so I said ""I apologize for hurting your feelings. I wish you and your practice all the best, but I don't have anything further to say"" and put her on mute.

AITA? I do wish I'd have handled it better. But at the same time, I think I did address most of our issues head-on, and she didn't want to hear them.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all SO MUCH (especially the therapists!) for your support and pointing out that her ""I'm worth $200"" was completely unprofessional and uncalled for. Also for pointing out that the texting afterwards was wildly unprofessional and not something a therapist should do. FTR, this is the first time either of us ever texted each other and the message wasn't ""Got your message that we won't be doing therapy this week, see you next week!"". 

I wanted to mention a few other things that came up repeatedly in the comments. She was a really good therapist for longer than the first year AND we had two conversations about the deductible that were completely normal. So the start (and a large part) of our relationship was very good and I made great progress with her for quite a while. She helped me out enormously at first and even when things originally went a bit downhill, she was helping me and seemed like she was still a solid therapist. 

The other thing was a few people pointing out that me shooting down her suggestions may make her disengage. To be clear, I only shot down the suggestions she made about me changing behaviors that were working well for me. If I came to her with a behavior or thought pattern that was not working for me, and she had suggestions, I was willing to try them until I found something that works. But if she wanted me to change a behavior that had helped me for years - why would I do that? Every other therapist I've ever gone to worked on top of a foundation of whatever already worked for me. So long as it wasn't an unhealthy behavior, I've never had a therapist push me away from doing something that helps me to try something new. 

Anyways, I feel much about really knowing that her behavior really wasn't OK on multiple levels. I've had therapists before that I didn't click with, but I've never had one that did anything unethical or unprofessional before, and this ending was a sad shitty end to what had been a really productive relationship.

She didn‚Äôt get very far and was brought back to us again. 

The week after that I told her that since she can‚Äôt be trusted not to run away or steal she had to come into the service with us. She could have her headphones in and listen to music, but she had to be sitting next to us. Our case worker told us that this was an acceptable consequence because of her past behavior. We went and she sat in the service the whole time listening to music on her phone, but she wasn‚Äôt happy about it. I explained to her that once we were able to trust her not to try and run away when she wasn‚Äôt supervised she could stay home or go with the other girls. 

H is a good girl, and is for the most part well behaved. Like the other three girls she is in therapy but she just seems to not want to stay with any home that cares about her. I was having a conversation with a friend of my husband who also fosters ( younger kids under 10 ). I told him about how H had to go to church with us because of her past behavior and how we are hoping we can work through whatever feelings she has and hopefully stop her from running. Friend told us that it was wrong to have H come to church with us when she didn‚Äôt want to go and we should just let her stay home. He‚Äôs never had a child with a history of running so I don‚Äôt think he understood the situation. We ended up getting into an argument about it because we live close to a big city where sex trafficking is common. I honestly care about H and I don‚Äôt want anything to happen to her. He eventually told me that we were bad foster parents because H kept running away and it must be something we are doing. AITA for forcing H to come to church?

Edit-
Hello! This blew up way more than I thought it would! I‚Äôm getting a lot of repeat questions and I‚Äôm struggling to answer them all! Here are a couple of the common ones,

Where is she running? 
  She doesn‚Äôt really have a PLACE she‚Äôs going to, she‚Äôs mostly just running for the sake of running. Currently we think she is running because she WANTS to be found, because if she really wanted to leave us we wouldn‚Äôt have found her so easily these past two times. 

Can one of you stay home and the other go to church? 
   Right now, her caseworker believes that us disrupting our entire family routine to keep her home and prevent her from running away gives her control and authority over the family. She wants H to be as much part of the family‚Äôs routine as possible to try and show her that we care.",False,1594473646.0,2020-07-10 20:13:22

I went to her car and it was there. I brought it inside showing my sister that it had my name written on the bottom. She said I had just done that. but it had actually been on for 3 years. she said they practically own it now since I left it a year ago. I said no, I just let them borrow it. I took it and went home later getting multiple calls from siblings aunts and uncles saying I stole from my own nephews. AITA here because I kinda feel like one.

51,WIBTA for giving back an expensive gift because it was used?,7187,Not the A-hole,688,hqdut8,1594669786.0,"So, a few years ago my mom bought herself a necklace pendant for $ 300,- it was a diamond, but  clunky and to be honest quite ugly. She consulted me when buying and I told her that it was ugly and to look elsewhere. But she is a bit of a cheapskate and didn't want to spend more. 

So she bought it. 

My dad is a very outspoken person and told he outright that it was ugly and that she should have simply spend the extra cash for something actually pretty. 

A few years fast forward. 

A couple of months ago I noticed she had a new pendant. This one was really nice. I complimented her on it and asked her what happened to the old ugly one. 

She said she had returned it. I was surprised that that was even possible but shrugged it off.

Fast forward again to my university graduation ceremony. While my parents were never supportive of my degree they told me how proud they were and gave me a gift. 

Before that they had accidentally forgotten to give me something for my primary, middle and high school graduating (contrary to my sisters and even my cousins got something from my parents) 

I should note here that my grades were either the same as or better than my siblings and cousins

So I was positively surprised that they hadn't ""forgotten"" again. 

When I opened it though it was my mom's ugly pendant with a necklace. 

They hadn't given it back because the shop wouldn't take it back after 5 years (I asked at the shop). So the pawned it off as a present to me.

I didn't want to embarrass them in front of my best friend so I acted if I hadn't noticed it was her old one.  (I don't usually pay attention on other's peoples jewelry so my parents could have truly assumed I didn't notice)

However it just doesn't seem to let me go. I feel like just returning it to them and telling me that they can keep it because if an old ugly clunker is all the appreciation they can show for my masters degree then I don't need their appreciation at all. 

So WIBTA if I did just that? Or am I being an ungreatful snowflake?



I should add: my parents did not pay for my degree, my lodgings, food anything really. They did however repeatedly try to sabotage my degree.",False,False,2020-07-13 12:49:46
52,AITA for abandoning my pregnant friend?,7222,Not the A-hole,558,hrkohw,1594835075.0,"FINAL EDIT/UPDATE

Thank you all so, so much for your kind words and also your insight into the situation. I've not been able to reply to you all but I have read every single comment. To those of you who have commented with your own experiences of miscarriage/stillbirth/deaths of children, please know that my heart breaks for you, and I wish you all the best as you heal.

 I've had a long chat with my husband and we've decided the following:

1) we're going to give my friend some money towards some of the bigger things. This won't be a lot as we don't have a lot to give, but I want to support her. She's a single mum-to-be in the middle of a pandemic and that must be terrifying.

2) I've put together a list of charities etc that may be able to help her going forward as the money we give her will not pay for everything. This list also includes people who can advise her on what benefits she is entitled to etc.

3) with these things I am also writing a letter telling her how much she has hurt me during what is easily the worst thing I have ever experienced in my life. It will gently suggest that she gets some support with her finances through benefits and budgeting tools etc, and makes it clear that this is the last handout she can expect from my husband and I. It will also suggest that she needs to get some therapy for everything she's been through, and that I will support her through this. 

I'm hoping that this will be enough to keep our friendship, god knows I need all the love and support I can get at the moment. If not, I think I can at least say I've done everything I can.

Throwaway, on mobile etc.

I don't think I'm the ass here but maybe I could have handled it better. My head is all over the place.

Ten months ago, I (28F) got pregnant with my first child. Baby was planned and husband and I were overjoyed. Five months into my pregnancy, my closest friend (22F) announced that she too was pregnant. Unfortunately, her partner did a runner as soon as he heard the news and, while she's a very capable person she's understandably quite daunted at the thought of bringing up a child on her own. She also has no family support due to a rough upbringing so I was her main support (couldn't go to appointments with her due to covid) but I'd stand outside and wait and was always at the end of the phone. We'd talk excitedly about our kids growing up together etc.

Seven months into my pregnancy I experienced some bleeding and went to hospital. An emergency C-section later and my beautiful baby girl was placed in my arms. Stillborn. I had to do this alone as due to covid my husband was not allowed in, although they did move me to another room later so I could see him and we could say goodbye to our daughter together.

About a week later, my friend called me (we'd spoken briefly after I gave birth but she wanted to give me some space, which I appreciated). She was very kind and sympathetic, but then we got onto the subject of what I was going to do with my daughter's things (cot, clothes, toys we'd bought in preparation etc). I said I hadn't been able to think about that yet and she said that she was really struggling to buy everything she needed and could we give everything to her as we won't be needing it?

I know on a practical level that makes sense but I don't know that I'm ready to part with anything yet. The more practical stuff like breast pumps and nappies etc she can have no problem but, I'd imagined putting my baby to bed in that cot and watching her play with her toys and I just don't think I can purge the house of everything just yet. I said this to my friend and she accused me of being selfish and uncaring, it's not like we're going to be using it and she's a single mother etc. She slammed down the phone and we haven't spoken since.

I feel terrible because I know she's struggling but my heart is so broken and I can't see anything with clarity because my grief is so all-consuming. AITA?

EDIT: Firstly, thank you all so much for your condolences and support, it means so much. I've stopped replying to everyone because I'm a little fragile and was getting overwhelmed, I'm sorry. But I really am so grateful. Also thank you to whoever gave me an award, that was kind.

Secondly, a few of you have suggested that my friend doesn't have anyone because of how she treats people, so I want to give a bit of background here. She was very badly abused in pretty much every way possible growing up and so went NC with family as soon as she could. The trauma of what she went through has, I think, led to her having problems forming healthy relationships and could be why few people have stuck around. Due to the horrendous conditions in which she grew up she has had to be practical to the point of being mercenary in order to survive, and while I'm not sure if it excuses her behaviour I think it goes a long way towards explaining it. I'm probably the most stable influence in her life and I really worry and care about her.",False,1594902525.0,2020-07-15 10:44:35
53,AITA for getting angry at my mom for suggesting my attire is seductive to my dad???,6778,Not the A-hole,377,hotm6l,1594432433.0,"As the title suggests, I can't believe I'm actually making this post. Throwaway account obviously.

I (23F) have always disagreed with my mother (60F) on various things politically, but I'm not going to detail them here because I don't think they are very relevant to the discussion at hand. She's just a really conservative woman is the background I'm trying to provide here. We are not religious.

Anyways, today I walked downstairs to make breakfast for both of us in my nightgown (just a plain one, nothing funky, not see-through obviously) and shorts. My entire chest was covered to the neck nor was I showing shoulders. She stared at me for a while, and commented that I should not walk down like ""I'm not wearing anything underneath"" as my dad (63M, we have an ordinary relationship) may see it and get ideas. I was shocked and said, 1 I am wearing nothing revealing (not a bikini suit) and 2 it's very disturbing that she would suggest my dad would get incestuous thoughts from looking at his damn daughter. She got defensive and backtracked saying it's just not in accordance with her views and ""men would be men"" and to which point I had enough and blew up at her, saying I couldn't believe she would suggest her husband and daughter would have such thoughts just because I wore something that is as short to my thighs. I said ""If it bothers you SO MUCH I'll just go change into long pants and a shirt in this 40 C summer weather"". Now she's saying I over-reacted and put words in her mouth and think I'm the AH. My dad is not home yet and I am honestly way too embarrassed to bring this up and hope that she doesn't either. AITA?

Edit: Many people are asking me to consider the possibility if my mother was sexually abused in the past, perhaps by her own family. Obviously I wasn't there throughout her childhood so I can never say anything with 100% certainty but she has a very close relationship with her parents even till today. She calls them once or twice every week for hours. They spoiled her rotten since the minute she was born. I grew up with my maternal grandparents until I was 6 and merely speaking out of my own experience, I never had any inappropriate encounters with any men in my family from either side. I guess she has just never really had the need grow up because she got spoiled by her father, and then by her husband. There is a lot of gossip in my extended family that she is the real child of our household because when she gets upset everyone has to do things her way.

Edit 2: Some people asked why I would bother posting a question thinking there's a possibility I'm the AH. One, I come from a traditional East Asian household where children are expected to be obedient to their parents even into adulthood. Two, I was wondering if I overreacted by blowing up and yelling, or just made a huge deal out of ""nothing"" in general.

54,AITA for forcing my cousin to pay back what he stole despite it possibly causing him and his family financial destitution?,6701,Not the A-hole,1122,hqcli2,1594663345.0,"If I am being honest, I don't think that this dilemma is all that contentious. I'm fairly confident that I am in the right. But my actions have received a lot of flak from many members of my extended family. So here I am.

I recently had a watch stolen after I hosted a get together for my cousins and myself. This particular watch is an expensive gift (\~ $15,000 AUD) from my partner to commemorate a major milestone. It wasn't until I informed my cousins that I will have to report this incident to the police in order to file an insurance claim did one of my cousins - Damian - confess.

Damian purports that he stole the watch so that he could use the proceeds of its sale to assist his family who were financially devastated by COVID-19. He had hoped that my insurance would make me whole, thereby making this a victimless crime. As you can tell, Damian isn't the brightest kid; had he been any plainer, his parents would have to water him thrice a week.

Fortunately, Damian was still holding onto the measly $3,000 he decided to sell the watch for. So I dragged him to the place he sold the watch hoping that the owner would be reasonable. Unfortunately, the owner was not reasonable. The owner wanted either $12,000 for the watch, or documentation proving that the watch was stolen.

The actions I took next may seem harsh, especially when those actions are taken against a family in financial strife. But for context, Damian and I aren't close. I don't owe him or his family anything. And while I do feel bad for whatever troubles his family is facing, there's a myriad of ways he could have helped his family without stealing a highly sentimental item from me.

So I gave Damian an ultimatum: he had a week to come up with the money needed to buy back my watch, or I go to the police. He cried and begged me to just look the other way as he had no way to come up with the money and that a criminal record will likely extinguish his aspirations of a legal career. But frankly, I don't see how any of that is my problem.

Damian then ran to his parents who had the audacity to accost me at my own home calling me all sorts of names that I wasn't aware I went by. Surprisingly, even my extended family at large sided with Damian. Apparently, I am putting a ""useless bauble"" over the livelihood of my own flesh and blood - don't mind the fact that that flesh and blood has never done anything for me.

I can't believe it has come to this. Not only is Damian getting away with his theft, but somehow he managed to make me face the music that he wrote! Despite my ultimatum, I have let my extended family pressure me into delaying my actions for almost a fortnight now. But I am at my wits' end and will be going to the police as soon as possible. But it never hurts to get a reality check; so AITA?

Edit 1:

\- I'm unsure exactly how old Damian is, but he is in his first year of university so presumably 17-19.

\- I do have the box and papers proving that I am the watch's original owner (or rather my partner is). However, that isn't sufficient proof to obligate the dealer to return the watch to me. All those papers prove is that I was once the owner of the watch, not that I am the current owner. I cannot coerce the dealer into relinquishing the watch unless I provide him proof that the watch has been stolen from me.

\- Americans really think ""fortnight"" is the fanciest term, huh? It may blow your mind to know that ""fortnight"" forms the basic vocabulary of even the average 5 year old in Australia.

Edit 2: I realised how my comment regarding the term ""fortnight"" may come across to new readers who aren't aware of the context. The short of it is a lot of commenters are accusing me of making this up. To substantiate their conclusion, they claim that no one would use ""fancy"" terms like ""fortnight"". So my comment above is to educate those people that ""fortnight"" isn't really a fancy term at all in some parts of the world.

Last weekend my partner and sister in law went bra shopping together. My sister in law is a very, very large girl, she is around 5ft and 150kgs (she always talks about her weight) and none of her current bras fit her anymore, so she asked if my gf could help her out in finding something for her size that would fit. My gf pleased to help her, so she took some time out of her day to take my sister in law shopping for some new bras. My gf is a small girl, around 4ft 8 and 45kgs (this is relevant) 

So they finally find some bras that fit my sister in law and while bra shopping my gf decides to buy some new bras as she found a few she really loved. I then came to pick them both up after shopping (busses and parking is terrible here) 

During the drive home my sister in law is boasting about her massive boobs and asked my gf what her boob size was. Now my gf is a small girl and her boobs are in proportion for her body, but you know how girls can be and like most girls my gf is also self conscious at times about her smaller boobs. Anyways my gf tells my sister in law her size and my sister in law yells out laughing ""haha you totally have no tits, I feel sorry for your bf (me) for having a flat chested gf)

Let's just say my gf was upset. I was pissed off. This is where I could have been the asshole for letting my sister in law then know that the only reason her boobs have grown so much is because of her recent weight gain over the last few months and that is nothing to be boasting about. I then reassured my gf that her boobs are perfect and I wouldn't want her gaining a lot of weight just to have some so called big tits.

Well as you can imagine my sister in law was pissed at me. When we got back home she left and hasn't talked to myself or my gf since.

I (19f) have been dealing with some pain in/around my ovaries. I can‚Äôt see my doctor in person right now, so the doctor is just having me do whatever I can at home. One of the things she wanted me to do was to start taking ovulation tests, so I can know exactly when I‚Äôm ovulating (to see if the pain might be related to ovulation, I guess?). I bought the tests and used one for the first time a few days ago. Also, I did mention this to my mom. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what I said, but I mentioned ovulation tests and she seemed fine with it.

My mom ended up finding the test in the garbage can, and assumed that it was a pregnancy test (which is understandable, it‚Äôs nearly identical). The test was positive and she flipped out; started calling me a whore and a slut, a liar, said she didn‚Äôt know I had been ‚Äúgoing out and fucking douchebags,‚Äù and a lot of other horrible things. She then went in her bedroom and cried. During this whole thing, I was yelling and trying to explain that it was NOT a pregnancy test and my mom knows damn well that there‚Äôs no possible way I could be pregnant. Besides the fact that I‚Äôm a virgin.. I‚Äôm also a lesbian lol. My mom knows both of those things, and she also knows that I haven‚Äôt left the house since March. So unless I‚Äôve been hiding a pregnancy for 4-5 months or longer, it‚Äôs literally impossible. 

When she finally stopped wailing long enough to listen, I explained the whole thing and that I definitely wasn‚Äôt pregnant. She told me to go away and now has not spoken to me in 2 days. Apparently she thought it would be a good idea to make a Facebook post about this, so she wrote a fucking novel about what a horrible daughter I am for scaring her like that. She ‚Äúnearly had a heart attack‚Äù because she ‚Äúthought my sweet daughter was a whore.‚Äù Then she ranted about premarital sex and not having kids until I‚Äôm at least 25, which I thought was ironic because my mom was 18 when I was born, and I was like 3 months old at my parents‚Äô wedding. 

But now I have family members and cousins that I don‚Äôt even know messaging me about this!

I love my husband more than anyone in the world and I made sure to prioritize our marriage and not be one of *those* moms. My oldest son is 25 and just filed for divorce after four years of marriage. I really disliked my DIL for some personal reasons, but also I didn't like the way she treated my son. They have a beautiful three year old son, but she began to completely ignore my son when my grandson was born. She prided herself on being a working mom but couldn't juggle all three and my poor son was neglected.

Typically I would have more sympathy but she made a lot of derogatory comments about my parenting and marriage. She said she doesn't know how my husband and I could travel without the kids when they were young (one or two weeks a year and they were with their grandmother) She was insulting about the fact I baby my husband and he is a ""manchild"" and she embarrassed me at her bridal shower when she ASKED me for a piece of marriage advice and then told me it was bad advice and I'm just too old fashioned.

Well obviously this didn't all work out too well for her. I was ecstatic when my son told me they were divorcing. She also used her son as a pawn and was always giving me conditions and acting like she was doing me a favor. I'm kind of enjoying the fact she wanted me to have limited time with the kid and now I have him for a week at a time (my son is living with us) but I've tried very hard to bite my tongue.

She came over the other day to pick up her son and my son had left. He always leaves and makes me deal with her but that's a separate issue.

61,AITA for cleaning poop off my female friend,5702,Not the A-hole,1688,hpe2s1,1594517736.0,"I will try to make this short so here goes...

I am a 30 year old married man.  We recently had a party at our place for some close friends after CoVid. 7 of us total.  By different circumstances, we don‚Äôt have much family and we decided that we would be our ‚Äúbubble‚Äù of people that we would see during CoVid times.  Four woman and three guys.

Long story short, we drank quite a bit and everyone was planning at crashing at our place.  No big deal, nothing unusual.  The one girl there that recently became single drank a lot (likely due to the breakup) and passed out on the floor.  I moved her onto the couch near us so we could continue talking while monitoring her (didn‚Äôt want her to choke on puke or something).   Well, eventually she stirs, rolls over and reveals that she has pooped herself down her skirt and down her legs (also on my couch but it was a shitty couch; now it was a really shitty couch).

Everyone laughs at first then starts gagging.  The couples basically say that‚Äôs a sign the night is over and they start going to their rooms.  Well, I‚Äôm the lone holdout that we can‚Äôt just leave her covered in poop. My wife was too drunk to help and went to bed.

I was conflicted because this was a close friend so I did what I thought was best.  I grabbed baby wipes and cleaned her up. To be clear, I did not touch her vagina at all.  I did clean the poop off her butt and just quickly ran a wipe through her butt crack. (I‚Äôm a nurse so I have a super strong gag reflex.)

I slept on the couch next to her just in case I heard her choking.

Next morning everyone wakes up and comes to see their friend covered in poop.  Well she‚Äôs not anymore and that‚Äôs when it starts.  

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you did that‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs assault.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou basically groped her.‚Äù

My wife was no help, which hurt badly, and implied that I should have gotten her to do it.  Despite the fact that she was way too drunk to help.

I feel like my friends aren‚Äôt messaging me as much anymore and I‚Äôm being excluded.  Today was the final straw when I looked at my wife‚Äôs phone and saw a group chat of the girls and one of my best friends suggested the passed out girl file a police report.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.  I‚Äôm so frustrated because I tried to do the right thing.  I‚Äôm a god damned nurse, cleaning poop off someone is so clinical and practiced it‚Äôs almost routine at this point.

AITA?

TL;dr - cleaned poop off a drunk female friend now other friends are ostracizing me and basically labeling me a predator.

Edit: everyone is asking.

Not same couch.  Same room, different couch.  Sorry. That was vague. 

The girl who had the accident was horribly embarrassed the next day and left shortly after.  I didn‚Äôt harp on it because I was trying to not embarrass her even as everyone was calling me out.  I apologized day of, which in hindsight, kinda makes me look guilty of something.

Edit #2:  I didn‚Äôt expect this to become so big.  I had to sleep so that‚Äôs why the lack of replies.  Basically, I‚Äôll try to answer the questions I saw over and over. 

I am in Canada.  So when I said ‚Äúpost-CoVid‚Äù what I meant is my province is introducing social bubbles of people that interact with only those specific people.   I recognize that CoVid is a still very much a pandemic.

I‚Äôve also seen a lot of people mentioning that I should stop associating with those people.  This makes sense except for the fact (I‚Äôm not sure I mentioned) we all became close because we don‚Äôt have other family.  They are really all I have.  My wife was one of those close friends before we got married which is why she still has those private chats I guess.  We also have a young child together which is why I even had baby wipes in the first place.  So leaving my wife really isn‚Äôt an option I‚Äôm even entertaining despite the literal hole I feel in my chest over this.

And no, this may be a horrible thing, but I didn‚Äôt have permission to read my wife‚Äôs phone.  She got a message on her phone, I picked it up and it unlocked for my face.  (Her face unlocks my phone as well, we don‚Äôt really have secrets that way.). The messages were right there, roughly 10 back and forth, and I couldn‚Äôt help but read them.  I know that‚Äôs a violation of her privacy and I wouldn‚Äôt normally do that. 

I appreciate a lot of people saying that I was okay in my actions but this will be the last response I make on this.  The negative comments and messages I have been receiving privately are too much to take.  The positivity sent by some people is outstanding and I‚Äôm so thankful.  I can‚Äôt keep reading messages that I‚Äôm a rapist or that I sexually assaulted my friend.  After the pandemic, working insane hours, taking care of a
Baby and now this... I‚Äôm emotionally drained to a point I‚Äôve never been to.

Ever since I was in college, I grew a fascination for watches. I didn‚Äôt make much money while in college so I would spend money on watches around the 20-100 range at most. Once I graduated (in computer science) I got a nice job offer so I decided to spend my first couple paychecks on a nicer watch 4000 dollar range. 

I met my girlfriend and started dating her quickly around when I was 27. She‚Äôs a social worker so she‚Äôs making around 40k a year I‚Äôd say. I‚Äôm making around 130k. We decided to move in with each other and we rent an apartment together. We split the bills evenly for rent (place is not expensive) but I do generally pay for all our meals outside and do spend on random things like vacations for both of us since I do make more. 

Here‚Äôs our recent problem. I‚Äôve wanted a watch that‚Äôs generally around the 12-15k range since I started working. When I mentioned it to my gf a couple months back she thought it was silly to spend so much. I ultimately decided to buy the watch two weeks ago. I was so happy when I got it so I wore it and kept it on for several days. We hung out at her friends place and had a bbq with ten people (we all wore masks and social distanced). A friend of hers noticed my watch and got super annoying and judgmental for me buying the watch (it‚Äôs a Rolex so everyone knows the name and think they are super expensive). They asked how much it was and my gf said it‚Äôs over 10k. A couple of her friends really seemed concerned that I just blew that much money on a watch. I made the mistake of blurting out that I have several more cheaper watches in the 5k range after one of her friends asked my gf why she‚Äôd allow me to spend so much. 

Once we got home, my gf started crying and screaming at me for embarrassing her at her friends place and asked my why I wore my watch there. I was confused. She said that everyone there makes around as much as her and obviously wearing such an expensive watch around them was tacky and snobbiness. I told her I disagree. I worked hard for where I‚Äôm at and this watch to me symbolizes the effort I put it. It‚Äôs personal for me. I don‚Äôt go around telling everyone about my watch. I asked her what was the difference since one of her friends there was engaged and had a diamond ring on. My gf had no answer and now we haven‚Äôt spoken for two days.

Claire was the rebellious one growing up, hated any type of societal expectations, and Emma was much more conventional. Claire began dating her now husband when she went away to college and the first time she brought him home my husband was not happy. He had black nail polish and a streak in his hair. I actually had a conversation with my husband about how he can't be such a pompous ass and he is going to drive Claire away. Neither of us like her husband, but we try to bite our tongues. He did not ask my husband for her hand in marriage and when they told us they were engaged she already had a ring.

Emma also met her husband in college and he was much more clean cut and someone my husband would approve of. Emma's fiance came to us before he proposed and asked permission. This did endear him more to my husband and my husband told him that he had a family heirloom ring he had received in his mother's will and if he wanted to use it for Emma he could. It is a very expensive ring and it was left to my husband on the condition I never wear it (long story, MIL hated me) He did offer it to me but it didn't feel right. 

Emma's fiance accepted the ring and Claire found out and thinks that we punished her for making different choices, being with a man we don't like, and not going along with a ""sexist tradition"" I feel like it was my husband's ring to do what he wanted and since Claire's husband didn't tell us before he proposed, she already had a ring and we are not playing favorites.",False,False,2020-07-14 21:28:48

So my mom and dad divorced a long time ago, when I was 15. I‚Äôm 25 now. My mom also died 2 years ago from cancer. 

This past weekend I got emotional after talking to my siblings about mom so I found an old photo of us at the beach. I love this photo because it reminds me of our happy childhood and I love how my mom looked in it.

In the photo my dad has his arms around my mom and us kids are grinning in front of a huge sandcastle we all built together. It was really sweet and not at all romantic or anything so I set it as my profile pic on a messaging app I use to communicate with all family/friends. 

Not 24 hours later I get a passive aggressive text from my step mom about this photo. She said it‚Äôs shocking to see my current profile pic in a family group chat we‚Äôre all in together, that she can clearly see. She said it‚Äôs a slap in the face to see her husband with ‚Äúanother woman‚Äù after she fought so hard to legitimize their marriage. She said I should know better than to dig out a photo like that to parade in front of her.

I basically told her it‚Äôs none of her business what my profile is like and went back to sleep. I wake up to a torrent of texts from her, my dad, my stepsibs, and some relatives from her side of the family. Apparently stepmom had a full on breakdown while I was sleeping because she was convinced I did it on purpose to humiliate her. Everyone took her side because she lied and claimed I directly told her the photo was meant as an insult to her. 

I‚Äôm furious but I refuse to change the picture now. I was planning on changing it anyways but now that I‚Äôm pissed off I just want to keep it forever. AITA for acting this way?

I actually don't mind wearing bras because I'm small enough to where it doesn't really matter either way, but sometimes I just don't feel like putting one on.

My living room faces the street and has a giant window smack dab in the middle of it, and I was sitting on the couch watching TV. Standard faire. Obviously, you can see me from the window, but it's never been an issue until now.

My neighbor, a middle-aged woman who I've barely ever interacted with, knocks on my door, and when I answer it, she starts berating me that young children live in the neighborhood and that me not wearing a bra is perverted.

Apparently, she had been walking past my house and she saw me stand up to get a snack and noticed my boobs were ""flying free"" which makes no sense to me because I'm a B cup but okay.

I told her I'd do whatever I want in my own house but now I'm starting to feel like maybe that was wrong of me to do. I'm mostly weirded out that she was looking at me so hard that she noticed I'm not wearing a bra, lol. AITA?

I (18f) am the oldest out of 4 children who are all under too young to work. I have been working since the day I turned 16 and have saved around $25k. My bank account is connected to my parent‚Äôs because I was not 18 and able to have my own. So my parents pretty much has access to my entire life savings.

I told my parents my plan of selling my current car and using that money as payment for the new car and they started freaking out.

I tell them that there is no way they will be using my entire life savings to buy a house without even consulting me and that they‚Äôre basically stealing from me. 

They start yelling at me and calling me ungrateful and that the only reason I was able to save this much was because I lived under their roof and wasn‚Äôt obligated to really pay for anything.

I'm the third of four siblings and I had a pretty shitty relationship with my parents. Dad openly disliked me from day one because he believed that I was the result of an affair Mum had (she admits to the affair happening but denies the other guy is my father). Mum resented me because she blamed me for the problems that belief caused between her and Dad. Neither of them were particularly subtle about their disdain towards me and I very much felt excluded/like the black sheep of the family my entire childhood.

Things took a real nosedive when I was a teenager. Dad developed a drinking problem and he was a very verbally nasty drunk. I usually took the brunt of the emotional abuse he'd hurl out. On occasion he'd go for one of the other siblings and they could turn to Mum for comfort and they'd get it. When I went to her after he'd been shitty to me, she'd ask what I'd done to upset him, explain why I deserved it or just straight up ignore me. Dad officially disowned me as his son when I came out as gay at 16, and mum stood by him. I moved out on my 18th birthday and went as low contact as possible. Despite him being the one to disown me first, Dad didn't take kindly to being cut off and did his damndest to cause trouble for me afterwards. This includes, but is not limited to, him ruining one of my first real relationships by feeding my ex boyfriend malicious lies, causing so much drama at my former workplace that I got fired and showing up to my wedding reception 4 years ago, despite not being invited, causing a scene and ruining the day. Mum, again, stood by him and took his side through all of this. 

Dad died of pancreatic cancer two and a half years ago, and Mum died of diabetes-related complications earlier this year. I didn't shed any tears or go to either funeral because both of them made my life hell. Next week would've been their ruby wedding anniversary. My siblings are arranging a celebration in their honour and asked me to come. I said absolutely not. When prodded for an answer as to why, I said that I don't care that they're dead so why would I go to a memorial.

I told her about last year where I had pulled her out of the play because even though she got the part she wanted, she had to watch her brother(9M) and sister(10F) after scheduling issues. With the set times (3:15-6:00, I get off at 5:30:), she couldn‚Äôt look after her younger siblings. She told me they‚Äôre both turning 10 and 11, and they‚Äôre well past the age where they can start looking after themselves. Molly also pointed out she started looking after herself since she was 8 whenever I went to work (which is true).

I told her no. I said that she needs to stay home to look after them. Molly then started to argue. She asked why she has to look after them. Here‚Äôs the following conversation we had:

Molly: Why is it because I‚Äôm the oldest, I‚Äôm the one left with those two?! Mom, they‚Äôre 9 and 10, almost 10 and 11. I shouldn‚Äôt have to be looking after them anymore. They should be able to make a sandwich or something then behave around the house. I don‚Äôt want to miss ANOTHER school play because of that!!

Me: They‚Äôve already shown not to be responsible.

Molly: So teach them!! Make a checklist. Check in which them every half hour or something. They‚Äôre old enough, mom. I‚Äôm tired of being a babysitter. They sit around and watch TV anyway, so what‚Äôs the point of being home early?

I eventually just got angry with her and sent her to her room. Molly reluctantly obeyed. When my husband(36M) came home from work, I allowed her to come out, but she won‚Äôt. She‚Äôs locked herself in and doesn‚Äôt want to talk to anyone. My husband noticed she wasn‚Äôt greeting him at the door right away. When he asked, I told him what happened, and he took her side.

70,AITA for not allowing my daughter to go on an 8th grade school trip.,5166,Asshole,2090,hqshm2,1594719829.0,"This happened three years ago and my daughter ""Mallory"" still resents us for this.  I'm asking now because my son is going to be starting the eighth grade next school year, permitting that schools will reopen again and this event isn't cancelled.  

At my kid's school, there is a big annual spring break trip to New York City and Washington D.C.  It's something that most of the kids, including my own, were looking forward to.  When Mallory started the sixth grade, she talked about wanting to go on the trip.  We said she could, so long as she got good grades and didn't get into trouble.

When she was in the seventh grade, her aunt Linda got engaged and set her wedding date for the following year.  This was going to include a big family reunion with all the relatives because Linda was the last of my siblings to get married (big fat Catholic family), many of whom we haven't seen in years.  Unfortunately, Linda planned her wedding to take place the same week as Mallory's 8th grade spring break.  

We ended having to tell Mallory that she couldn't go on the trip afterall because everyone was going to be going to the wedding instead.  Like I said, this was going to include a family reunion, and it may be the last time we got to see some relatives including her great-grandparents for a long time.  

Mallory was heartbroken.  We offered to take a family trip to New York, but she turned it down because she wanted to go with friends and not family.  Understandable.  

Cut to the week of the wedding a year later.  We flew out to New Mexico for the ceremony and crash at my sister's (not the bride's) house.  Mallory is still upset about having to be in New Mexico when all of her friends are in New York.  A few days before the ceremony was to take place, Linda called off the wedding.  

Mallory was furious.  I can still remember her blow up.  She screamed, ""so I missed my trip for nothing?""  and stormed off into the room she was sharing with her cousins and wouldn't let anyone in.  

It was a mess afterward.  I tried to cheer Mallory up by offering to take her sight seeing or go see a movie with her cousins, but she refused.  I gave up after she refused to go to the movies with us, saying that she didn't want to watch a 'dumb kids movie with a bunch of babies' (while she is the oldest of the cousins, the next nearest cousin in age was nine at the time).  Mallory refused to speak to us during the flight back.  To this day, she's still angry at her aunt Linda.  

I know Mallory was upset, but no one could have predicted that the wedding would be called off.  We have tried to make it up to her, but she has refused every offer.  I know she wants a trip with her friends, but that New York trip is expensive and many of her friend's parents were not willing to spend more money on another outing for the girls.  

Because of this, Mallory thinks I am an asshole.  Am I?",False,False,2020-07-14 02:43:49

74,AITA for not forcing my child out of the house at 18?,4956,Not the A-hole,424,hpxe1q,1594600792.0,"My child's father and I have very different parenting philosophies. He very much believes that kids need to be out of the house at 18 and self supporting, and there is no ""relying on mom and dad"". I definitely don't have that idea. 

My family doesn't have any kind of ""you need to be out of my house by x age"" ideas. I didn't move out for the first time until I was 21, and I lived with my parents off and on after until I got my current place almost 20 years ago. It's not anything to do with gender and it's not a ""you can mooch off of us forever"" dynamic, the kids are expected to be working or in school, but it's not a huge deal for them to live with parents unless they're addicts, make really terrible decisions, or are just lazing around. My family doesn't produce many kids due to late marriage and low fertility, and family dynamics are just different when you know you're only having one kid versus families with potentially unlimited kids. 

My place is a 2 bedroom that is set up as a ""roommate"" situation.  Everyone told me I would quickly outgrow it and it would be inconvenient, but life only allowed me one pregnancy before my system gave out, so I never did. My child is doing well in school, is perfectly well behaved, and will be going to college in the fall, although online now. There's absolutely no reason I wouldn't let them live with me as an adult. They may not find it ideal, but there's no reason they would have to be homeless. 

My child's father remarried a woman with a child and had 3 more kids, bringing his total to 5 kids. He has a typical three bedroom. We have monthly family meetings, and at the most recent one, he brought it up, I guess trying to scare them, and starting talking all this crap about them ""finding their own place soon"" and ""life wouldn't always be this easy"".

He was enraged that I was ""undermining him"" and letting my child ""hide behind me and from adult life"". We left soon after.

My family is telling me that I should have been less blunt about it and just kept things on the downlow because I basically just said that their father was just a blowhard with no authority.

75,Aita for asking my sister to cover up around my husband?,4930,Not the A-hole,548,hqlht3,1594695817.0,"My sister (20) broke up with her boyfriend and can‚Äôt move into her new place until the first so she‚Äôs been staying with me (f22) and my husband (m23). 

She‚Äôs usually in something skimpy when she visits. I didn‚Äôt expect her to dress differently staying with us, but I also didn‚Äôt expect her to go from regular skimpy summer clothes to her bra and panties or short shorts and a bra. Still, it didn‚Äôt bother me because we grew up naked around each other all the time. 

Last night my husband asked me to talk to her. He said he isn‚Äôt comfortable with her walking around like that. I honestly don‚Äôt care why he isn‚Äôt, in my opinion, it‚Äôs his house and if he isn‚Äôt comfortable with it then it should stop. He said he‚Äôd just like her to throw a shirt on or some longer shorts, he‚Äôs not asking for her to completely dress like a nun. He also doesn‚Äôt care what she wears after he goes to bed, before he wakes up, or when he isn‚Äôt home. 

This morning I told her we‚Äôd like her to do that. I said while he‚Äôs at work she can wear whatever she wants but he isn‚Äôt comfortable seeing her wearing certain things. She completely lost it. She accused me of slut shaming her, being jealous of her body, and said it‚Äôs not her fault my husband is so attracted to her that he needs her to ‚Äúchange her life.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an issue of him being attracted to her, thinking she‚Äôs a slut, or me being jealous. I wouldn‚Äôt want to see his brother in his underwear either. And like I said before, IMO the reasoning doesn‚Äôt matter. 

She‚Äôs now currently stomping around and refusing to put clothes on. I‚Äôm ready to tell her to leave if she doesn‚Äôt like our guidelines. We‚Äôve already gotten into it about asking her not to smoke weed in the house and to be quiet after our daughter goes to bed. 

So am I the asshole for asking her to just cover up a bit?

Edit; so I did as most of you suggested and told her she needs to wear more or leave. She called my mom and my mom called me flipping out because my husband must be sick to look at a little girl/his wife‚Äôs sister and compared it to him seeing our 3 year old naked. She thinks I should try to accommodate her since her boyfriend dumped her and she was temporarily homeless. I told her to take my sister then and she was out early this morning.

She went from the most level-headed, kind person I know to a sick, manipulative junkie. She has a 4-year-old son who I have legal guardianship over after I called CPS bc I found opened, dirty needles on the floor of her house while her son (we will call him Adam) was crawling around. After all of that mess ended, she signed over her parental rights to me bc I was her only stable option. Adam has been in my care for 3 years. I took him in when he was a little over 1. The plan has always been for her to get her rights and Adam back when she gets clean. I told her I'd give her one year.

Now, I am a single mom who has a daughter a little older than Adam and they are absolutely inseparable. She 100% considers him her brother. And as for me, I \*never\* wanted another child... however, after almost 3 years I have come to love him like my own - and this is where the problem begins...

Obviously she did not get clean in that year, so I gave her another shot. Well, chance after chance, and now it's been around 3 years. Adam is becoming confused. He knows I'm not his mom, but he has barely seen his mom in a year. He calls me mom 90% of the time and the situation is messing with his head. (I have him in therapy with a child psychologist).

2 weeks ago was Adam's 4th bday. We did a small gathering - 4 family members and 2 friends. Adam's mom was invited as well - I just told her she HAD to be clean.

Well she came over with her shady ""bf""- a guy named ""AK"" and she was on so much dope she couldn't keep her eyes open. And when my mother asked her to leave, my friend went psycho and shoved my mom and cussed her out in front of Adam. We quickly had her removed.

That was my final straw, but here is the rub...

...I am also a heroin addict. For almost 5 years straight I was high EVERY single day that I wasn't in jail. I was awful. I lied, manipulated, cheated, and stole. I have been clean for 7 years - I only stopped using bc I got pregnant. Haven't even had a beer or a cigarette since. However, my recovery is why I am torn. She is BEGGING me for ""a little longer,"" but her son is seriously being damaged and I just want to adopt that sweet boy, who I consider my son- BUT as a reformed junkie, I am scared that as soon as I adopt him she will get clean. I would just feel awful if that happens.

The state and I are all set up for the adoption to happen (and have been for 2 years now).... I just need to know if I am being rash. She showed me so much compassion when I was on the streets and I want to do the same for her - but when I was a junkie, a \*child\* was not involved. I hope this doesn't come off as harsh. I don't judge her- I've been in her shoes. She has my empathy... but so does Adam. And I'm more concerned about \*him\*.

78,AITA for letting my parents pay for my girlfriend's tuition despite my girlfriend's parents being against it?,4477,Not the A-hole,339,hqk1uq,1594691368.0,"This is an alt account just for AITA uses.

Tl;dr: My parents want to pay my girlfriend's tuition after her parents disowned her for being gay.

Okay, let's start with some background info. My (21F) family is super liberal. Like hippy-esque liberal. My parents are super loving, and even if my two little brothers (twins 14) are sometimes quite embarrassed by our family, they are still cool with everything. I'm pretty sure this stems from my grandmas. My Nana on mom's side escaped her abusive husband and started to live with her black girlfriend (who I adore) in the early 60s. They raised my mom together and made her a liberal little shit if you so will, and my dad fell in love with her carefree attitude.

Now, my Nanas own a bigass piece of land with two beautiful cottages, and they let my family live rent free in one of them, while they live in the other. We only have to help them keep the property clean and sometimes shop for them. A non-issue, really.

My GF's (20) family is the polar opposite. They're conservative, homophobic douchebags. They don't know their daughter is gay, and if they did, they would disown her, kick her out, and stop helping her pay for college. That's what she told me, and that's what I gathered from the few calls I witnessed (we were roommates in college). All in all they're controlling and I don't like them.

Fast forward, Auntie Rona hit, and our college moved to online classes and closed the dormitories. My parents offered for my GF to stay with us during lockdown and she was happy to agree. But she had to ask her parents first and asked them if she could stay with a friend as I could help her learn for exams and the likes. It wasn't a complete lie.

So, my GF was allowed and we have been staying at my parents'. She's met my family and even my little brothers love her (she's into monster movies and they revel in watching this stuff with her). Now, somehow her parents found out about me being their daughter's girlfriend and they called. A lot of nasty things were thrown around and they threatened to come and get her. My parents intervened and cut the call short, shooing us out of the room, and they dealt with it.

Well, they did disown my GF, and won't help her pay her tuition anymore. She's devastated as she can't afford it on her own. So. My parents are really well off, so they offered to pay her tuition. She'd just have to keep her grades up and help out around the cottages and the property (which we already do). My GF was happy to accept. But she couldn't help it and rubbed it in her parents' faces. Now they're even madder and want to sue my parents (which, yeah).

My parents say it's not a big deal, but my GF feels super guilty as her family has been sending her nasty messages and telling her she is an asshole. So, reddit, are we the assholes?

One of my friends is really into art. Painting, drawing, animating, you name it. They have a cartoonish art style which is unique and beautiful. He uses a lot of symbolism to show people, which makes his art that much better.

Over quarantine, I decided I wanted to draw a picture of me and my friends. After two weeks and a couple pages filled with practice body parts (Hands, eyes, noses, you name it) I finished the picture and sent it to all of my friends. I went for a more realistic approach, trying to capture my friend‚Äôs actual appearances. I sent it out on out group chat, and nobody responded. 

Now, two days later, I get a text back from the art friend. It was an essay talking about how I like singing, they like art, and it was a douche move for me to try to one-up them, especially because they‚Äôve been drawing for years. 

I apologized, and said I didn‚Äôt mean to one-up them. They replied with 
‚ÄúYou literally traced art to draw a good picture, your entire goal was to one-up me.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt trace art, and I didn‚Äôt even look at references while I was drawing. (I would practice drawing the thing until I got the hang of it, and then I would draw it into the picture.), and there isn‚Äôt any art out there that looks exactly like my friends. However, all my friends seem upset and think I should‚Äôve written a song about my friends instead of ‚Äústealing his hobby.‚Äù

AITA?

Edit: I just found out what a reference is, and I did use one. I used a picture of my friends to draw the picture. I‚Äôm sorry for lying in my post about this, but it was unintentional as I thought a reference was tracing a skeleton and then drawing around it without it.

80,AITA? My sister wants me to adopt her baby but I want a different kid.,4403,Not the A-hole,592,hpfv6v,1594523900.0,"I know this is a little above this sub's paygrade but there's not many people I can talk to in real life so I'm turning to the internet.

My husband had shitty birth parents, so he and his siblings were removed and put into the adoption system. They tried to keep the siblings together, but at the time they were put in, my husband and his full brother were far older than their younger half siblings. The younger 2 (a baby and a toddler) were adopted almost immediately, then my husband was adopted at 10, and his older brother aged out at 18. The oldest 3 reunited, but they're still looking for the youngest.

My husband and I want to adopt. Ideally, we want to adopt siblings, so we can keep them together, and preferably older kids (10+) as we know it's harder for older kids to get adopted. Obviously it totally depends on the kids we meet and who we work with as a potential family, but we feel very strongly about adopting older siblings and keeping them together (so if we were to really click with older but unrelated children or found a set of siblings that included children younger than 10 we'd adapt that plan for them). The process takes a while, but we're nearly at the end of it. We've been approved as adoptive parents, and were matched with two siblings recently, but something happened with their birth family so the adoption was denied. We've been told that they'll re-match us very soon, but we've been waiting to hear back for a while now. There was meant to be an open day at a local home but it's been postponed due to current events.

Enter my youngest sister. She's 19, in university, and pregnant. She was going to terminate but couldn't bring herself to do it. She reached out to us, asking us to adopt her child. We're approved as adoptive parents, we have a decently sized house with more than enough room, she and the father would willingly allow us to adopt the baby, and it would be a very short process for us because we are basically good to go here. However, due to the reasons stated above, this isn't exactly what we had in mind in terms of adopting. We're open to changing that plan, but there's also the issue of my sister being the bio mum. She says she can handle watching me potentially raise her baby, but I can't see this not causing issues, and feel like if she's going to adopt out she should do it with a couple who aren't so close to home. We explained this and refused.

Since then various relative, none of whom can take the baby for various reasons, have contacted us asking why we can't take the baby. We've explained and re-explained everything but we're getting called selfish/mean/cruel for ""being picky"" because we are at a place in our lives where we can have a baby and we're turning it down. We thought about asking our friends who are also trying to adopt what they think but saying ""my sister offered me a baby but we don't want it"" would be pretty tone deaf when some of them have been waiting years for one, and that whole sentiment combined with my family's arguments has made us feel incredibly guilty, so we're turning to the internet.

Are we TA?

Info: we're in the UK, and my husband and I have both been in our current employments for over 2 years, meaning we both have full access to paternity/maternity leave ~~(up to a year of leave for me and 2 weeks for him (the system on that is honestly absurd but that's another rant for another time))~~ (turns out that whole bit is wrong and we'd be allowed to share our leave so ignore it), and we took adoptive parenting classes that included baby stuff so we are able to look after a baby, both in terms of competency and finances, but we do feel we'd prefer an older child (preferably child*ren*) and we don't know if having a baby could affect our current adoption attempts. We want multiple children, as we're both from big families, and a baby in the house could cause an issue as we're trying to adopt older children (eg they might think we just want a free babysitter).

&#x200B;

Update: I told my sister about our friends mentioned earlier, how they're a great couple who have been trying to adopt a baby for 5 years now, how they've fostered babies and taken all the classes and know what they're doing, how they live locally and are willing to have an open adoption, and again repeated that myself and my husband don't want to adopt a baby. My sister said that open adoption to a ""couple of strangers"" wouldn't work for her, and a couple hours later said that mum and dad are going to help her out, so it looks like the baby will live with them for the next few years and my sister and her boyfriend will take over when they can. Everyone now feels like I am somehow at fault for my parents not getting to enjoy the beginning of their retirement, but I no longer feel guilty as it's clear that was what my sister wanted all along - someone to raise the baby for a few years so she could step in as the mother whenever it suited her.",False,1594554092.0,2020-07-11 20:18:20

For this reason, I typically charge more than the average college babysitter would. Parents know that when they pay for me, they pay for a higher level of care, so price usually isn‚Äôt an issue. 

A few weeks ago, a mother with 4 kids (9F, 6M, 3M, 6 monthF), who was referred by a family friend, asked me to babysit from 8 AM to 10 PM on a Saturday. After corresponding with her for a bit, she told me she could only pay the rate I charge for two kids instead of four. Given that she was a friend of our good friend and I didn‚Äôt have any other jobs lined up, I said that was fine with the condition that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing housework. I generally do cook and clean when I babysit, but since she wasn‚Äôt paying full price, we came to that agreement. 

I arrived at her house and was immediately taken aback. Everything was a mess, her children were virtually uncontrollable, and she‚Äôd left a list of things for me to do, many of which involved serious cleaning. She rushed out of the house before I had a chance to talk with her, and left me with two of her children screaming without additional notes. 

It was a disaster. There was little to no food in the house, her elder two were extremely defiant and bawled when disciplined, the three-year-old wasn‚Äôt toilet trained, and the baby screamed when put down. I am generally good with clingy kids, defiant kids, and know how to help kids who aren‚Äôt toilet trained, but I have never had to deal with all three at once in such a cluttered house. More than once, I found exposed outlets, scissors and sharp objects left out, and otc medication laying around. Despite having agreed not to clean, it would have been a serious safety hazard to leave the house the way it was. At the end of the night, I made her aware of the difficulties before taking the money, reminding her we‚Äôd agreed I wouldn‚Äôt do housework, and saying I was concerned. She responded with the typical ‚ÄúOh, everything‚Äôs fine, I know we‚Äôre a little hectic, but so is everyone else, blah blah blah.‚Äù 

A week later, she asked me to come again, this time from 10 AM to midnight. After doing a little math, I told her I would not be returning to her house to babysit unless she paid me the full price for 4 children, and more if she wanted me to clean. She was clearly very upset, and kept begging me to lower the rate, but I told her it was unfair to have me do that much for what she was paying, and to find another sitter if she couldn‚Äôt pay. 

She then resorted to harassing me on social media and writing a scathing review on my babysitting page. A number of her friends joined in, saying I‚Äôm an AH who‚Äôs only in it for the money.

So I (18f) have a group of friends who are my only friends. I‚Äôll be naming the people in this situation Josh, Kayla, Anna, Emma and Cara. 

We were in grade 12 and had a class field trip to a university. When it was lunch time we all had money to buy food at their stands except for Josh. I am not friends with him but Cara is. No one had any spare money so I offered to get him something. I told him I could get him something and I asked what he wanted. He told me he was fine with whatever I was having (I haven‚Äôt said what I was going to get). So I went and got two boxes of sushi. When I went back to the table Josh looked at the sushi with a disgusted face. Then he said that raw fish was gross and that he thought that I would be getting burgers or something. I suppose my friends didn‚Äôt tell him that I was vegetarian (the type of vegetarian that does eats fish). I told him sorry that I didn‚Äôt mention that I was getting sushi, and that was the one who told me that he‚Äôll have what I‚Äôm having. He was mad and decided not to eat it, so I packed it up to bring it home. On the ride back he ranted to Cara about how inconsiderate I was and how I didn‚Äôt tell him that I was getting sushi. He said that I was the reason why he had a empty stomach the rest of the day and that he felt unwell since he didn‚Äôt have anything to eat for the whole day. 

Around 6 months later we were at my house and we‚Äôre going to get some take out. Emma wanted sushi and Josh brought up what happened at the university. That lead to a huge conversion and Kayla and Anna along with Cara agreed that I was an AH except for Emma who took my side. AITA?

Edit: I know the term is proper term is Pescatarian but I wrote vegetarian that eats fish thinking that it would be easier to understand and people won‚Äôt ask in the comments. My apologies, I will use the correct term next time.

Edit: Saw a comment about whether or not this is real since I put raw fish in my bag (lol totally understandable). It was around January and the locker rooms where we put our bags were pretty cold so the fish was fine there and the ride back on the bus was freezing.

Edit: I saw some people saying I‚Äôm the AH for not using the word pescatarian and that vegetarian that eats fish is inaccurate. When I referred to myself as a pescatarian most people ask me what it is. They told me that I should say that I‚Äôm a vegetarian that eats fish since it‚Äôs easier to understand. I would explain it to them but it does get annoying after a while when they forget all the time. They call me a vegetarian that eats fish because they forget the word pescatarian so I just go with it.

Edit: I don‚Äôt get why people are judging whether or not I‚Äôm an AH by me saying vegetarian that eats fish. I know that I‚Äôm a pescatarian and I use that term in public when I‚Äôm out eating but I say vegetarian that eats fish to my friends to make it easier for them since they can‚Äôt seem to remember what that word means. I AM NOT THE REASON WHY PEOPLE PUT FISH DISHES ON VEGETARIAN MENUES NOR AM I THE REASON WHY PEOPLE THINKS VEGETARIANS EAT FISH. Please don‚Äôt blame it all on me. I‚Äôve never been to a restaurant and told them that all vegetarians eat fish nor have I told anyone that all vegetarians eat fish. I only included that I‚Äôm a pescatarian in case someone might wonder why I choose sushi out of all the options. Their food stands had lots of meat options and some veggie options but I didn‚Äôt like the veggie options on their menu so I choose sushi.

Edit: I saw a whole thread about me saying that I‚Äôm vegetarian even though I‚Äôm pescatarian. I came here for judgement on my situation not for how I labeled my dietary restrictions. I was taught that there are 7 types of vegetarianism, Vegan, Lacto Vegetarian, Ovo Vegetarian, Lacto-ovo vegetarian, Pescatarian (Pescetarian), Pollotarian and Flexitarian.

My daughter is almost 4. She loves Barbies. My boyfriend's mom gave her literally 30 Barbies (she collected them from the 80's). There are some interesting ones like ""Coca-Cola"" Barbie and ""Toy R Us"" Barbie. And they're all different races/colors/ethnicities with different stories and backgrounds and themes. My child plays with them all and takes a different one to daycare everyday which is normally fine by them.

Until 2 days ago when my daughter brought one of the black Barbies. Things seemed fine until I picked her up. The daycare manager brought her out (usually it's her teacher that brings her to me), and asked me, in a ""whisper"" voice that they would appreciate it if my daughter didn't bring ""that"" Barbie back. I asked why, and was told it's insensitive to one of the kids there. I asked if the kids had an incident or something and she said no, nothing happened but they want to avoid insensitive issues during this time. I didn't ask anymore questions.

We left. I'm bewildered. I tell my boyfriend, he's both upset and speechless. We're both white and I guess we feel that it's not our place to say whether or not it's insensitive. Though we like to think it's perfectly fine.

I wasn't allowed anything ""black"" growing up, no black toys, shows, movies, even MTV was banned because it showcased hiphop. I didn't go to school with anyone who wasn't white until 7th grade. So, I thought we were doing something good with my daughter. She went to a diverse daycare prior to Covid, but switched to a (from what I can tell) predominantly white center. I don't ever want her to think ""non-white"" is bad or to be avoided in any way. 

So, there's a lot more that I can say but I think that sums it up. I want to raise her different than I was, but maybe it is inappropriate to have her bring a POC-Barbie to school. Again, as a white person, am I really able to make that call? AITA?",False,False,2020-07-11 19:55:15

If i pee too often she‚Äôll roll her eyes and tell my bfs sister ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not even that far along, shes being dramatic and peeing too much.‚Äù She‚Äôs has said a lot more stuff that I‚Äôm not comfortable repeating. She has also been trying to get my bfs cousins to dislike me. So now about half of his cousins think I‚Äôm a terrible person who is bullying Stacy (I don‚Äôt even talk to her anymore). I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable letting someone who is making me feel bad about being pregnant meet my son. I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs confusing, I‚Äôve never really talked about it to anyone. 

WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt let her come into the hospital room to meet my baby?

Edit: for those asking, I haven‚Äôt told my boyfriend because I‚Äôm scared of making the problem worse, but I think I‚Äôm going to talk to him about it today. I‚Äôm scared to tell his family because I have no family here, so I‚Äôm scared that they‚Äôll hate me if i say something.",False,1594844703.0,2020-07-15 11:59:35
86,AITA for banning SIL from my house for saying my baby looks nothing like my husband (and his race)?,4191,Not the A-hole,623,hp0w7u,1594457475.0,"New poster here. 

Some background: I (F31) been married for 3 years to husband (M37), we are a mixed race couple. Since before we got married SIL (F31) has been generally unpleasant - for example making snide comments about my job, which she finds v. dull, taking issue with me whenever she visits our home as I always request guests to take off their shoes, etc. Says it‚Äôs imposing and I‚Äôm treating people like they are dirty. Little things really but quite annoying as these comments keep on coming and we have to meet frequently - she is close to my husband, who dotes on her. I always just shrug off her remarks as feel like she‚Äôs just baiting me for an argument and succumbing to that would pretty much lower me to her level. I‚Äôve overheard her telling my husband that she thinks I‚Äôm fake cause I‚Äôm always smiling. 

 I recently gave birth via c-section. SIL visited shortly after my baby‚Äôs birth, took one look at her, then asked if I was sure if she was my husband‚Äôs since she looked ‚Äútoo chocolatey‚Äù , and maybe the real dad was black or brown (husband is white). SIL said this before all the other fam members from my husband‚Äôs side gathering around the baby. Husband laughed, everyone else fell silent, then she went on and on while she and husband bantered about daughter‚Äôs possible dad. I didn‚Äôt know what to say, just sort of stared at her in a shocked haze.

After everyone left, I told my husband he was an idiot to not realise SIL was insulting both him and me and she was being racist and I didn‚Äôt want to see her again - especially not while I was recovering from a hole in my belly and couldn‚Äôt even sit up without hurting. I cried and it physically hurt to cry. Husband says she was just joking and I am overreacting by a mile, that I don‚Äôt know her like he does and if I was so upset, why didn‚Äôt I say anything. I told my family, they were v pissed.

This felt like the last straw so I banned SIL from our house and from seeing our little girl indefinitely. Husband v. reluctantly delivered the news - I told him it was either that or I‚Äôd go stay with my sister with our baby. SIL reacted by crying and saying she didn‚Äôt mean to be racist or offensive but since I don‚Äôt believe her, I‚Äôve just ignored her. Husband is v. unhappy with me, says I forced him and won‚Äôt give SIL the opportunity to apologise, for something she didn‚Äôt even know she was doing wrong etc. but I really don‚Äôt want to see her. MIL also unhappy, said SIL has the right to see her niece, and being tired has made me unreasonable. Still standing my ground on this, but AITA?",False,False,2020-07-11 01:51:15
87,AITA for kicking out my brother with ASD right after he finished school?,3953,Not the A-hole,304,hr0ebz,1594757693.0,"
My (25F) brother (22M) recently graduated college. My parents were super proud and pushed him a lot, but in retrospect college is not for everyone and I felt it was a waste of time and resources. He is on the spectrum, but has the ability to function normally for the most part. He has a group of friends he games with, and 1-2 who he sees in person. And he‚Äôs capable of making good grades when he actually puts in effort. 

Around his junior year I told him that he could come live with me. My parents (dad in particular) have a hard time understanding him, and so I thought it would be a good idea for him to get away from that environment and live with me.

Fast forward to March. He‚Äôs graduating, but has zero work experience. I‚Äôve applied to jobs for him in the past, and the one that I got him, he was fired for due to constant tardies. He would go to work an hour or two hours late and say that they didn‚Äôt care. They did.

At this point, I‚Äôm extremely worried that I‚Äôm going to have to take care of him forever. And so this is where I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the asshole. 

I told him, in March, that he had until July to find a job. That I would continue paying rent and all utilities until then, but that if he did not have a job by then he would need to move out and go live at home again. May rolls around, still no job. I keep pushing him to apply, ask if he needs help, offered to look at his resume, etc. He finds a job in June at a warehouse. I tell him this is fine and that it can be temporary until he finds better employment. He worked for two weeks, then walked out one day because he felt it was ‚Äústupid‚Äù. I told him he needed to immediately pack his shit and move home.

I‚Äôm exhausted. He‚Äôs worked jobs in high school before with no issue, but recently he just refuses to work at all. And he always makes excuses for it; like that the people are stupid and stealing his ideas so then the job is stupid and he refuses to work it. I asked how he planned on paying his bills and he just shrugged. I can‚Äôt do this, I‚Äôm at my wits end and I truly don‚Äôt know how to handle him. I feel that he‚Äôs being super selfish and whenever I bring up the fact that if he is not working to pay his bills, then someone else has to do it, he just... says okay and walks off. My parents want him home because they feel he stresses me out and he‚Äôs their responsibility. But then when he‚Äôs home he stresses my mom out because he constantly insults her and makes her sad and I was trying to avoid this. 

TLDR: My brother on the spectrum refuses to work, so I kicked him out. AITA?",False,False,2020-07-14 13:14:53
88,AITA For refusing to take my ex wife along on our vacations?,3898,Not the A-hole,420,hpskml,1594580011.0,"Just to be clear, I am not planning to go on any vacations anytime soon at least until all of this is over with.

Me and my now ex wife got married straight out of highschool, both 18 and honestly really stupid. Same year she got pregnant and we had another child a year later.

Well as you can probably understand eventually we ended up divorcing, we turned in to very different people and we argued all the time, eventually she cheated and I filed for divorce 9 years ago. The kids are now 16 and 15 if that is deemed relevant, we got  split custody.

Our divorce pretty much made me realize what I was missing to be honest, I felt suffocated in our marriage. I got more confident, in shape and went back to college and now I work a great job and make roughly 4 to 5 times what I did when we were married. Of course this means I can take the kids on great vacations and spoil them a bit, the stuff we used to dream of being able to do 10 years ago.

After a few years of that my ex got jealous and started whining at the kids about not getting to go which has led to my daughter asking me to take my ex wife with us next time because she felt bad. I told her I understood, however she should not feel bad about it and that I won't be taking my ex wife with us as it would be weird at best as I would not like to have her along and I think my girlfriend would like it even less. A few months ago my ex called me herself to ask to come along as she wants vacations with the kids too. So I felt bad and told her if she wanted to she could take them on a vacation and I wouldn't that year. She shot that down and instead insisted on coming along and how she'd be in her own room and so on, I am a softy so again I relented, well turns out she told our daughter I agreed to take her along and pay for her and so on. So I called her again and clarified I was not paying for anything and I was only paying for me, my girlfriend and the kids if she wanted to come it would be at her own expense. Well she raged and got mad I would pay for my girlfriend and not my ex wife...I mean...What? So I told her this was a bad idea and she was hereby disinvited full stop.

So she posted about it on social media, whined about it to everyone who'd listen and now I am literally getting messages from my own mom and even some mutual friends about ""Treating the mother of my children badly.""

My boyfriend wanted to talk about our previous partners which is not something I'd be very interested to do but he didn't take no as an answer. He began listing all bad memories and character quirks and it was heavily biased. I only had 2 previous relationships and cannot really complain. My first relationship ended after Alex found out he was gay and we remained friends. With Patrick we were together for almost 3 years but I yearned to move abroad and he did not. We don't spend time together but it's not awkward when we meet accidently. Neither of them was abusive or had any huge, disturbing, negative trair I feel like I need to stress. They were respectiful during our time together and, futhermore, during our break-ups, too. I told something like that to my current boyfriend and he flipped out. The reason being me having any negative experience because apparently if we decided to break-up there must be something wrong. I tried to explain people do drift apart and sometimes it's better to just not force anything but then he began accusing me of still loving them (which in Alex's case would really be harsh for me). I don't feel any romantic attraction towards any of my exes but my boyfriend ignored that and repeated the same things over and over, probably hoping I'd confess my burried feelings of either hatred or love. I told him if anybody should be concerned it would be me, as  he wasn't able to say any positive thing about his relationships, which made me think what would he say about me - that I still loved my previous boyfriends? That got him to blow a gasket. He stormed out and didn't react to any of my calls, texts. When he finally did he pretended like nothing happend and upon me bringing it up again got his knickers in a twist again, blaming me for destroying his mood despite him being the one who'd brought it up, throwing a scene, ignoring me and seeing red after I tried to discuss it.",False,False,2020-07-09 19:01:05
90,AITA for making a rule about social media for my adult son and his girlfriend?,3794,Not the A-hole,296,hpbrun,1594509842.0,"I have a 20 year old son who I'll admit I have a strained relationship with, which makes it hard sometimes to enforce normal boundaries. He was staying with his mother and stepfather since his school shut down in March, but my ex threw them out and they needed a place to stay. He says it is because he hates her husband, but my ex said it's because his girlfriend is disrespectful, so it's probably somewhere in the middle.

I'm currently dating someone who is semi-famous. She did some child modeling, was on broadway for a little while, and is now having success in the music industry. She also has a massive social media following. My son seems to like her, though he is always bitching that she's too young for me, but I think he just doesn't like seeing me happy. I'm going to call my girlfriend Chloe and my son's girlfriend Riley.

Riley is driving Chloe insane. Every time Chloe tries to take pictures or do a livestream Riley tries to get involved. Chloe actually blocked Riley on all social media so she couldn't tag her and Riley confronted her, crying and saying Chloe is a narcissist who can't share the attention. Riley wants to be famous but she goes back in forth between what she wants to be famous for, which makes me think she's just fame hungry as opposed to Chloe who is a serious musician.

Well Chloe and Riley ended up in a huge fight the other day because Riley was trying to convince Chloe that they should do a duet (Chloe doesn't even make those decisions, she has a managed, but Riley isn't very smart) and Chloe pretty much told Riley to let it go and she isn't special. Well an hour later I was taking a picture of Chloe by the pool and Riley tried to get in the frame. Chloe just got pissed and stormed off, so I told Riley and my son that they are not allowed to take any pictures with or near Chloe and to stop trying to mooch off of her success.

91,AITA? We called the cops on a lady bc she refused to watch her autistic son at our pool.,3787,Not the A-hole,440,hqwozj,1594738381.0,"I (18f) am the manager at a pool, I have been the manager for 3 years (all the managers in this pool company are high school/college kids), everybody in the community knows and likes me. 

There is a lady named M and her son K; I‚Äôve known them for two years. K is nonverbal and he has autism. This means oftentimes when we tell him not to run and to exit the pool for safety break that he does not listen. That is okay with us! There are a lot of disabled children who come to our pool and we do our best to accommodate them, and his mother had been very cooperative with us until this year. 

This year, she started allowing allowing K to swim in the deep end unsupervised. She sits on the opposite side of the pool, not in the water at all, and her son is not in arms reach. At first I thought that maybe she could not swim but it turns out she doesn‚Äôt want to get her hair wet üòê. K is 4 years old  and a very small boy, and the deep end is 4 ft deep, which is just deep enough for a small child to struggle. 

When my pool opened this year, in the first week alone I had to jump in the water to save him twice because his mother was not watching him and he began to struggle. His mother insists that he is able to swim bc he is able to stay afloat on his own. While this is true, he does not have the endurance to stay afloat for long periods of time. When he gets tired he often grabs random strangers or things to stay afloat and rest- this indicates to me and my lifeguards that he should not be swimming alone, because both times that he drowned were times in which he got tired and did not have anything or anybody to grab onto. After both times that i rescued her son I spoke to M to discuss that she needed to supervise K to prevent this from happening again and she insisted that he can swim by himself. Obviously he can‚Äôt, as I have had to save him twice. 
I told my supervisor about this and the next time he visited my pool while M and K were swimming he told her she had to have her son within arms reach or that she had to leave. She neither left nor supervised her son so he called the cops on her. 

The cops escorted M out and all the residents and M made a huge stink about it on Facebook, they are saying that we are ableist and racist (M and K are black). First of all I don‚Äôt think I am ableist bc I have never had this kind of problem with any other parents at the pool, whether their child is or isn‚Äôt disabled they will watch their kids if they can‚Äôt swim because that is common sense. Second of all, I don‚Äôt know what is so ‚Äúracist‚Äù or ‚Äúableist‚Äù about wanting M to watch her son so that he stops drowning. It is so horrifying to watch a child swim knowing that if u take your eyes off of him that he might start to drown. 

AITA? I wanted to prevent her son from drowning again but not the neighborhood Facebook moms are mad about this and complaining to HOA.

Edit bc I‚Äôm getting a lot of questions about this: when you ask a patron to leave the pool and they say no then they are formally considered trespassing. We told M this and that if she stayed the cops would be called. She still did not leave so we called the cops to escort her off the premises. There was not really much else we could do bc we can‚Äôt physically force her off the premises, and letting her just stay instead of making her leave enables her negligent behavior.",False,1594747640.0,2020-07-14 07:53:01
92,AITA for not adopting my wife's child?,3837,Everyone Sucks,1173,hrd4rx,1594800347.0,"I (27M) used to have a wonderful relationship with the woman I love (26F). However, five years ago, she got drunk, had a one night stand, and got pregnant from it. Can't be mine, I can't have kids due to a horseback riding injury when I was a teen. Didnt get the guys name, no way to find him, so he's out of the picture. My wife decided to keep it, and we almost went through a divorce, but couples therapy made us decide to try again. We're still in therapy now, since I still have a hard time trusting her. 

So, she had her son. We talked a lot about it, and I made it clear that I'm ok taking on a step-parent role, but I wasnt willing to fully be his dad. I wouldnt adopt him, but I would help raise him and get him off to college. My wife agreed to this, became a stay at home mom so she could take care of him with help from her parents, and I've pretty much been the fun uncle like guy. I play with him, buy him games, try my best to not resent him (and I am in therapy for this), and mostly just stay out of the way of my wife's parenting. He even calles me ""Uncle,"" instead of dad. He knows I'm not his father, and is just happy to play video games with me and chill. 

Well, recently, my wife has started talking about me adopting him, something I'm not willing to do. I made it clear that if anything happened, he would go live with her parents, and I'd send child support. If they couldn't take him, I wouldnt put him in foster care or anything, but I also wasnt willing to take on the responsibility of being his father when I'm not. I'm happy being an Uncle to another man's kid, since thats what life threw at me. 

This has greatly upset her, and she's trying to find a way to force me into adopting him. She's even been manipulating the poor kid, saying he should start calling me dad instead of uncle like he has his entire life, which is upsetting and confusing the poor boy. This situation has worked for the last 5 years, and I dont know why she's trying to change something that isnt broken, or force me into a role I told her years ago I wasnt willing to accept, which she was fine with until just recently.

Update - after reading everything, I told my wife I was leaving and pursuing that divorce. I think I've been ready to do so for a while, but just needed the push. This has led to a complete melt down, but I stayed firm, packed everything up, and moved in with my brother across town. I have already contact the landlord to tell him I would pay for 2 more months rent. After that, everything needs to be switched to her. 

Talking to my lawyer, it was verified that, due to the process I went through after the birth to establish I wasnt the father, I would not have to pay child support or alimony, which is something very rare and uncommon anyway where I live. He's already working on the paperwork. No idea when it'll all happen, but once it does I'll cut full contact. 

My wife has tried to call and text multiple times, but I've refused to talk. I'll post another update when I know more.",False,1594840198.0,2020-07-15 01:05:47

I have been dating my boyfriend for almost three years, the whole time on BC. I basically get 3 packs at a time, take 9 weeks of pills consecutively, and then have my period. I have a little bit of room when it comes to scheduling my period.

My boyfriend and I got into a fight last night. I mentioned that I would be starting my period next Sunday so I could be done with it by Friday for my sister‚Äôs birthday trip. He 'joked', ""That's not an ideal time, could you have your period over the weekend \[we're away\] instead."" He has actually made this ""joke"" once before, which I shut down.

I said, ""I hope you're joking. Why would I want to be in pain while we're on a trip?"" He confirmed it was a joke, but said, ""It's like killing two birds with one stone. It's not like we're going to be having sex on the trip anyway.""

I told him that was a bad ‚Äújoke‚Äù and he agreed and apologized, but when I wanted to talk about how I felt, he snapped at me and said ""I already apologized and you knew it was a joke, so stop talking about it. You're beating a dead horse.""

He also said, ""Even if you started your period on Sunday, wouldn't you still be on your period until the next Sunday?"" I said, ""No, my period lasts 5 days"". He argued with me and said, ""No, periods last 7 days."" Now, I know that's true for some girls, but it's not for me. On BC, I have a light flow day, two heavy flow days, and two more spotting/light days.

At this point, I had really had it and went off on him saying, ""Don't try to tell me how long my own periods last when I'm the one taking the hormone pills, I'm the one that sees my blood, and I'm the one that's in pain. You don't have a period, so don't try to correct me."" He accused me of mansplaining periods to him, being mean, then said that I was being a bitch, and left the room. We woke up this morning and are still heavily arguing.

He wants me to apologize for being ""mean and unnecessary"" and says that I should have nicely corrected him. In my opinion, I had already corrected him once when he said periods are 7 days.

Since I refused to apologize, he also said that I clearly couldn't take responsibility for my own actions and am unable to understand how what I said would come off. But, he also said that he only called me a bitch because *I* was acting like one. He said he wouldn't apologize for calling me a bitch until I apologized for being mean.

I don't think what I said was mean at all, even if it wasn't exactly nice. Besides that, he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand what was wrong about his joke because he said this morning, ""You can schedule your periods and you'll be in pain either way, why not have it when it's most convenient for everyone. I was only giving my opinion on when you should have it, it's not like I was telling you."" Please tell me who is right. If I'm wrong, I'll apologize.",False,1594836280.0,2020-07-15 18:39:30

So I told them and most of them were like ""oh great, dessert is covered"". But we have a new colleague (Dina) who is allergic to gluten. I don't like Dina, Dina (I think) doesn't like me for some unknown reason, so we generally avoid each other, it's mutual. 

An hour later, Dina approached me and said ""I dont think I can have any of your brownies"". I said ""yes too bad"". ""Could you swap it for gluten free flour?"", I said no because the mild chewy texture of the brownie is something a lot of people like about it and that I really prefer my recipe to not be changed because it may not taste as good, that and I really don't like gluten free bread like foods. 

She said I was being unfair, so I told her another colleague is thinking about making another dessert that doesnt involve gluten and that maybe they should talk. She said okay but its just that pictures of my brownies looked amazing and that she really love chocolate. I just shrugged and left.

96,AITA for getting angry over having to use a different bathroom?,3495,Not the A-hole,359,ho2o6s,1594328495.0,"My family moved into a new house three months ago. It has two bathrooms. One bathroom connects to my siblings room, one is connected to the hallway. I have two brothers who share a room, and they mainly use that bathroom. My mom and I usually use the bathroom that‚Äôs connected to the hallway (Since my brothers have to share a room she figured it‚Äôd be more fair to give them the bigger room). I also have some physical issues and I use a wheelchair 99% of the time. I can stand and walk short distances with braces though. 

When my mom needs to use the bathroom she gets angry when I‚Äôm using the hallway bathroom. Last week she said that it‚Äôs hers now and I can still use it to shower but for anything else I have to use my brother‚Äôs bathroom. This has multiple problems for me. Mainly, their room is super cluttered and messy. I don‚Äôt go in there if I can avoid it. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to navigate in a wheelchair. Their bathroom also doesn‚Äôt have anything to make it more accessible. The hallway bathroom has grab bars which were installed when we moved in. 

I‚Äôve asked my mom why can‚Äôt she just use my brothers bathroom when I‚Äôm using the hallway one and she needs to go but she says she shouldn‚Äôt have to because she‚Äôs the adult. She also said I‚Äôm being overdramatic when I complained about how difficult it is to go through their room. I asked that she at least make my brothers keep their room clean if I have to use their bathroom. At first she did, but within just a few days she stopped and their room is messy again. 


Today was the last straw when I came through my brothers room and they had covered the majority of the room in a ‚Äòcastle fort‚Äô made of blankets suspended from their bed and different chairs. It‚Äôs easy enough for them to get around, but not for me. I asked them repeatedly to move the fort so I could get through but they refused. I ended up using the hallway bathroom and getting yelled at by my mom. I yelled back for a bit, basically telling her that if she wants me to use the other bathroom she‚Äôll have to start parenting my brothers so they stop leaving their shit everywhere. This, unsurprisingly, didn‚Äôt deescalate the argument, and she reiterated that I should suck it up and said I should force them to move their stuff. 

I honestly don‚Äôt think that it should be my job as a sibling to force my brothers to pick up after themselves just so that I can use the bathroom. I think it‚Äôs kinda weird that my mom would go out of her way to make the hallway bathroom accessible for me then bar me from using it because she‚Äôs annoyed that I use it.

Stepdad on the other hand acted like he was my ‚Äúreal dad.‚Äù He taught me to drive and play tennis, his parents acted like my ‚Äúreal grandparents.‚Äù 

My college graduation weekend was the same weekend as stepsisters. My dad went to hers instead. When I told him this upset me, he said he was sorry but that stepmom doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable driving to stepsisters college town alone, he had to be there for his wife. That really turned off any warmth I had for him. I love him because he‚Äôs my dad but I don‚Äôt like him, if that makes sense.

I am planning my wedding and I asked my stepdad if he would walk me down the aisle and give me away. He was so happy he cried. 

I let my dad know my wishes and he was really upset. He wanted to know why, I told him basically everything I typed here. He got angry and accused me of being petty and holding onto grudges. I told him he was just reinforcing my decision and he said I was robbing him of this fatherly experience. I told him he could walk stepsister down the aisle since they were so close but apparently that just upset him more and he claimed that they were not close and she would choose her bio dad. This really isn‚Äôt my problem though. 

I said this wasn‚Äôt up for debate and ended the call. Since then step mom and my aunt (dads sister) have been begging me to reconsider. They say I am being cruel. I honestly didn‚Äôt expect him to care so much.

I settled in and was just about to fall asleep when our dog let out a panicked howl. I knew my husband wouldn't hear it with his gaming headset on, so I go down in my underwear and a t-shirt to check things out. It's almost always a neighbor who gets home from work late and their car door spooks the dog for some reason. 

I get downstairs, and there is my MIL standing IN MY HOUSE!!! Her first words are ""I think we need to talk about your behavior."" Que explosion from me. Here is a brief summary of what I remember saying:

""What the #@$%?!?! Why are you here?! Why did you think it's ok to let yourself into our home without permission?! You need to get out now!!! You need to get outside now or I'm going to call the police!""

She stammers a bit, flustered at my outburst, and then runs out crying. I get my husband and he is PISSED. This is a hard boundary line crossed as both my husband and I are private people and this IS known to them. 

We get outside with masks on to try and calm down and get to the bottom of it all. We have an emotional talk about how their choices have impacted their ability to see their grandchild and it finally appears to have sunk in, even though we have explained this to them before. 

Whatever, we kinda patch things up and she apologises. It seems sincere but still seemed to lack the understanding of the severity of the offense since she then asked me for an APOLOGY for threatening to call the cops. No, I'm not sorry.

Lately I (29F) lost some weight, and I am slowly exchanging my wardrobe for better-fitting pieces. I work in a small office. For work I like to dress nicely and business appropriate. There is no specific dresscode, I just try to look good in my (new) day-to-day wear.

I have a colleague, Cheryl. She is in her 50s and we generally get along well. The annoying thing, however, is her habit of commenting on my wardrobe a lot, especially since I have started to change my style.
They're not necessarily unkind comments, sometimes it's just along the lines of ""Oh, cute dress! Where from?"" but sometimes her comments feel... backhanded? IE one day she looked at my striped shirt and said: ""Cute shirt, but only people with thin waists can pull off that pattern."" The other day she said about my scarf: ""I don't really like the color on you. You usually have such good taste.""

I have asked her in private to stop commenting because I feel scrutinized. She said she would, but soon enough it started again. I have tried to ignore it, but no avail. I have thanked her and smiled, but I found myself dreading going to work in the morning because I *knew* that she'd comment on something again.

Now where I might be the asshole. The other day I was watching a documentary about classical conditioning and behavior, and I came up with the idea that if Cheryl subconsciously linked her behavior to a negative ‚Äúexperience‚Äù/story, maybe she would then stop?

So the next morning, Cheryl made a comment about my black dress.

Cheryl:""All in black today? It makes you look so gloom."" Me: ""Yeah, I know. I bought this dress for my grandfather's funeral but I think I can also wear it for work.""

The next week I had on a new-ish pair of shoes. Cheryl: ""Ohhh, new shoes! You really have a lot of shoes!"" Me: ""Actually I bought them last year to cheer myself up after I had to put my cat down.""

The next time she made a comment on my shirt and that the color didn't suit me. I replied (not verbatim): ""Yeah my sister made it for me. I would not buy from [fast fashion retailer], not after that garment factory collapsed in Bangladesh some years ago. Over a 1000 people died!""

Ever since then I have told a sad story every time my wardrobe came up (think operations, break ups). None of these stories are made up btw, they're just not happy chit chat.

I feel that ever since I started my little experiment, her comments have died down. The other day though another co-worker told me that Cheryl complained about ""someone in the office being a downer and not being able to accept a genuine opinion."" Now I feel like an asshole and for not just sucking it up, because actually Cheryl has been very helpful ever since I started working there. It's just her comments that drive me up the wall.

100,AITA for telling my husband that he either gets rid of his consoles or he gets a job?,3451,Not the A-hole,500,ho8cqu,1594347939.0,"6 months ago I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Because I make more than my husband, we agreed that I would go back to work and that he would leave his job to become a stay at home parent. Currently my income and income from my investment portfolio are our only money sources. 

This arrangement seemed ideal at first, but my husband isn't stepping up as a stay at home dad. Basically after the first month she was born, he all but gave up. I would come home to a crying baby, a dirty home, no dinner, no shopping done, and my spouse sitting on the couch playing Final Fantasy. His defense was that the baby was in a crib a few feet away, so he was watching her. 

I've tried everything to fix this, we spoke to a counselor and tried setting a gaming schedule of about 10 hours a week, but he broke this almost immediately, saying that the therapist just didn't know how videogames work and that he can't ""just"" play an hour and a half a day. Again, he defends this by noting that he is keeping up with changing and feeding the baby, but that's honestly the bare minimum. He doesn't even clean the bottles!

Last night it all came to a head because I was opening the switch to play a game with a friend and saw that he had logged 80 hours in a game he just bought three weeks ago! I told him ""I love you, but this isn't sustainable. I feel like I'm working and providing just for you to stay at home and do nothing. If this doesn't change for good in the next month you're going back to work and we are getting a nanny."" He accused me of holding finances over his head, which I promised not to do when he stayed home. It would likely cost more to have a nanny than he would make, but at least I wouldn't have to worry so much and I could come home to a clean home. 

AITA reddit? I'm not expecting him to go full 50s housewife, but doing a load of laundry and dishes, cleaning the bottles, and picking stuff off the floor isn't a lot to ask. I end up doing a lot of cleaning and childcare when I come home and I work 50 hours a week.

101,AITA for asking my girlfriend [23F] to consider quitting a job that bothers me?,4165,Not the A-hole,931,hrobem,1594851270.0,"Before anyone gets upset, I am not insisting that she quit this job, and if she chooses not to, that is her prerogative. I just asked her to consider doing so.

My girlfriend, Ana, is currently a law student, her second degree after qualifying in a language degree. During the summer, she works for a family friend named David. She calls her job a personal assistant, but it seems much broader than that - she is his translator and interpreter, she goes to events with business partners as his ""date"" or ""partner"", and when clients visit David at home or go to dinner with him, she entertains their wives and makes drinks or entertains or cooks, etc. When David hosts events, Ana runs them, wrangling guests and arranging seating plans and so on. In essence, it often appears she is a kind of ""hired wife"". I have never encountered a job of this kind before. David is mid-30s and unmarried. Ana has alluded to him hiring escorts when they are abroad. I have never met him, but this made me feel very uneasy.

For the whole summer, she is with him - there is a room in his London house she calls her study with a sofa she sleeps on, and they regularly travel abroad together. **I never see her during this time**, she claims to work from 7am to 11pm six days a week and says David does not like her to use her phone during work hours. She also said David does not like her to eat during work hours either but he counts her going to the gym as a valid use of work hours. On top of this are ""business expenses"", such as David buying her clothes. **Even when she is at university**, she is frequently getting phone calls from him at all hours of the night, which she says is due to the time difference.

Two nights ago, we had a big fight over this job. I told her she looked like she had lost a lot of weight and she just brushed it off and said she had a stressful job. I said it seemed like a very weird set of duties, and she got defensive it had started out as a more normal job but that she had taken on more duties as David had started to depend on her. How much can he depend on her when she's still at university for a third of the year? She let slip during this conversation David was funding her law degree and paying her a stipend **even when she was not working**, and I told her that I found the whole arrangement to be very suspicious, asking if she was sure it wasn't something sketchy or that she wasn't being exploited in some way, not saying in what way.  I told her she might want to reconsider a job which basically turned her into a non-sexual escort and that I was uncomfortable with the whole thing.

She shut me down and told me that I was being a controlling AH and that her job was her own, and that even suggesting she consider what a weird occupation she had was a massive dick move on my part. But me, I genuinely feel like I'm going crazy anytime I try to explain her job to others... and even when I think about it myself.

**FAQ:**

1. I have known her for five years, dating for three. We live together while studying with four other roommates. She has had this job since before we started dating, and David was always her quirky boss that she would have anecdotes about. 
2. David knows her family and is close to her older cousins, from what she has mentioned it. Ana and David are both Russian. His family is much wealthier than hers, if I understand correctly. Her family know she has this job, and think it is great.
3. She includes this work on her CV. She is on the books to some degree, as she gets her weekly salary into her account and bonuses in cash, from what I understand. The clothes she gets are nice but not flashy, just normal work clothes like blouses and pants or neat dresses. I do not know if they are designer. She has the occasional very nice cocktail dress from an event that she either sells for extra cash or keeps for other events. I do not know if it is from a high-end label. 
4. There is a possibility, mentioned elsewhere, that she may be misrepresenting the eating rules due to her history of disordered eating. This is something I intend to discuss with her.
5. You can stop telling me she's likely having sex with David. There are 800+ comments here saying something similar, and it isn't particularly relevant to the discussion. 

**Mini-update:** we spoke briefly on the phone this morning before she started work. She apologised for flipping out, saying that she was stressed and unwell. I said I wanted to bring her and David out for lunch to clear up this misunderstanding and apologise for being controlling. She went off the phone to speak to someone and came back on and said David wanted to have me for dinner, presumably not in the Hannibal sense. She said she would get back to me by the end of the day with a day and time that works, so if she doesn't, well, I don't know.

102,AITA for not wanting to support my girlfriend?,3363,Not the A-hole,474,hooohp,1594415472.0,"(Posting on behalf of a friend who doesn't have a reddit account, what follows is her words translated to English, not mine)

I (f28) have been dating my girlfriend (f27) for two years and have been living with her for the last year.

While we both hate our jobs, mine is more stable than hers and I make about 35% more than her. Because of that, when we first moved together we agreed that I would pay a larger share of rent, utilities and groceries. I also often treat her when go out to have dinner or to the cinema. It was an arrangement we both were happy with, and I was glad that I could help her out.

Yesterday she told me she was seriously considering quitting her job. I told her that it wasn't the best time for such a move, but that if she really hated her job so much of course I'd be happy to support her while she found a new job. It turned out that that's not what she meant.

She wants to quit working entirely and become a full-time homemaker. 

We had sometimes joked about that, but I had no idea she was serious. I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with that. If we only had one salary, we'd go from living comfortably (if frugally) to having to make a major change in our lifestyle. I'd have to worry about how to pay our bills, which used to really stress me out.

She got very upset. She said she felt I wasn't taking her feelings seriously. I know that she hates her job, but I also hate mine. She's seen me crying in bed after a bad day, or losing sleep over whether I'll be fired. Quite frankly, it felt like she was saying that her own emotions were more important than mine.

Eventually, she called me cheap and said that I should tap into my savings account to help her. It's true I have some money in that saving account, but I had been hoping that it would one day become the down payment to a flat we could live in together. 

I've never been able to make her understand why it's important to me to have an egg nest. She's not very good with money herself. She's the type of person who will spend all her money on clothes or games and then will ""borrow"" money from her parents or me which she never pays back. She never saves a penny. I used to think that it wouldn't matter. I could be the responsible one, we could keep our finances separate, and that way if she ever was in an emergency I could help her out. But if she's going to insist on quitting her job I'm worried she'll use my money irresponsibly and we'll be in financial trouble. 

During our argument, I ended up admitting to that, and she got were upset. She said as her partner it was my duty to support her and that if I wasn't willing to merge our finances then I mustn't be very serious about relationship. But I am! That's why I wanted us to be able to buy a flat together eventually!

Today we've both been avoiding the topic, but I can tell she's very upset. AITA?",False,False,2020-07-10 14:11:12

When both our kids got engaged, we gave them a choice. We would pay for a small wedding and give money towards a house. Or we would pay for them to have a big wedding and nice honeymoon. 

My daughter Sara got married at 20 to her high school sweetheart. They took us up on the small wedding offered and were happily married for 8 years before our son-in-law passed away. 

After his passing, she announced that she was bisexual and that she was now dating a women named Laura.

I told her that the deal was a one time offer, and that we are done paying for weddings. 

She got very angry and accused my husband and I of being homophobic. She said if she was marrying another man, then we would happily pay for the wedding.

This is not the case at all. And if our son were to remarry, we would tell him the same thing. We paid virtually the same amount for both of them to get started out and feel that we have done our part to be fair.

The earliest she can get the kids into daycare is a week after when they want her to start and they asked me to watch the children for a week. With their commutes it would be about nine hours a day of childcare.

I probably would have done it for my other son but watching these children comes with so many rules. They are vegetarian and on a strict diet and last time I watched them food was not provided. DIL is very strict about language. The tv isn‚Äôt allowed to be on (I don‚Äôt even watch tv but I had to put that in there because I found it so rude) she wants the four year old to do some enrichment worksheets that I would be expected to do.

105,AITA for saying I won't put in more money for my to be step-son's college fund?,3269,Not the A-hole,591,hr7jvn,1594781956.0,"Background story: I have one daughter 13f, Anna. Her mom/my wife passed away three years ago. I am now engaged to Jade. Jade has a son 15m, Ben. 

We got engaged few weeks ago and finally got around to talking about merging finances. Anna has a pretty good college fund (we call it that, but it's basically hers to use however she sees fit). 

Jade has also set up a college fund for Ben. But Anna's is about 10 times as much as Ben. Jade suggested that we split the fund equally and I absolutely refused. My reasons were:

1. My wife worked full time and I stepped down to freelancing when we had Anna. My wife earned a lot and we had a policy of putting 30% of our salaries into the fund. Needless to say, my wife's contribution was much more than mine. 

2. My wife's parents contributed significantly to this when Anna was born. 

3. Money from my late wife's life insurance went into this fund directly. 

Jade didn't like it but she understood. I have started working full time too now that Anna has grown up. Jade works full time too. I told that I am currently putting 30 percent of my salary into Anna's fund which after marriage I will make 15% into each for Anna and Ben. 

Here is where it gets tricky. Jade thinks it's not fair that Anna's fund gets the same amount as Ben's as hers is already big enough. She thinks I should put 30% into Ben's fund until it reaches the same amount as Anna's. 

When I argued that it was unfair, she was telling me there is a difference between equality and equity. She was telling how Anna was lucky that she had two parents who earned well and grandparents who helped. Jade could only do so much as a single mom with no one to help. She had to waste lot of money on childcare and rent while me/my late wife had a house and each other. And then she showed me this picture: https://images.app.goo.gl/tr3v5DfpeXrfvWRB8 to explain how Ben needs help more than Anna. 

I get it. Ben will be going to college sooner than Anna and Anna definitely has a lot of money. 

I still don't think it's fair to ask me to stop contributing to Anna's fund. Jade did the best she could under the circumstances she was in and I am proud of her for that. But Anna shouldn't be punished because Jade was in a shitty situation. 

Jade thinks that it's just going to build up resentment between them in the end. 

So, AITA?

Edit: Because i was told to add this.. Jade is not contributing to Anna's fund now. She will be putting in money for Anna once Ben is in college.

One of my friends is getting married this winter. Out of all my friends, she‚Äôs one of the ones I considered to be the closest to me. However, she has a ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù who‚Äôs also a bridesmaid in this wedding, and I cannot stand her. We‚Äôll call my bride friend Ashley and her best friend Kristen.

Kristen treats Ashley terribly, and is a generally unpleasant and miserable person to be around. She has some personal issues that make her hate herself, her life, and everyone around her. I‚Äôve never liked her, but I‚Äôve hung out with her in group settings where Ashley has invited us all out, and I‚Äôve been very kind and friendly to her in those situations.

Recently, my husband bought himself a new car, and I shared that on an IG story. Immediately after, Kristen blocked me on all social media. I found this to be weird and out of nowhere, because we had not had any issues with eachother, are in a bridal party together, and Ashley‚Äôs 3 day bachelorette weekend is coming up soon. I asked Ashley why Kristen blocked me, and she told me that Kristen is struggling financially right now, so she found it inconsiderate and flashy of me to post that my husband bought a car. Weird, but okay. This girl clearly has some issues of her own, and she was never MY friend to begin with. However, when I talked to Ashley about how I felt weird about this, she told me that she totally agrees with Kristen, and that as a matter of fact, it upsets her whenever I share anything she considers ‚Äúflashy‚Äù on social media because it ‚Äúmakes her feel like shit‚Äù. Ex: My husband‚Äôs new car, my outfits, our house, etc. Things that I like and have always shared on my social media, because it‚Äôs my life, and that‚Äôs what social media is for. She told me that her and Kristen screenshot my social media posts and send them to eachother to complain about me. When I expressed that this made me uncomfortable, she replied with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm entitled to my feelings.

He has little in the way of a support system, and so my parents--both medical professionals--felt moved by his story and decided to help him as much as they could.

This week, he came to stay with us for a few days while my dad takes him to visit a renowned ophthalmologist in our area. The first evening, I sat with him and we chatted for a long while--the first time in a decade or so. I could tell that we held very different political values, but I didn't think it would come up too much since we were talking about our lives.

At one point, he mentioned getting run over by a car. I was shocked, and asked him more about what happened. He then went on to explain that he lives in a ""gay hotspot"" with many bars and clubs, and that he was walking alone at night when a ""transsexual drag queen"" hit him as he was crossing the street, and then proceeded to drive off. I asked if he had pressed charges for the hit-and-run, but he said that he knew he would be treated as the villain because he was a straight, white man.

This story was so bizarre and traumatic that I didn't know what to say, if anything. As his friend, I felt angry and sad that he had to suffer like this. But as a queer person with many trans friends, I was incredibly hurt and confused. I decided not to say anything, and the conversation went on. He started to talk about his girlfriend, and eventually we landed on the topic of marriage.

My friend starts talking about how marriage has turned into ""a circus,"" and how it is no longer sacred. By this time, my parents had joined the conversation, and they mercifully attempt to steer the topic elsewhere, with limited success. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore, and had to choose between speaking up or walking away. I spoke up.

I told him that I felt really uncomfortable and that his comments about gay people were very upsetting. I told him that he was wrong to assume that everyone in the room shares his views. And I pointed out that the sexual orientation and gender identity of the driver who hit him had nothing to do with their crime, and that it was a weird and inappropriate detail to point out. He responded that he didn't realize I wasn't straight because I had mentioned my boyfriend, and then changed the topic.

Also, if he could have seen the rainbow fannypack I had on, he might have made a different assumption about my sexuality...

108,AITA for saying that I‚Äôm (30F) not going to let my husband (34M) pick the name of our third child?,3061,Not the A-hole,374,hq5f83,1594629209.0,"We found out the first baby was a boy & my husband was adamant that we had to name the baby after him. He told me how important it was to him to have a son named after him. I wanted to compromise & find a name we both liked, but my husband wouldn‚Äôt budge. So I agreed to name our son after my husband, even though I didn‚Äôt like the idea, with the promise that I could choose the name of our next child. Unfortunately, I went into preterm labour (they don‚Äôt know why) at 26 weeks. Our son was born 3.5 months early & he lived for 2 weeks before he caught an infection that was too much for him & he died.

The second pregnancy turned out to be a girl, so I came up with a list for my husband to choose from. He stated that we were naming her ‚ÄúSamantha‚Äù (not her real name), so I reminded him that he promised me I could pick the name. I told him I didn‚Äôt really like the name Samantha, but He insisted that he had always loved the name & he really wanted to name our daughter that. So we spent the entire pregnancy arguing over name selections, every name I suggested he shot down. I said we could make Samantha her middle name, but he told me that it didn‚Äôt matter what her first name was, he was going to call her Samantha. So eventually, I gave in & we named our daughter Samantha. I made him promise I could pick our next child‚Äôs name because he really didn‚Äôt give me any say with our last two & it really upset me.

Fast forward to today, I‚Äôm pregnant again with another boy. My husband said how important it was that he had a son named after him, and that he wants to name our son after his middle name ‚ÄúBrian‚Äù. This time I‚Äôm not giving in. I told him he had a son named after him & I‚Äôm sorry that he died, but this time I‚Äôm picking. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that he‚Äôs picked the last two baby names. My husband said I was being mean & purposefully not trying to see things from his perspective. I told him that since he gets to pick the middle name, he can make Brian our son‚Äôs middle name. 

He‚Äôs again saying that it doesn‚Äôt matter what I decide, he‚Äôll call our son Brian anyway. I got mad & yelled that I have been more than fair in the past, even naming our daughter a name I didn‚Äôt even like just to make him happy. Not once did he ever consider any suggestions I gave him, so this time he‚Äôs just going to have to live with whatever name I choose because that‚Äôs final, & I stormed out. I genuinely feel bad that he feels he was cheated out of having a son named after him when our first died, but there‚Äôs nothing I can do to change that... he‚Äôs not the only one who lost a baby, I still struggle with that too. 

So, AITA for this? Should I reconsider given what happened to our first? Is it really that important for fathers to have sons named after them? Am I missing something?",False,False,2020-07-13 01:33:29

 Well, whenever is go to the fridge to get water, my(18) dad(50) would kind of give me a dirty look, a few times when I forgot to fill the pitcher and he got on me about it. I made sure that didn't happen again and that there was always water there. 

Then, a few weeks ago, my mom came to me and told me that he was complaining that I was drinking too much water and that he noticed an increase in our bill. I laughed and thought she was messing with me but she was dead serious. I couldn't believe he made a deal over me DRINKING WATER.

Fast forward 25 years later. We have kids that are 21 & 23. My daughter (23) made a comment about getting life insurance through her job, so I decided to check on our policy. I hadn‚Äôt in years. Well, when I did I was surprised to see we had never changed our secondary beneficiaries. They were still my husband‚Äôs nephews. We totally forgot to change them. I thought it was a little funny, my husband did too. Obviously we‚Äôre alive and fine. We called the company, started the process to have it changed.

My son thought it was funny, my daughter didn‚Äôt. She said ‚Äúwe were irresponsible‚Äù and didn‚Äôt think of them. What if we had died? What if the nephews didn‚Äôt give it up?

My sister hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since then and I honestly feel like she‚Äôs dragging this out. All because I wasn‚Äôt on her side during the separation.


So what happened was she attended a work event with her husband. It was a party and everyone brought their spouses. She was  pregnant so she wasn‚Äôt drinking. Her husband got pretty drunk and she saw him and another coworker flirt, her exact words were ‚ÄúHis hands were on her waist and her hands were on his lower thighs‚Äù. They were dancing really close and whispering to each other smiling. My sister got upset and left the party in tears. 


She went home and and packed her bags and called me asking if she could stay with me and wife for a few weeks as she gathered herself together as she was planning to divorce her husband. I told her to calm down and she told me the full story and I told her that she‚Äôs overreacting and pregnancy hormones are why she‚Äôs pissed.

114,AITA for refusing to let my sister come wedding dress shopping?,2759,Not the A-hole,172,hpzwh3,1594609378.0,"This actually happened a couple of years ago, but my mom drags it up from time to time because she never really agreed with my decision.

Me (30F) and my sister (27F) never got along as kids. She has always been intentionally antagonistic towards me. When I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 16, she went out of her way to make nasty comments just to see if she could upset me. Being the younger sibling, my parents mostly took her side whenever we would argue (which was a lot). For example, when she would take things that belonged to me without asking and break them, my parents never made her apologize or replace the things. If she made nasty comments towards me, my parents assumed it was because I must have provoked her, same thing if she ever bit or kicked me (which she did well into her teens). If she didn‚Äôt get her way, she‚Äôd throw a temper tantrum (she still does this, even at 27). Once she started screaming and crying in the middle of the street while we were on vacation because we were going to Versailles and she wanted to go back to the hotel and watch TV (she was 15 at the time). Needless to say we‚Äôre not close. We barely speak to each other and once my parents are gone, we‚Äôll probably just cut contact all together.

Fast forward to a couple of years ago. I Had got engaged and was sorting out the logistics of going wedding dress shopping (which I was paying for) and decided that I just wanted my mom and my future MIL to come with me. The plan was to go to one appointment, go out for lunch, and then go to a second appointment. I don‚Äôt generally like being the center of attention so I just wanted to keep it really small and simple. When I told my mom this plan she started yelling and crying over the phone because I wasn‚Äôt including my sister (she had already gotten upset when I said that I wasn‚Äôt going to ask her to be in my wedding party). She told me that if I didn‚Äôt invite my sister to come dress shopping then she wasn‚Äôt going to go either and hung up.

I was upset, because I had been looking forward to going dress shopping with my mom for years. Once I had calmed down a bit, I wrote her an email detailing exactly why I didn‚Äôt want my sister to come. She was awful to me growing up and if she decided that she‚Äôd had enough of dress shopping or didn‚Äôt like the place where we decided to eat, etc., it would have been entirely possible that she would throw a public temper tantrum and ruin the day for me. Ultimately I said that I wanted it to be just the two moms and if my mom didn‚Äôt want to come because I wasn‚Äôt inviting my sister, that was her choice.

Eventually she decided to come even without my sister being invited, but she makes it known periodically that she‚Äôs still bitter about my decision to not include my sister. My then-fianc√©e, now-wife, was 100% on my side, but my mom seems to think I was the asshole in this situation.

We don't live together (we're only 18) so I don't always see her when she is having a bad period. Sometimes her periods get very painful. When I am around her when this happens, she gets very grumpy. But this time was worse.

Her mom was away from home for a couple days and she was having a very painful period. She asked me to come over to her house to take care of her and that she didn't want to be alone. I went over. She was pretty rude that evening/night. Some things she did were not that bad but they add up.

-She never said please or thank you no matter what even when she had me go out to buy ice cream at midnight or after I made her a dinner or whenever I would bring her something.

-She asked me to bring her something to her while she was in the bath. When I did I told her she looked really beautiful. She said ""How the fuck does that help me"".

-She said the dinner I made "" tasted shitty"". Not saying she has to like it but still. She still decided to eat it.

-She asked me to come keep her company while she was in the bath as she was lonely. I started talking to her and she said ""shut up"". She wanted quiet and no talking (which is fine). She just wanted me to hold her hand.

-She asked me to cuddle her in bed so I did. When she let out a moan in pain I told her ""I'm sorry that sounded painful, everything will be ok"" and she said ""Don't downplay my pain if you don't have a vagina"".

-She asked me to eat her out because she was horny and thought an orgasm would help with the pain. When I was done I asked her for a handjob and she said "" Ew no. I'm the one being taken care of here."". Not saying she had to but she didn't have to say ew. She then said she should have just used her fingers so she wouldn't have to deal with my horniness and that it would have felt better anyway.

-She said multiple times her mom does a way better job at taking care of her.

-She asked me to play a song on my phone. I couldn't find the song because I heard her say the song name wrong. She let out a big sigh and said ""Moron"".

-She rolled her eyes at me multiple times.

-When I was pouring her dog some food she told her dog "" You're lucky he didn't make the food himself""

-Every night whether we are together or apart we have always told each other good night and I love you. When she said she is going to sleep I said "" Good night I love you"" and she said ""I'm trying to sleep.""

In the morning I told her I didn't like how she was treating me and that it hurt my feelings. She said I have to deal with her and take care of her while she is on her period. She said I was making her pain about me. The period was still bad that day and she wanted me to take care of her again. I went home saying I won't take care of her again unless she apologizes and treats me better. She now says I left her all alone in pain and I'm being a bad boyfriend.",False,False,2020-07-13 07:55:28

This is a hot-button issue for me because I was the third boy in my family. It's an open secret that my parents had me hoping for a girl. My parents loved me, took good care of me, and gave me a good life but every time I think about them feeling disappointed when I was born another boy it really hurts my feelings if I'm being honest.

So when I consider that we are flipping a coin on our hypothetical 3rd child I can't stand the thought that my wife would be disappointed if it turns out to be a girl. I would like a third kid, but in my opinion we shouldn't have one because we specifically want a son. I asked my wife ""OK, what if we have another girl?"" She answered ""Then we should try one last time. If we have another girl so be it; we are a family of daughters.""  I just think her attitude is wrong and only want to have another kid with her if she doesn't care about the gender.  But maybe I'm being unfair due to personal bias. AITA?

Edit: thanks to everyone who posted. A lot to think about. It's possible that I've made too much out of things, but if we do end up having a boy I may have to watch out for her spoiling him, as some have suggested. Adoption is a good suggestion, too.

My friend wanted to go with me and she did for a couple of sessions but now her husband is at home in the evenings and obviously wants to spend time with him.

The thing is, she wants me to switch to Saturday morning classes instead. I don't want to because I like to have a lie in on Saturday mornings and also I've made friends with some of the other people in the weekdays and I look forward to seeing them. The weekday classes are a lot smaller so it feels more intimate and the instructor struggles less to show us stuff on Zoom.

I told my friend that I was going to stick to weekday classes and she got upset with me because this was something we were supposed to do together. I pointed out that she was the one that made the change but she doesn't see why it's such a big deal for me to wake up on Saturday. But I have a Friday night Dungeons and Dragons campaign that doesn't finish until 3am so I don't get up until 12pm. But my friend says I would still get 6 hours of sleep. I don't only want 6 hours on Saturday though.

She's now making veiled remarks on my Work In Progress pics I post on my social media because she doesn't want to to do the Saturday morning sessions by herself. But if I can make friends and play D&D with strangers then surely she can too if she really wanted to.

Incredible show with a talented and diverse cast.

Anyway back to present. Our extended family have done lockdown together, as my parents own a large property so there‚Äôs room for me, my boyfriend, sister, my parents, my brother and his wife, plus our 3 dogs. 

At dinner the other night we were talking about our current (terrible) political climate. This whole thing started with me saying I couldn‚Äôt believe that we are a country that went from electing Obama to trump? Like we were so progressive in voting the first black man president so how could we even then go from that to trump?

My SIL is a trump supporter and voted for him. She was a surprise supporter and even my brother was surprised she voted for him. Though she voted more as a joke than anything else (sigh)

When I made that comment SIL immediately told me I had no idea what I was talking about! That Obama wasn‚Äôt the first black man to be president.

At this point the entire tables attention was on my SIL, all in awe as to what explanation she was going to pull out of her ass. Would be quite the magic trick.

My SIL with the metaphorical mic begins to explain that Obama wasn‚Äôt the first black president, but Thomas Jefferson was. As she‚Äôs met with blank stares, she continues her idiocy. SIL says that actually in fact there were a lot of high profile black men in politics ‚Äúback in the day‚Äù 

Needing even more info than that, we asked her where on Earth she was getting this information?

She then tells us, much to my delight and defeat, that ‚ÄòHamilton‚Äô was very educational and had taught her a lot.

Again another brick wall was hit and again we needed another explanation. She obliged and told us that before watching the show she had no idea Thomas Jefferson was black.

Barking out the biggest laugh ever I even spat out my water. This fool thought Thomas Jefferson was black because he was portrayed by a black actor (Daveed Diggs) in that show she saw that one time. History be damned this whole time she thought certain historical figures were black because of who portrayed them on Broadway.

Unable to contain myself I just said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such an idiot, a huge fucking moron, it‚Äôs unreal‚Äù

The whole table erupted in a mix of laughter and shocked gasps. For the record I‚Äôd never really got on with my SIL but have never spoken like that to her before. Still I was in disbelief.

SIL then went onto say she didn‚Äôt think it was right for black actors to portray white characters/people because it was confusing.

My brother is furious at me for disrespecting his wife but I just think he‚Äôs embarrassed. Anyway AITA?

TL:DR Called my SIL a fucking moron because she thought Thomas Jefferson was a black man, because he was portrayed by one in Hamilton.

120,"AITA for ""letting"" a friend and his ex GF get incorrect tattoos in my language?",2707,Not the A-hole,460,hreqza,1594806659.0,"I was born and raised in Ireland. While Irish Gaelic is sadly dying out, my grandparents spoke it fluently and taught it to my mother, so I, along with my brother, was raised bilingual and can speak both English and Irish. I moved to England about 2 years ago now.

There's a guy who I'm friendly with, but he has this thing about Ireland. He's one of those people who's like ""I know I seem English as they come but my mother's cousin's piano teacher's dog was an Irish setter so I'm part Irish"", he talks about wanting to go to Ireland all the time and he has asked me to teach him Irish to ""connect with *our* culture"". I'm trying to be both vague and specific at the same time to give me some deniability but also communicate what kind of person I'm dealing with here.

He's been seeing this girl for about a year and a half. She's in the same boat as him, both in terms of heritage and fondness for Ireland, and she's also talked about wanting to learn the language. Around 6 months ago they asked me to translate the word ""soulmate"" into Irish.

Here's the issue with that: there is no word for soulmate. There's a word for soul, and a word for mate, and if you put them together it makes ""anam cara"", but that basically means ""soul friend"", and isn't generally considered a romantic thing (and technically speaking it's not even grammatically correct and should be the other way round but this is the popular approximation of it). I did explain but he said that I was probably mistaken, because the concept of soulmates is universal. I went ""well then anam cara it is, then"" because I wasn't about to argue with him over the literal translation of a vague abstract concept in a language only I spoke. If he thought he was right, then why waste the energy correcting him (this isn't the first or last time I've had to take this approach with him).

6 or so months later, they've broken up. And my friend has messaged me asking if there's any variations on the phrase ""anam cara"". I asked why. He said that when they asked me for a translation of ""soulmate"" it was because they wanted to get matching tattoos for their first anniversary.

I then pretty much said that as anam cara is closer to meaning ""best mate"" than ""soulmate"", he can just apply it to a good friend of his. He then had a fit. Basically said he couldn't believe I'd let him get an incorrect tattoo, said he'd have to get a full cover-up now, and that I didn't even try correcting him. I responded that if I'd known this was a tattoo then I'd have done more but added that he's not the most... receptive to correction (my exact phrasing was ""have you tried correcting you?"").

My wife did not enjoy being a mother, but in my opinion she was a pretty great one. She did everything she had to and went above and beyond to make sure our kids got to do activities and have fun childhood memories. She went to therapy for years to try to learn to like being a mother and then to learn to cope with the regret of having children. One therapist told her being a mother was kind of like soccer (she played one season as a kid and hated it) it's just an activity that a lot of people like, but my wife will never be able to force herself to like it. She did need a lot of breaks, time with friends, time with just me, but I know she tried.

My 21 year old daughter has been clashing with her mother since she turned 12. I really think she just enjoys antagonizing her. My kids definitely both view me as their piggy bank and I don't mind. I'm happy that I'm in a position to give them things. My daughter frequently makes comments about what sort of woman has kids and doesn't want them. The only reason my kids have even an inkling of how their mother felt is because she used to lock herself in the bathroom and cry. They have never been told she did not want them and what annoys me the most is my daughter wants to be a therapist. She should have more sympathy for someone who got so overwhelmed she had to go and cry in the bathroom.

I've asked my daughter why she brings it up and if it hurts her. She said she just thinks it's funny, but it really upsets my wife. I told my daughter if she keeps antagonizing her mother for no reason I'm going to cut her out of my will.",False,False,2020-07-09 16:09:17

I also am very particular about my notes and I write down most of what my teacher says. Some teachers don't offer powerpoint/word slides during class where they write down whats important so in these classes we solely depend on our notes.

I started university last year and I met ""Elle""(20F) who was my first real university friend. We shared a couple of classes and also hung out outside of university. After a while Elle started hanging out with some of the ""popular kids"" and she started ignoring me. At first she swichted places during class so she can sit with her new friends, we stopped hanging out because Elle was ""too busy"", at some point she unfollowed me on social media and even during classes she wouldn't talk to me.

The only times she would talk to/text me was when she needed something from me, like homework answers or notes. 

Back in january we had our literature exam (literature was one of the classes we shared). I passed but 50% of the class, including Elle, failed. They were supposed to re-take the exam in march but 'rona happened so now they will take the exam in two weeks since universities are slowly opening up again. 

Whenever people ask me if I can send them my notes or generally need help with a subject I always help or send them my notes. This is also what happened a week ago. One of my classmates who is really nice asked me to send her some of my notes as she really stressed and she thinks she lost some of her notes, so I sent her the notes she asked for.

Yesterday the same classmate texted me again, apparently a lot of people from our literature class are struggling with their preparation for the exam. My classmate told me she recieved a text from one if her friends(also in our lit class) and Elle asking her to send them my notes.

I told my classmate that I'm fine with her sending my notes to her friends (who is also really nice) but I'm not comfortable with her sending my notes to Elle. I think my classmate told Elle she won't recieve any notes from me because today I checked that Elle has blocked me on whatsapp and social media.

Here's the problem. If Elle fails this exam again she'll get kicked out of university. I think my notes could make a difference because I know that Elle didn't takw thourough notes in the first place.

I told my friends about what happened they are very split. Some say that I'm right and i shouldn't let Elle use me but some of my friends were shocked because they said that I should be a good sport and let Elle have my notes so she won't get thrown out of uni. I'm feeling so conflicted right now.

Sorry if my words are a little jumbled, I‚Äôm kind of freaking out about this at the moment (throwaway because I don‚Äôt know if any of my aunt‚Äôs friends use reddit) 


I‚Äôm currently out of work because of restrictions (server in a town that only allows take-out/delivery right now), and I‚Äôve been taking on odd jobs. I‚Äôm in an okay position, so I‚Äôm just trying to get a little extra for just in case. My aunt knows this, and she (bless her heart) decided to try to help me. I thought she meant looking in her town‚Äôs job ads or asking around at her work, so you all can probably guess why I was extremely confused when I got home from camping to a ton of emails from aunt‚Äôs friends and relatives about baby blankets.


For background: I‚Äôve been crocheting and knitting since I was a little girl, and when aunt‚Äôs two children were born I made them both baby blankets as baby shower gifts. These blankets were about 4ft x 5ft (enough to last through childhood, if necessary), complex with lots of colors (single-crochet graphgans), and they easily took me around 30 hours of work each. 


Back to the problem. I read through the messages, and it seems my aunt was promising them a custom baby blanket done in 2-3 weeks for $50. There is no possible way I could work that fast or charge that little (materials cost between $35-$75 depending on the yarn), so I emailed all the women back apologizing for the mix-up and letting them know I wouldn‚Äôt be able to complete their orders as promised by aunt. I did tell them I would be willing to make the blankets, but for around $120+ depending on size/materials/difficulty/etc, and within 5-8 weeks with a waiting list. On the bright side, two were completely understanding, the other six... not so much. One said that she was devastated because her grandma was supposed to make her baby a blanket, but had recently died and she was so excited when aunt said I could make her one like her grandma‚Äôs in time for her baby shower (3 weeks away), and I feel so bad about getting her hopes up like that


Aunt now is angry at me because apparently everyone is mad at her too, and she was ‚Äújust trying to help me out‚Äù. She thinks I‚Äôm being ungrateful, and I should have just done it because blankets aren‚Äôt very difficult to make, and to save face. She also thinks $120 is too much to ask (‚Äúthere are much cheaper ones on Etsy‚Äù), and she‚Äôs worried about how this whole thing might affect some of her friends with postpartum depression (that worries me too). I‚Äôm so pissed at her for this, but I understand why she did it and I know she was just trying to help me out, but ughhh, I feel terrible, and like a total jerk because of how many people are hurt and upset.

These cards were found at my in laws as they collect all kinds of randomness, and my brother in law has been cleaning stuff out for them. He asked his parents if they could regift them to my son, since he‚Äôs 10 and plays Pok√©mon with his siblings and pals. They say ‚ÄúYes, sure, we were gonna throw them away anyway.‚Äù

So they give him the gift and he is over the moon. Like OVER THE MOON, Best birthday ever, kind of joy. 

As he was given this gift my other sister in law, starts making a big deal about there being thousands of dollars in valuable cards just given to a ten year old. She was just over the top about how much $$$ could be there. Annoying but whatever. She knows nothing, just speculation. 

We blew it off, took them home and let him play with them as they were intended. We said we weren‚Äôt gonna try to value them, just let him enjoy them. Which, he did! He plays for hours with his older sisters for 3 days, makes all kinds of decks. They all have a blast. 

Then... I get a text from my in-laws demanding such a ‚Äúvaluable‚Äù gift back. They think there is thousands of dollars there thanks to my sis in law. 

And....My kids are pissed, man. Offended they asked for them back. They‚Äôre kids stuck inside during a pandemic with rad Pok√©mon cards, being asked to return them after they were given as a gift. 

My 13 year old (his older sister) sends a well written but salty message saying just that: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre mad! How can you ask for a gift back?! We were PLAYING with them!‚Äù Told them they were greedy and wrong for asking for them back. 

My in laws lose their damn minds and say that the kids are disrespectful and we‚Äôre bad parents for letting them keep the cards. Say we ruined the family relationship by not giving them back. 

So we let our kids keep half of them and give the rest back in an effort to keep peace. Be the bigger person kind of thing.

I've recently started dating this guy - Andy for about six months. His best friends are Felicity and Jacob and they've all been friends for over ten years. Andy and Felicity are very close - and I mean very close. They go to one another for everything, they meet up two days of the week and they text 24/7. At first, I tried to not think anything of it as I knew they were friends but I didn't realize they were that close. I've questioned it before - thinking that surely there was something between them prior. He laughed and said that nothing has ever happened between them, that Felicity and Jacob were always a thing. He also said that they went through a lot of things during high school and that she was his person during really rocky periods in his life and they're each other's support systems. I'll be honest, their closeness does make me feel uncomfortable and I feel that it often interrupts our relationship.

Fast forward to now, Andy is the best man so he's often busy helping with wedding planning, etc. One night I was invited to drinks and I was then made aware that Andy offered to walk Felicity down the aisle, confused I asked why wasn't her father walking her down. Felicity said that he passed away and that originally her cousin was walking her down but he lived interstate and was unable to travel due to borders being shut.

When we got home I asked Andy why didn't he tell me or even ask if I was okay with it. He replied that he didn't have the time to tell me as it was arranged literally moments before we went out to drinks and he asked why wouldn't I have been okay with it. I told him that I was slightly uncomfortable by the closeness of their relationship and I often felt he prioritized their friendship over our relationship. That the last couple of weeks I felt that I wasn't given as much attention as Felicity had been receiving and I didn't really understand why he was the one to be walking her down the aisle. 

He said that he was very close to her dad and that Felicity is a very important person in his life and she shaped him to be the person he is today and that she's done so much for him that he wanted to do this for her. He said that I shouldn't feel uncomfortable and that he hadn't meant to make me feel that way. He stated that their friendship was important just as much as our relationship. I got angry by this as I felt he wasn't understanding my perspective at all, I said that he clearly thinks I'm of less importance compared to her and that he wasn't taking my feelings into consideration. I told him I was uncomfortable by it and out of respect for me, he should at least just stick to being the best man and perhaps find someone else to do the job.

Jim always wanted kids. At least 2.

I always imagined myself being a mother, too, eventually. When I met Jim, I didn't really have a maternal instinct, but I assumed this would come.

As I approached 30, Jim brought up the subject of kids more, as he said if we wanted several, we shouldn't wait too long. I still wasn't feeling very motherly. But everyone told me it would come. I loved Jim & our life together. So we married when I was 29.  I gave birth to our son Evan at 31.

Pregnancy was difficult, and I was feeling sick all the time, but I thought there would be a reward at then end.

There is no way to sugarcoat it: I love my son, but I hate being a parent.

I feel like I have no life at all. I can't do anything I enjoy. I don't recharge from anything. It feels like there's only work and being a mother.

I used to be an artist, abut my wage could not support a baby, and we also bought a house, so I was forced to take a higher-paying office job, which I hate.

Jim knew I was having an awful time. To his credit he did a LOT around the house and he's a great father. But even with his help it seems like a never-ending pit.

I've been to a therapist, but I don't think this is post partum depression. Not anymore. I think i just genuinely do not like being a parent, and I feel like I can't tell anyone.

Evan is now 3 and started kindergarten this September. It felt like such a relief. It doesn't really change much about my free hours, but it felt like such a milestone. A relief. I also love that I can now already have conversations with my son, albeit simple ones.

Corona was  awful for me. I did home office and Evan was home from kindergarten. I couldn't deal with having to focus on work & also having a 3-year old at home.I feel like this was just the final blow for me.

I decided I never want another child again.

Jim had already mentioned a few times that he would like to have our second soon, as I'm 34 by now, and as he doesn't want the age difference between our two to be too large.

First I cited the virus as being a bad time, but in my heart I knew there would never be a good time.

He mentioned it again the other week. I was just so tired an fed up, that I broke down and said I hated having to take care of a baby and I never want to do it again.

He got very upset. He brought up that he was always trying to be supportive (which he was) and that he had always told me he wanted kids, at least two, if not more (also true).

We argued a bit, going back and forth.

He then asked me ""Are you sure, or just upset now?""

I said: ""I'm upset but also sure"".

He said then then he'd really need to think about what he wants to do.

We haven't really talked much since. We've been polite to each other, but mostly just functional conversation.

I went downstairs and found her purse but it was a little cluttered so I put it in her wallet in her purse so it would be easy to find and count. 

When I opened her wallet to put it inside, I couldn‚Äôt help but see her ID in the transparent front pocket, and it had her photo but her name was completely different from the one she had given us and we‚Äôd background checked when we had hired her. 

She‚Äôs been great, so I didn‚Äôt want to just fire her, but this meant she was either using a fake name with us or carrying a fake ID, so we had to see if she was trying to hide something relevant. She‚Äôs someone who spends prolonged time alone with our kids. And as great as she seems to us, our kids can‚Äôt really talk yet. So we can only know so much. 

My wife and I discussed it and decided to hire a private investigator to check into her, because whatever story she gave us if we confronted her, we‚Äôd then take steps to verify it anyways. So it was best not to give her the opportunity to hide anything or backtrack. 

The PI discovered she had the ID to circumvent a bureaucratic rule about student living arrangements for the graduate school at her university (something like she wanted to stay on the undergraduate campus when she became a graduate student so used an undergrad friend‚Äôs name on her ID to register for housing.)

Then, unfortunately, unbeknownst to us our 3yo overheard us talking about it and said something that tipped her off to the whole thing. We explained that we had become aware, looked into it, but it was all fine now. 

She was *very* upset, said it was none of our business why she would have two IDs, and it was a violation of her privacy to look into her life instead of just asking her. Now she‚Äôs even considering quitting. 

We feel awful, but are also weighing that with how awful we‚Äôd feel if we didn‚Äôt do due diligence and there was something serious to it. We‚Äôre conflicted now, because she has always been wonderful. AITA for hiring the private investigator?

I was recently diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma stage 3b, and day before yesterday I shaved my head in preparation for chemo. I‚Äôm very very sick, and I can‚Äôt handle bathing myself properly every day, so I went ahead and shaved my head early for practical reasons. 


I fucking hate it. I look like a racist skinhead, or like a concentration camp victim. I do not look like a cancer patient, I look disgusting. I don‚Äôt want to see myself in the mirror, but it‚Äôs not like I spend a lot of time looking at the top of my head so I figured it would be okay. 


Then, suddenly, my brother and my best friend, who both live with me, had my husband shave them bald out of solidarity. I get it, they‚Äôre trying to make me feel less like a freak, they‚Äôre showing me I‚Äôm not alone, etc, etc. The problem is, it feels nefarious. I did specifically ask them not to do that. So the fact that they did anyway makes me feel like my suffering is being minimized, like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bald too it‚Äôs not that bad.‚Äù And I have to see their ugly bald heads everywhere I go, reminding me that I, too, have an ugly bald head. 


I haven‚Äôt broached the subject with either of them yet, I don‚Äôt even know if my feelings are justified so I don‚Äôt want to rock the boat if I‚Äôm just being a dick because I‚Äôm sick and grouchy. I just don‚Äôt want to be reminded of being bald and having cancer every time I look around, it‚Äôs driving me fucking crazy. I don‚Äôt want to talk to or see either of them.

Edit: you guys are right, both groups are justified. My brother and best friend are incredibly caring and I‚Äôm sure they didn‚Äôt do it to hurt me. Perhaps my request NOT to wasn‚Äôt very clear, or as one redditor suggested, maybe they thought I was saying no out of self hatred but that I would still appreciate the solidarity. Either way, they‚Äôre trying to be supportive and I should appreciate that, but it‚Äôs okay for me to be upset about the ugly bald reminders.

134,AITA for adopting a child i used to teach who has mental health issues?,2249,Not the A-hole,188,hp48m1,1594471986.0,"UPDATED to add a couple things because there's just too many of the same kinds of questions to respond to all of you individually sorry!

Re her mental health issues: her main thing is a lack of trust with other people and a form of confrontation avoidance, which was leading to her either shutting down and not responding to people or running away. Prior to being here she was in several big foster families(6+kids) and i think the constant noise and fuss was detrimental. However my boys have been taught from early on the fussing or throwing fits wont get them anything so this tends to be a very quiet and relaxed household and I think this helps her feel less threatened. She is not violent towards others or herself, she just does a form of dissociation, although this has been improving a lot since she has been going to a therapist regularly. Amelia does cone across as a very mature child, probably largely because of what's she has bedn through. 

Biology at the school I teach at isn't real biology. Its basically just a program where kids from poor or underprivileged families can get to experience things that kids in more middle class families take for granted like trips to the zoo or estuaries. We have pet days where we bring in police dogs and therapy animals and talk about the differences between species etc. Its not like we're doing dissection or sex ed, and I see it as a cool opportunity for kids to learn about animals in a fun hands on way. 

It was important to me that my ex was ok with it as he is still in my boys lives 25% of the time and they adore their dad so i didn't want to make any decisions that could lead to ex and i having to go back through the courts. I have spoken to him again this morning and explained that Amelia is in a good place here and she deserves just as much love as our boys and that its not like I'm planning on giving anyone special attention. They are all treated the same. 

Therapy for my boys: during the divorce both boys saw a child therapist for the year around the divorce. Their lives haven't changed a lot because their dad has been travelling a lot for work for the last 10 years. The only thing that really changed is that when their dad is off work he lives about 2 blocks away, instead of at home. My ex did live in the apartment my sister now lives in for about 6 months after the divorce whole the boys got used to things changing. 

My eldest is currently seeing a therapist once a fortnight(sought out by him not us) because he has been bullied a bit at his school, I was very proud that he recognized that he needed help to deal with the emotions he was experiencing and sought it out rather than internalize it.

-End of update




I (36f) met Amelia(currently 9f) about 3 years ago when i was teaching her biology class. She was an excellent student when she applied herself but was frequently late/a no show. Through other teachers I found out that her parents had issues with drugs and her father was in prison. Last year Amelia stopped coming to school and i found out that her mother had died under some suspect circumstances and Amelia had been put in foster care. I was upset but unfortunately its not an uncommon experience teaching at a poorer public school. 

I have 2 sons with my ex husband, they are 12 and 14. Both great boys who are doing well despite their father and i splitting up about 2 years ago. I have majority custody because their father travels a lot for work. Their father and I get along fine and usually agree on most things. 

For the last 4 years I've been fostering children. Usually older kids who are likely to age out of the system, im considered a great home because i have other children, experience teaching and my older sister(who has a PhD in psychology) lives in the apartment below us, as well as a comfortable income, I own my home outright and have a decent amount of money set aside for emergencies/holidays/therapy. 

About a year ago i started thinking about having another child. My boys are less reliant on me now. I had been looking both at a sperm donor and adopting when I was contacted about a young girl needing a foster home. I wasnt told much except that she had been running away from foster homes and had some trauma. Of course I was happy to try and help and the girl turned out to be amelia. 

She has been living with us for the last 9 months or so and has been improving drastically with weekly therapy. Both my boys like her and my sister(childless by choice) adores her. I have recently expressed an interest in adopting her. I've had support from everyone in my life except my ex who thinks it would be irresponsible to keep a child with mental health issues around our boys long-term. From speaking to the boys they don't really care and enjoy having a younger sister. WIBTA in this situation?",False,1594505242.0,2020-07-11 05:53:06
135,AITA for showering during the day?,2213,Not the A-hole,444,hoa7t5,1594353884.0,"AITA for showering during the day?

Throwaway because my regular account is the username I use for everything, obligatory I'm on mobile, character limit, etc. 

First, to give you a little background. I (F29) moved into my new place just prior to you know what. I rent the upper level of a home with my husband (M33) and we absolutely love it here. To give you an idea of the layout, it's an old house in a very old New England town, our home is very close to the neighbors. A small alleyway separates our houses, maybe 8 feet wide at most. There are a lot of windows in each house, and these windows face each other mostly at eye level. I have not met my neighbors due to current world events. Anyway, onto the story:

Everyday I have a routine. I wake up early, work out for a couple of hours, then take a shower. Today after getting out of the shower, my neighbor surprised me by ringing our doorbell. She's a mother of two (M8 and M14) and came by to inform me she caught them spying on me while I was in the shower. We have an opaque window cling covering the bottom portion of the bathroom window that was here when we moved in. My husband and I didn't worry about the top half because again we live on the upper level, someone would have to be in an attic staring down into the window to see anything, and the top half gets steamy anyway. Well, her sons have apparently been doing just that... going up into the attic to look down into our bathroom while I shower. She said has caught them doing this several times since we moved in. I was horrified and thanked her for telling me, and asked her how she planned to discuss this with her sons. 

Wrong move, she. Blew. UP. Let me be clear, I don't parade around my house naked. I don't press my breasts against the window and shake 'em around while I shower, I just exist like a normal person within my home. I genuinely did not realize I could be seen. She started berating me for corrupting her sons, and insisted I begin showering at night with the light off to ensure they would no longer be 'tempted' by me. I was in shock and told her I would absolutely not be doing that, it's a safety hazard and besides it doesn't address the real problem- her young boys being peeping Toms. 

She was screaming at me on the porch at this point and I told her to get away from me before closing my door on her. I'm infuriated she's making me out to be some kind of predator, when it was my privacy that was violated. I ordered a window cling for the top half that should arrive in a couple of days but I'm still humiliated and angry. I have absolutely no plans of waiting all day covered in sweat after exercising to shower at night in the pitch dark. My husband is pissed at the neighbor, but my sister (who also has a young son) agreed with her and kind of tore into me. She said if I had kids I would understand. I'm genuinely conflicted. I don't want to rearrange my entire day for these little pervs. Am I the asshole for this?


EDIT: When he got home from work my husband and I sat and read all of these comments, thank you everyone for your input. A lot of you made some very good points I hadn't really been thinking about with regards to the boys behavior. To answer a couple of questions:

1. To be more clear, the window is 3ft tall by 1 foot wide. We have a tub with a showerhead, the window is built into the outside wall of the building shared with the shower, if that makes sense. So yes you are standing in front of a window while you shower. The uncovered top half of the window begins just below my collarbones; if the neighbors' window was eye level, the boys would only be able to see my face and head. However they are going upstairs and looking down into the shower from above; I hope this paints a clearer picture. 

2. We had only met the previous tenants during the walkthrough, a man and a woman in their 20s. I have no idea if the boys watched them, but after speaking to both my landlord and the downstairs neighbor about it, as far as they know the previous tenants had no problems with this neighbor. Both downstairs and our landlord confirmed they have not had previous issues with this neighbor either. They are a wealthy family that owns the home. 

3. While I can appreciate cynicism, I feel many of the people messaging and commenting as though I am playing dumb for karma because how could I possibly think I'm the asshole? Did not read through. I don't necessarily think I'm an asshole for the act of showering in general; I was debating on whether I was an asshole for not thinking the window cling through and showering in the daylight without it. After speaking to my sister on the phone and arguing, she made me feel like an asshole as she acted like it is common sense to have covered the whole window as soon as we moved in. I really never thought of that, neither did my husband. It was like this when we moved in so we assumed it was OK. I also worry my question, though not intended to be rude, was an overstep to my neighbor as a parent due to her reaction. I was fully going into this expecting a torrential downpour of YTAs (hence using a throwaway rather than be traced back to my real name and face). Sorry about the title, I was still pissed when I wrote this, it is what it is. But you can read the post. 

For now we have taped up a garbage bag in the window as many of you suggested. The window cling I ordered should be here Monday. I don't know if I want to contact the police. We just moved here and don't want to cause trouble. My landlord has known these people for years and is friendly with them, she offered to talk to the mother ONLY if the mother reached out to them to complain about the situation. If not, we're going to leave it be for now and hope that's the end of it. 

PS my husband and I both cackled at all the comments calling my sister an idiot; we've butted heads in the past and I love her to death but she is quite bossy, holier than thou... I almost want to send her the link just so she can see another perspective.

She was not hurt however, because if that were the case I would have known and I did not know about it til she told me.


I gave her teacher a call and she conformed that it was true. According to the teacher daughter she was trying to sneak upstairs during break time and was caught by a school prefect. She tried to run but lost her balance and fell down a flight of stairs. 


The prefect went to a teacher who found my daughter crying at the bottom of the stairs. She was taken to the school nurse and was found to be completely fine, not hurt in any way. The teachers then decided that it wasn't an issue and this incident went as if it never happened. 


I was livid. The fact that my child fell down a FLIGHT OF STAIRS, which could normally end up VERY BADLY, was hidden from me just because she was miraculously unhurt? I don't know, this sounds wrong in so many ways. I should have the right to know if anything happened to my child in school out of the ordinary.


I posted this incident on social media while demanding an explanation from the school. I was told by the school  that they hope that I could put it down because I am giving my daugher unnecessary attention. At the end of the day she was not hurt and I should just move on like she did.

2 days ago was my birthday (just turned 17!) and it was honestly the best birthday party I ever had. I invited many people (including my family & adopted brother).

When it was picture time, we took a group picture and I later asked if I could have a family picture too (just the family). My family agreed and my mother wanted to call my brother to come as he was talking to his friends. I told her to not bother him and that we can take another picture with him later. We took the picture and after 30 minutes we did another family picture with him included.

Today my brother noticed my frame picture and asked me why I didn‚Äôt use the one where he was in. I told him that I would prefer to have just the family in my frame. He got really upset and I could swear he was on the verge of crying. He told me ""oh ok"" and went to his room. From that moment he is acting cold with me and is avoiding everyone in the house. My mother even asked him why he is acting like this. I told my friends what happened and they called me an asshole for it.

I didn‚Äôt mean to offend him but I just wanted to have a family picture in my room. I was hoping he wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it as none of my other friends or anyone else in the party cared. AITA for this?

138,AITA for calling the police on my neighbors' kids?,2189,Not the A-hole,315,hp1qz0,1594461074.0,"So I \[32F\] moved into a new house in January. The people next door to me have three sons ranging in age from about 10-14. 

Fast-forward to March, and I‚Äôm working from home and these kids are home from school. Soon after lockdown started, the kids started playing in my yard. I initially just bit my tongue and dealt with it, because I was sympathetic to the fact that their worlds had just been turned upside down. However, as the weeks and months went on they started to test my limits. They took to having nerf gun fights in my yard and didn‚Äôt pick up the bullets and brought the dog into my yard and let it shit in my yard. I went outside a few times and asked them to please be respectful and clean up after themselves, keep the volume down, and stay away from my doors and windows, but the message never seemed to stick. Last week, I came home from a jog, and one of them was hiding in my garage (which I had left open) as part of their nerf gun game. Not realizing he was there, I closed the garage and walked into my house. The kid then came into the house and asked me to let him out.

I told him that under no circumstances was it okay for him to come inside of a stranger‚Äôs home, and that he should have knocked and it was not okay that he just let himself in. I didn't yell at him, and understand that he was probably scared because he was stuck in the garage.

I knocked on the door of the neighbors‚Äô house after I calmed down a bit, and told the parents that I didn‚Äôt want their kids playing in my yard. They were pretty taken aback and said that it was normal for kids to play in other people's yards in this neighborhood, but I stood my ground. The conversation was awkward but civil, and the kids seemingly stayed away after that.

Fast forward to earlier today. I‚Äôm in my living room working out, and I turn around to find two of the kids standing in my yard watching me through the window. I took a picture of them for evidence, then called the police non-emergency line and told them that two middle-school aged boys trespassed and were watching me work out in just a sports bra through my window. The police came about an hour later, and I showed them the picture and gave the background of the situation. The police said they would go talk to the parents.

The dad just came and knocked on my door, and told me that I totally overreacted and that his kids were just looking through the window to see if I had noticed them out there playing, and that they had no sexual motives. (I never told the police that they did, though I guess mentioning the detail of being in just a sports bra might have implied that). He told me that I wasted police resources and upset his kids.

139,AITA for reporting an undisclosed camera?,2167,Not the A-hole,207,hq0ckm,1594610867.0,"For some background, a group of girlfriends were supposed to go on a girls trip and double up as a bachelorette party but had to cancel due to COVID. Questionable on if the wedding would still happen but not wanting to put the party on hold forever, I decided to book a house with a pool to have a shower.

The place was great but it stated no parties. It was just going to be the seven of us and we were going to have a shut in. Nothing wild, just seven girls drinking beer and ordering in pizza so I thought we would be cool. 

The day comes and one of the girls brings a banner and wants to take down a price of art so we can take a group photo. She takes the piece down and sets it in the hallway. We hang up the banner and balloons and have the food set up for our friend to arrive. 

It‚Äôs three hours in when I start to receive messages from the owner reiterating that no parties are allowed and only the original 7 girls are a allowed to be there. They also stated the neighbors would be watching and would report any loud music and parties. I find that odd as we hadn‚Äôt been playing any music and hadn‚Äôt even made it out to the pool yet. I mention it seems like we are being watched and then we find the two cameras in the living room. We realized we were being watched by the owner and one of the cameras is pointed right at our banner and the main part of the living room we were hanging out in. We were obviously upset and moved outside after searching for more cameras. I double checked the listing and it said nothing about there bring cameras onsite, which is against the service we booked through policy. At that point we were all drinking and in swimsuits. Some of the girls were flicking off the cameras because we could see the little red light turning on recording us and they assumed he was watching us.

I called into the service that night and waited on hold for 50 minutes before giving up. We couldn‚Äôt find cameras anywhere else but the living room so we decided to stay.

The next morning we get up and clean and leave the place spotless, I had still planned on reporting the cameras so I wanted the place to be very clean so he would have no reason to report any issues with us. I even brought the trash back to my house so he could complain about excessive recycling.

I was thinking about just letting it go when I receive a message from the owner saying we damaged a piece of art and he wanted $2k. I had a picture showing a scratch in the painting before my friend moved it. My friend who moved the photo stated there was no damage when she put the photo back up. 

Because of this I decided to bite the bullet and wait on hold to report the cameras. I had to wait 1.5 hours on hold but was able to make a case. Their response time was very slow but they refunded me the night and removed his listing. I haven‚Äôt heard back on the damage claim.

That being said, the accident left her with a TBI non the less. She has been left with a multitude of issues to work through that her neurologist said may get better with time or not.

I (47F) have a teenage daughter (16f). Her dad died of cancer when she was a baby, and since then I have remarried to my current husband (48m). My husband is an essential worker so he is still going to work all day, every day.

My daughter is severely disabled and in her case, even though she is 16 she cannot stay home alone, so whenever I have to go out of the house to do something essential, she comes with me. We take a lot of precautions (bring along hand sanitizer and masks, stay away from other people, etc.).

On Friday I had to buy a few things from the grocery store, so my daughter came with me. Once we are there and shopping, someone who worked there came up to me and asked me why did I bring my daughter along. I gently explained about my daughter and then the grocery store worker said something along these lines ""your daughter looks pretty old, she should learn to stay home alone. Her disabilities are not an excuse for that.""

Here is the part where I might have been TA. I completely lost it, I yelled about how it was rude to stereotype people, it was rude to dismiss someone's disabilities and loads of stuff.

I have 2 kids from a prior relationship (10M and 7F). My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. So recently my oldest has been voicing some concerns to me regarding my boyfriend. He says that my boyfriend makes him feel stupid because he scolds him often for little things and never talks to him about these things without yelling. I guess I never noticed because I literally work so much (60+ hour weeks in healthcare). Well, given the fact that I just lost my job from Covid (I worked at a very small local walk in clinic) I have been around and have seen this first hand. My boyfriend yells so much more than I have ever witnessed personally. It's bad. He is not harming them at all, hes just being fucking childish, to put it lightly. Especially considering nearly everything he lectures my kids about is stuff he does all the time. 

Examples: leaving the bathroom and bedroom lights on, not taking care of his dirty laundry, leaving trash in miscellaneous places, pissing on the fucking toilet seat, stomps his feet, doesnt help with ANY household tasks, etc.

Anyways, because my son brought this to my attention and I actually started watching out for it, I have a huge distaste for him now. So I brought it up with him. He became insanely defensive over this and told me that he does it because they need to learn these things. At first I said ""They aren't going to learn from you yelling. If you want them to listen, show them how to do these things versus doing the exact same things you are yelling at them for"". He told me he was an adult and wasnt going to be lectured. So I said fine, dont lecture my kids again then if you cant follow your own fucking rules. Now I'm an AH apparently because he ""made the choice"" to step in and be a dad and ""gave up everything for us"". So AITA?

Our wedding day came and went... and not only did his brother not show up... NOONE from his family did. AITA for never wanting to see or speak to them again?

Just a little more info for anyone asking.

145,"AITA for not filling my brothers water receptacle before he goes to bed after he threw it at me, meaning my mum ""had to""?",2004,Not the A-hole,329,hocafi,1594360651.0,"Literally 2 minutes since this happened, on mobile warning, the usual. 

My younger brother (14) keeps a drink next to his bed, pretty normal. This drink is in a plastic watermelon cup.

Now, because he's incompetent, he ""has to"" have someone else fill it and pass it to him (he can do it on his own, he just refuses to 99% of the time).

When he wants it filled, he will shout. What will he shout you ask?
""OI, BOY! WATERMELON!""

The irony of a 14 year old calling his older brother ""boy"" is not lost on me, but I deal with it.

So far, I have described a normal night; now for what happened tonight. 

Tonight, he screamed at me with the windows open while I was half-running to the bathroom before I shat myself (he was in there for 15 minutes while I filled the dishwasher); so I responded ""not now, I'm busy"".

His response to this was to: jump out of bed, shout again, and throw the cup as hard as he could at the now locked bathroom door. 

Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but I'm already pretty certain that he's an asshole at this point, but now enters my mum.

About 5 minutes later (nice crap, hand washing, and tooth brushing) I emerged from the bathroom and began to walk along the landing when my mum said ""are you going to fill his melon now?""

I responded with a quick ""no, I'm not going to stand for him shouting and throwing things at me to get what he wants.""

To this, she sighed, walked to the bathroom, and filled it herself (less than 30 seconds). While doing this she said ""you're an arsehole you know. You should have just done it and not made me do it.""

[4 minutes later] 

Mum walks past my door and says ""it would make life so much easier if you weren't an arsehole to your brother all the time""

I didn't respond, so she repeated it louder.

""Mum, I heard the first time""
""Well you should have responded then, arsehole""

And she walked away. 

At this point, I might as well change my legal name to arsehole considering how often I get called it, but oh well.

148,AITA for not wanting to bond with my potential stepbrother until there's a DNA test?,1936,Not the A-hole,251,ho1ynx,1594325381.0,"I'm 16f, with a 13 year old brother. My mum (34f) met my soon-to-be-stepdad (36m) when I was about 8. I really love my stepdad, he's a better dad to me and my brother than our bio dad. He proposed to mum last New Year.

This kid, a 12 year old, just sort of popped up after they got engaged. Back in January the mum came up to us, with her kid in tow, and in front of everyone basically said ""remember me? this is your son"" so we all found out at the same time. It's not like dad cheated on mum or anything, but there's something about this kid that's a little sus.

First off, the kid looks nothing like him. Stepdad has dark hair/eyes and the kid is blonde w green eyes. The mum is also blonde w green eyes, but she's got dark roots so I'm 90% sure she bleaches it, in which case where did the blonde hair come from. My stepdad is also pretty well off, to such an extent that everyone thinks mum's a golddigger when he only made that money after he met her. Plus he's never met his son. In 12 years. And the son and mum are literally living within 20 minutes drive of us and have lived in the same town as dad for the son's entire life.

Mum and dad were talking about my ""stepbrother""'s birthday coming up. I asked mum and dad if they were going to get a DNA test on him or what. They gave each other this look and I called them out on it, and then they said I was old enough to know this - they booked a DNA test, paid for it, all the mum had to do was get the son there. She called to say she'd forgotten and they were already halfway to her parent's house. The house was 6 hours away, so they couldn't just go grab him, and since then she keeps ""forgetting"" to send the sample in. I mean come the fuck on.

This woman 1000% sounds like a con artist to me, and I've said as much to mum and dad. Dad keeps calling this kid his ""other son"" or his ""second son"" (with my brother being the OG) and keeps saying my brother and this kid should hang out. He's basically got selective blindness for this kid. My actual brother looks more like him than his alleged son does.

I've said I'm not going to his birthday party and I don't trust this kid (Edit: I don't trust that he is my father's son, and I don't trust his mother specifically, I doubt a 12 year old is involved in a con), and I got my brother to side with me, so neither of us want to go to the party, but mum and dad have said that they know there's a chance they're not related but if this is actually his son/my stepbrother then it would be nice to be involved, and if not then nothing lost nothing gained. They've said they won't make me but asked me to reconsider. I also asked my friend and she said that I shouldn't be getting hung up on someone not being related to my dad given that I'm not related to him.

AITA for not wanting to bond with him until we get DNA tests?

Info: my parents paid for/booked the test back in January, within a couple weeks of the mum/kid showing up the first time.

We‚Äôve tried talking to Emma about him multiple times and remind her often that she can always stay with us if she feels unsafe, but she brushes us off and denies everything. 

A couple of weeks ago, we (Emma, Dan, me, wife, and our 2 kids 9f and 5m) were eating dinner together at my house. My son accidentally dropped a plate and broke it. We didn‚Äôt think it was that big of a deal but Dan started yelling at my son and telling him that he was a ‚Äúworthless, useless little shit‚Äù. I had to step between them to get him to stop and by then I was seeing red. I told Dan to get the fuck out of my house and that if he came back I‚Äôd call the police on him for trespassing. Then I told Emma that she was welcome to come back anytime as long as Dan was not with her. They both left immediately. 

Well, we‚Äôve been worried about Emma since then so we decided to invite her over for dinner again. We reminded her that Dan was not welcome and she said that she understood.

150,AITA for being upset my wife didn‚Äôt make me a quesadilla?,1901,Asshole,536,hr3anu,1594768393.0,"Ok just to make sure we are clear my wife and I get along great. It‚Äôs a great marriage. This happened about a month ago and it wasn‚Äôt even a big deal, but it‚Äôs one of those we both think we are right situations. This in no way affects our marriage now. I just want to know who was right.

Here‚Äôs the scenario:
I work from home, so every morning I wake up around 6:45 and start work around 7:15. My wife will sleep in usually till around 8, and then she will wake up and make breakfast for both of us. She does this every day and she always cooks a great breakfast. And I am super appreciative. 

So one morning my wife comes to my office and says ‚ÄúI just really don‚Äôt feel like cooking this morning. Would you be ok to eat cereal?‚Äù
I said something along the lines of ‚ÄúOf course baby. That‚Äôs totally fine‚Äù

My wife brings me a bowl of cereal and I happily start to eat. Maybe 3 minutes later, I get the chance to take a short break from work and I think to myself ‚Äúoh I‚Äôll go eat my breakfast with my wife‚Äù. When I go to the kitchen my wife is eating a freshly cooked quesadilla. 

Now did I TRULY care? Not really. But years of listening to my mom guilt trip my dad must have kicked in. I said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that you didn‚Äôt feel like cooking, you just didn‚Äôt feel like cooking for me.‚Äù

Now my wife felt bad and like she had been caught and she got up and made me a quesadilla even though I said I was happy to eat cereal. 

Her point of view was this: Making a quesadilla isn‚Äôt really cooking. For her that was the same as cereal.

My point of view is this: It‚Äôs cooking. And the fact that she felt bad kinda shows that I was a little bit right. 

Again it doesn‚Äôt matter and I love my wife very much. She makes a wonderful breakfast for me everyday and I have no reason to complain. We are both super over it. What are y‚Äôall thoughts?

Edits:
For everyone saying I‚Äôm a bad husband and that you feel bad for my wife, I just want to reiterate that our marriage is great. Yes my wife enjoys cooking and does a majority of the cooking, but I also do a lot around the house. It is definitely a partnership with both of us working together. 

As to why am I bringing this up a month later and I must be so petty and immature, we had quesadillas for breakfast today. I had forgotten about it until this morning. I thought it would be an interesting discussion. 

Lastly, I love and appreciate my wife very much. On my 15 minute break this morning we hugged and talked and even danced in the living room
 while our dog watched on the couch. As much as you may want to turn this one incident into what must be a miserable experience for my poor abused wife that is just not an accurate depiction of our marriage.

Now all that being said, in this case IATA. If my wife decided she didn‚Äôt want cereal and instead wanted to cook herself a full course meal she can do that and I shouldn‚Äôt feel butthurt about it. My comment showed that my first instinct was to be petty and make her feel guilty. Even if I didn‚Äôt intend that, that‚Äôs what I did. 

Thank you for everyone‚Äôs comments.",False,1594749395.0,2020-07-14 16:13:13

153,AITA for not giving my brother any inheritance money?,1828,Not the A-hole,245,holvv7,1594401913.0,"Backstory:

My brother (27M) and I (23M) have been raised by a single dad. Mom died when we were teenagers and these were dark times.

My bro was very close to our mom and her death really messed him up and he started doing drugs. I‚Äôm not anti-drugs, but he did some pretty fucked up shit and I lost a lot of respect for him when his addiction pretty much took over his life after a few years. It felt like I had lost my brother.

Our dad tried his best to get him help but he just kept relapsing and relapsing, it was bad. He gave him an ultimatum, either stop doing drugs and be a part of this family or continue and be disowned. Ofc he chose the latter and basically told us to go fuck ourselves.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

My dad unfortunately passed away about a year ago and I was the sole inheritor. He left me a hefty sum that I really don‚Äôt need since I already own a pretty successful business. I was planning on investing it or just donate it to people who really need it.

The problem arises when my bro contacts me (mind you we hadn‚Äôt talked for a few years) and asks me if he could have some of dad‚Äôs money because he ‚Äúreally needed it‚Äù. Knowing his problem with drugs, i‚Äôm a little skeptic and asks him if he‚Äôs still using. He tells me no but I don‚Äôt really believe him so I ask him if he‚Äôd be willing to do a drugs test. If it came back negative, I would give him half.

He then gets really fucking mad, cursing me for not believing him, calling me selfish and greedy. We got into a heated argument and he finally admitted he was still in fact using (no shit) but he needed money to get his life back on tracks. I eventually told him he wouldn‚Äôt see a cent unless he got 100% clean. He got pissed off yet again and told me to go fuck myself (again).

I really want to see my bro get his life back and i‚Äôm sure this money could really help him. But I don‚Äôt trust him and definitely do NOT want to contribute to his addiction. I would never forgive myself if he OD‚Äôd because of the money I gave him. 

And also, I still see it as my dad‚Äôs money. He didn‚Äôt put him in the will for a reason and I feel like I‚Äôd be betraying my dad‚Äôs wish to see his son get clean if I gave him money even though he‚Äôs still using.

Sorry if some sentences don‚Äôt make sense, i‚Äôm a little drunk.

AITA?

Edit: Thanks to everyone who took time to answer, yall are awesome!

I‚Äôll have a conversation with my bro within the next few days to discuss our future and the possibility of him getting into rehab with the inheritance money. Therapy will also be needed. Don‚Äôt worry, i‚Äôm not giving him a cent unless he gets clean.  I‚Äôll probably put the money in a trust anyway, i‚Äôll talk to my lawyer too. If something happens, i‚Äôll update.

154,AITA for not helping the guy who crashed into my car?,1812,Not the A-hole,218,hqccyn,1594662055.0,"Link to pic at the bottom 

My (24m) car was written off three weeks ago in an accident that was not my fault, the other drive is not insured expects me to be responsible for their vehicle and income.

 Tjippie was a beautiful suzuki jimny 1.3L manual. She was 2017 with 50000km on the clock. I only got to drive her for 6 months.

at 9:30 am on an overcast morning I left to run a quick errand for work. On my way home I arrived at an intersection where all of the traffic lights were not working. The roads were busy and I patiently waited my turn, I wanted to cross straight over the 4 way intersection.

When it was my turn to go I got T-boned. I crossed over the first half and when I was in the middle of the second half I was hit at a serious pace. My car spun around for a full 360 before coming to a stop. Thank fully there were no serious injuries or deaths. The drivers first response was to demand money so that he could flee the scene. After a rather heated back and fourth, while i was still completely in shock, the police arrive and start helping us process the accident and get traffice moving again. They were absolutely amazing.

It wasn't even my fault! if it had been we would have knocked bumbers, exchanged details and fixed the cars. However he T-boned me at such a speed that my car is completely written off, theres no way you can generate enough force in 4m to write off a small 4x4 from a complete stand still.

The next day I get numerous phonecalls from his wife, his passengers employer and many more people he was in contact with. All saying that because I crashed into him I was responisible for fixing their cars. I simply sent them pictures of the accident and told them to take it up with insurance. As I was sure that being a taxi drive the guy must have third party insurance through his company at very least!

It has now come to my knowledge that the driver was not insured and was not operating under a valid taxi license and is therefore not going to be able to get any assistance fixing his car.

In the time that has passed I have learned that I am going to lose about R50000 (rands I am South African) to repaying the loan at the bank and insurance. This leaves me well short of the deposit I need to buy another Jimny and I am quite honestly crushed. All that work to finally get my dream car only to have it ripped from my hands so soon?

I have just recieved another phonecall from the wife of the man who hit me asking when I am going to pay them and how much I intend on giving them to fix the car as they don't have any other way to make money. This woman gave me sob stories about dropping the insurance a week ago because they couldn't afford it any more and how lockdown has impacted their earning. How it was my fault that there was an accident and so on.

I lost the plot, told her to take me to court if they wanted R1 out of me, I told her to leave me alone, delete my number and thats what you get for driving without insurance.

About a year ago, she found out I used to box when I was younger and ever since then, I feel that her behavior changed drastically. 

She'll often antagonize people when she's with me or when I'm around, like at a party or something. For example, if we're driving somewhere and another car drives dangerously, she'll shout at them or give them the finger. This never happened before she found out I can handle myself in a tough situation. I told her to stop the first feew times it happened after I spotted the pattern and she'd stop for a while, but it didn't last. I finally had enough the other day after she got into an argument with a guy at the supermarket over whose turn it is at the register. 

I intervened and pulled her away to the side and then asked her what the fuck was all that about again. I told her she was acting like a child, cause she reminded me of my younger brother who'd always get over-confident and start shit with older kids when our other brother and I were around to protect him.

She didn't say much at the time, but when we got home, she exploded on me. She told me that it was wrong of me to take the other guy's side and on top of that, it was humiliating to be reprimanded like that in public.

I told her that it's just as humiliating to have my gf starting arguments left and right when she's with me, and I gave her some more examples of her behavior over the last 12 months or so. 

She then started saying how she was right in this particular case in the supermarket and I should still have taken her side.

I then told her I didn't give a fuck about who was right in this particular argument, only about that it became an argument in the first place. And then I asked her why she was escalating those situations.

She said she wasn't and that was still no excuse for being mean to her in front of other people.

I told her I wasn't being mean, but if she's acting like a child, she'll get treated like a child.

In my school, we have a dress code, your hair cannot be dyed a bright colour, such as blue or pink. Many white girls in my school had their hair dip dyed, the top half of their hair was brown and the bottom was blonde, (i mentioned race because it‚Äôs important in this case). I (a black girl) loved the look and got dip dyed braid extensions on my hair. My school has never had a problem with girls wearing braid extensions, but when I walked into school the day I dip dyed the extensions, they were on my case.

It was the exact same colour as the white girls‚Äô hair, but they took me out of my first lesson and told me if I don‚Äôt remove them, I won‚Äôt be allowed in classes, and would have to learn in an isolated room. I refused to take out my hair as my mum spent ¬£70 on my hair. I was in isolation for 2 weeks. Working in an isolated room was very difficult as the teacher had to send your work to your email and you couldn‚Äôt get any help from said teacher as they weren‚Äôt physically there.

After the isolation was up, they put me on behavioural report. I had to stay behind class for an extra half hour to have a private talk with my teacher about my ‚Äòbehaviour‚Äô but during this talk he said and I quote, ‚ÄúIf they aren‚Äôt out before Monday i‚Äôll cut them off myself.‚Äù I hated him after that. I struggled to show him respect so I resented him. I wouldn‚Äôt respond to him in lessons, I couldn‚Äôt even look him in the eyes. 

Of course I got my mum involved, i‚Äôm not gonna get into that though but he told her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way‚Äù, and that‚Äôs not an apology at all. I feel like it was a racial attack.

My (26f) boyfriend (26m) decided to throw a party with a good amount of his friends and family. We had been together at this point in time for eight months. 

He spoke of his siblings often and positively so I was excited to meet them. At the party I met a couple of the last remaining friends of his I haven‚Äôt been introduced too. As well as his 24 year old brother who is autistic, though I did not know that at the time !

I was talking to one of his friends that I‚Äôm not too familiar with, and she brought up a story about an autistic child who passed away a couple years ago as it was related to the protests going on. 

I then said that was tragic and that I hope they come up with a way to do prenatal testing for autism, so that people don‚Äôt have to suffer with it in the future.My boyfriend‚Äôs brother heard this conversation and came over to us who, again I did not know was autistic. He was very angry and called me a eugenicist in front of everyone, and said that he hoped that prenatal testing never existed because of people like me. 

I felt embarrassed with this happening in front of everyone else and left. I later asked my boyfriend why he didn‚Äôt tell me his brother had autism, because I wouldn‚Äôt have said anything like that if I knew. He said he shouldn‚Äôt have had to tell me because I shouldn‚Äôt hold those beliefs at all. He said it was very disappointing knowing that I thought like that and that I owed his brother an apology and a renunciation of my views. I disagreed and after a little bit of squabbling he just said let‚Äôs forget about he whole thing.

The reason why I‚Äôm asking now is that I saw his brother yesterday and he still won‚Äôt talk to me for more than a few sentences, which is progress but far too slow for my taste, so maybe I should apologize.

One day, my brother (who doesn't have his liscense) showed me a GMC Jimmy For sale and said he said he didn‚Äôt have the $2000 the seller was asking. 

He then asks if I could buy half of it. I thought it was a joke, so I laughed. When he said he was serious, I assumed he meant he would pay me back. He assured me that was not his intention, his exact words were ‚Äúyou have $30,000 in the bank. $1,000 is nothing to you! Why can‚Äôt you just be kind to me for once?‚Äù 

I was very upset at this point and utterly speechless, except for the word ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù

One day after that, he approaches me with my mother with whom I have a very strained relationship with. He, however, doesn‚Äôt.

She said ‚Äú(op), your brother and I have talked about you purchasing half of this Jimmy. We agreed it would be mutually beneficial for you two if you paid for half, and he will wash your Ford in return. He only has $1200 in the bank, he can‚Äôt do this without your help.‚Äù (he lives with her for free‚Ä¶ and has no money saved???) 

I explained that a car wash is not worth $1000 and that I worked very hard for every penny I earned. I explained that I am using it for school. I asked her why she couldn‚Äôt help him instead, if it was so important to her he got this car.

My mother and brother started to yell at me about how selfish I was being and how it is nothing to me, I should just do it. I began screaming back at them about why I don‚Äôt feel I should have to hand over my hard earned money and ultimately my mother called me disrespectful and stormed off with my brother who was in tears at this point. 

I explained the situation to my dad (who has custody of me) and he sided with me and said that under no circumstances was I to pay.

My partner is 42, and he has a 10 year old girl.

He separated from Girl's mother when she was 4.  I met him about a year later. After about two years into the relationship he asked about living together.

Since they sold the house in the divorce and were renting, and I inherited a property from my grandparents a few years prior - it sort of made sense they'd move in with me.

It's a 3 bedroom house, and Girl was given my Uncle's childhood room.

I have told my partner prior, though, that while I like his daughter, and she is welcome in my home and life, I will not be a stepmother to Girl. Please  do not take this is me being unkind to her. Girl and I get on pretty ok - we do nice things together like baking cakes and do little roadtrips and the like.

I have said, though, that any specific ""parent"" duties I would not do.

- One of the big ones is taking and bringing her to school. I think that's his responsibility. Partly also  because I work 10 to 6 and school hours don't really mesh well with my job. I sleep in while partner brings Girl to work, and I'm still at work when Girl needs picking up. Partner had a pre-set routine that worked with this. I do not intend to change my work hours, let alone my job to accommodate this.
- Same for hobbies. I do not want to be the person being her chauffeur for hobbies.
- PTA meetings and everything school related (though I will obviously help her with homework if she has a question I know the answer to).
- Cooking. I have said I will cook twice a week, 3 times max. The other times Partner can cook, we order takeway, I don't care. I try to have a nice family meal when I DO cook, but I don't want to be in the kitchen all the time. I rarely cooked for myself - and frankly I think it's also ok to have a non-hot meal once a week or so.

Things like this. I think it's generally reasonable. But lately Partner has been complaining he wants me to do more, wants me to be more involved on these things - especially the bringing to school we clash on, but that one's a hard line for me.

Another thing is he found out that I'm leaving a fair amount of my inheritence to my niece, nephew and my favorite cousin (and Partner!) - but not Girl. He is quite upset about this. I have told him that, if anything, after less than two years together it's at the very least premature to expect that.

When she turned 18, she moved across the country and cut contact with both myself and my parents after getting into a big fight with my parents. I was upset but I understood that she wanted a new life.

A year later, I got a call saying that she had had a baby and that she was missing so I immediately flew across the country. I did my best to take care of her baby with the help of her best friend but she was never found and eventually pronounced dead.

That was about four years ago. A few months after my sister was declared dead, I officially decided to move to the city she had been living in. I got a job and got into a relationship with her friend and together we raised my nephew. 

I fought with my parents quite a bit about this as they wanted to adopt the baby but I knew my sister would want me to raise him and eventually my parents also agreed. 

When the baby started talking he always referred to me and my partner as dad/daddy and we never corrected him as he was just a baby/toddler. However, now that he's a bit older, a few people (my parents and some friends) have said that we should teach the baby to call us as uncles rather than dads because we're not his real parents.

I feel like I am his father, I've raised him since he was six months old and my partner has been there since the day he was born.

However, I do feel guilty because his true parent is my sister and if anything he should call her mom. He knows about her and knows she was his mother and that she is no longer with us but it's hard to explain to a four year old.

164,AITA for pulling my daughter out of mum's dance studio?,1569,Not the A-hole,223,hoagt0,1594354683.0,"My mum is a dance teacher, she put me in dance classes from a young age, and I enjoyed it at first, but then I began to compete in actual competitions and it caused some serious health issues for me. I was anxious, I developed an eating disorder, and my self esteem crashed, and between classes and home there was no escape from mum, who at one point had me and my sister practice for 8 hours a day in the name of winning a competition.

I have a daughter, age 10. When she was about 5, her friends started dance lessons at my mother's studio (the only local studio at the time). I agreed to enroll my daughter in mum's studio on the condition that she didn't compete, just learned, which mum agreed to, but by the time my daughter was 8 mum approached me saying that my daughter is really good, everyone else in her class is going to this competition, and mum thinks it would be good for her. My daughter begged me to let her compete, so I agreed.

She's done about 6 competitions so far. They all went fine. Her positions in order were 6th, 2nd, 1st, 1st, 1st, 2nd. I am immensely proud of her, and I've told her so, but after that latest result my 10 year old had a full on panic attack because she felt like a 2nd meant she was getting worse, and she called herself a ""loser"". I called mum and asked her to give her my daughter a few words of encouragement but mum said she would do no such thing because 2nd place isn't something to be celebrated after three 1st places and my mum wasn't going to pretend it was okay. I asked mum what exactly she said to my daughter post results, and mum admitted she said basically that to my daughter after she was announced 2nd. I hung up and when my daughter calmed down she confirmed that she felt good about it until ""nanny called me a loser"". I emailed the studio in a professional manner saying that I didn't think they were the right fit for my daughter, so she would no longer be attending. I am planning on enrolling her in a relatively new studio that has just opened up and doesn't do competitions. I ran this decision by my daughter first. Aside from worrying that her nan might be upset with her, she's fine with this and thinks the new studio might be a good idea (helped by one of her closest friends going there).

Mum, however, has said she can't believe I'm doing this to her and I need to un-quit her studio, saying that she was honest with my daughter, it's a competitive environment, she needs to take criticism, and how do I expect my daughter to grow as a dancer if I pull her out at the first ""tantrum"". I talked to my sister about it, as she's the only one who really knows what mum does to the same extent as me, and she said ""I hate to admit it, but mum's right"" and went on to say that if my daughter wants to dance then she might need to get competitive every now and then and I can't protect her from everything.

166,AITA For Snapping At My Roommate About Wanting Alone Time,1532,Not the A-hole,205,hqwmx3,1594738078.0," Throwaway account

A few months ago I (27F) invited my friend (41M) to move into my one-bedroom apartment. He needed a place to stay, and I wanted to pay off some debt.

I split the apartment into my room (living room), his room (bedroom), and kitchen/bathroom. This works for me because I like to keep to myself and need a bunch of time to recharge. I'm a homebody-even before COVID. He is not.

I have a history of depressive bouts and have been seeing a therapist for 3 years. I usually recognize the symptoms--overwhelming sadness, numbness, hopelessness, spurts of hurt and anger--and I disconnect from people around me. I usually try to explain, but its incredibly difficult when I don't even understand why I feel the way I do. Its become worse during quarantine, but I am actively seeking help.

Tonight I started feeling very down while working in my room. He's cooking in the kitchen and starts talking to me about Hamilton. I'm feeling really sad trying to reply but I give up and decide to be honest. I say ""Hey, you haven't done anything wrong, but I can't talk right now. I feel awful, emotionally.""He says ""Okay, is there anything I can do."" I say ""no, but thank you,"" and go on with what I was doing- not thinking anything of it.

10 minutes later he says ""I'm really irritated with you right now. I know this drill. You're gonna hole up for the next 4/5 days and I'm just gonna have to deal with it. It brings everything down. Maybe you can't feel that but it does."" I say ""what do you want me to do? I stay in my room. I don't know what else to do.""

He tells me that he's been gone all day doing stuff, and I just need to get outside, get some air; he wants to help. I said ""I'm doing the best I can,"" and he replied ""This is your best? I don't think this is the best you can do."" This really affects him. He says he has to prepare to come home and have to do a ""study hall"" (be alone in his room) because the energy is so negative.

I say that I feel judged and I know he wants a roommate to be his best friend and I think we have different values around that as I'm okay with sharing space without emotional closeness. He calls me condescending and I snap. I mockingly point out how he told me to cure my depression by ""going outside,"" and that if the energy is bad then lets whip out the fucking sage stick.

I don't see anything wrong with staying in my room when I'm not in good mental health space. I told him I needed space and it wasn't personal and I didn't have the room to be diplomatic. If he wanted to fight about it I was in a petty mood and would. He told me I was being nasty and he wasn't going to talk and walked out.

AITA in this? I know I could have been nicer in my responses, but I feel like this was completely avoidable and I tried to communicate clearly and effectively at the top.

EDIT FAQ INFO:
- He has the bedroom because he doesn‚Äôt have furniture. I gave him my bed/tables/dresser and put an air mattress in the living room for me where my desk/couch/TV is.
-The apartment is not open concept. Each room has a standard doorway. The living room has two on opposite ends.

Okay so there is a slight chance I am TA, but I'm honestly not sure. Help me out Reddit!

So I (22f) am getting married next August! Yay Wedding bells! My fiance (22m) and I have been paying for most of the wedding ourselves, with some help from my mother. It's important to note that 99% of the wedding is being paid for by us, and we never ask for money, we just don't refuse it. I will also note that we just had a baby in the beginning of the year, so we are a bit stressed out with that at the moment. 

The issue comes in with my mother actually. It's starting to seem like she believes that, because she is helping pay for portions of my wedding, she gets a say in what we do. It's also worth mentioning that my grandmother took over my mother's wedding, so I'm starting to think shes trying to live through mine. But that's not the point. 

This morning, I was talking to my mom about the guest list, and mentioned that we are below the max amount we are allowed (we picked a small wedding package, so we have a number we need to stay under). Well, this made my mom happy, because now my grandmother's cousin can be invited to the wedding! 

I told my mother no. I've only met this woman once, and it was at my baby shower, after I was told that she was invited whether I liked it or not because ""family"". I also told her thaty fiance and I have already made the decision not to invite people we barely know/have only met a couple times from BOTH sides of the family. So no, we are not going to invite her and her husband, we don't want to.  

Y'all, you would have thought I committed a sin by telling her this. She proceeds to tell me I'm unreasonable, it's only two people so why do I care, ""you should be willing to invite your grandmother's cousin to your only wedding"", and when I held my ground, she got quiet before ending the call. 

AITA here? My fiance says that I'm not, but I love my mom and don't want to upset her. I'm just not comfortable with essentially a stranger at my wedding.

My son (then 8) and husband picked out all racing furniture that I knew would not age well with my son. I said this. But I was outvoted.

Sure enough, in 8 years time, our son was sleeping in the guest room as my husband refused to part with the racing furniture. It‚Äôs since been retired and is valuable, apparently. So, the room remained a shrine to our son‚Äôs childhood and it‚Äôs sort of creepy. Our daughter‚Äôs room aged with her. But our son‚Äôs stayed still. 

Anyway, now our son is 22 and living at home after college as he saves up for an apartment . He says he doesn‚Äôt care what I do with his old room or the furniture.

He refused for years.

Finally, I just made a plan. I hired people to take the furniture into storage and made sure it was protected. It‚Äôll be there if my son has kids or if he/my husband wants to sell it. I have plans to repaint and turn it into a guest bedroom that we had to give up.

She had undiagnosed, untreated, bipolar. She was never physical but she was volatile. During her depressive times she could be straight up neglectful. Our dad was the MVP during our childhood and was responsible for most of our care.

All that said, my sister and I both had a pretty different relationship with her after she was diagnosed. The timeline goes like this: Sister moves out at 18, I move out a year later, also 18, both of us go low contact with our mother.

When sister is 21 and I am 20, our mother finally gets diagnosed and starts treatment. She starts weekly therapy and is put on medication. Her mood stabilizes and she becomes a very different person (In a good way).

Mother apologizes to us both, I accept it, sister does not. Fast forward 6 years. I have a really good relationship with our mom, sister talks to her maybe once a year. 6 months ago, Mom gets diagnosed with ovarian cancer, stage 4. She already had pretty poor health and declined very quickly. She died 2 weeks ago.

We didn‚Äôt have a funeral but my sister, our dad, and me got together for a night and had our own service. 

Last night I get a video call from my sister and she is absolutely plastered. I see that she has a couple friends over and they are drinking. I asked her what‚Äôs up and she starts singing that song ‚ÄúDing Dong the Witch is Dead‚Äù and her friends are joining in the background. I asked her what the fuck and she start going on this drunk rant. Basically, she threw a party to celebrate our mom‚Äôs death. She absolutely unloaded on me about how happy she was that mom was dead and how she deserved it for how shit a mom she was.

I couldn‚Äôt take it and hung up. I sent her a very long message about what a disgusting, hateful person she was. That mom tried for years to make it up to us and she rejected her at every turn. I loved my mom and her death is an absolute tragedy in my eyes. For my sister to actually celebrate it is beyond fucked up to me. Not to mention hugely disrespectful to me and our dad, who are both actively grieving.

She read the message this morning and basically told me to fuck off, that she didn‚Äôt own our mom anything, and that I can get the fuck out of her life. I‚Äôm just angry and sad. I said some harsh things to her but I don‚Äôt really regret it, as I do think what she did was horrible. 

I just got off the phone with a close friend of mine, who I told the story too. She thinks that I should have more empathy for my sister. I don‚Äôt really agree since my sister clearly doesn‚Äôt have any empathy for me.

So, I need some more opinions before I make any decisions here. Was I the asshole to my sister or was she the asshole to me?

We have enough in common that I like doing things in group settings with her and we even chat on our own occasionally, but she's definitely closer to my husband. She's been with her own husband since I came around, but I always got the sense, from Jane herself, from old photos, and a few old anecdotes from some of my husband's other friends, that Jane wanted to date my husband before she met hers, and he just never showed any interest. So throughout the years there has been a little weirdness, but nothing serious. He was her Man of Honour, a few gushy tributes to him on his birthday over Facebook, or the odd sitting on his lap in a big group photo, but never overly flirtatious.

Fast forward to a few months ago and Jane became pregnant. She immediately asked my husband to be the godfather and he was thrilled. I wasn't surprised, was happy for him, internally a bit ""Of course she did"". But through the months she's turned weird. She's wanted my husband to come with her and her husband baby shopping once or twice. Even asked how my husband felt about him and I being the first people to meet the baby when they're born. It's nice that she included me but clearly it's about my husband. And then it escalated - she announced she was going to name the baby after my husband. Not just his name, but her facebook announcement said, ""After my dearest and best friend John.!""  I mentioned that that was weird to my husband and he just said ""I think it's a nice tribute"". 

This past weekend was her (very small COVID-friendly) baby shower.  During which Jane kept referring to my husband as the Godfather-to-be, which irked me every single time. I guess the month of her being weird just piled on because towards the end, she asked me to take a photo of her and her husband, and then she said, ""Okay now let's get one with both the \*fathers\* to be!"" And I said, very loudly, ""OH COME THE FUCK ON. Are you serious?"" EVERYBODY heard me. I stared at her for a moment, she looked absolutely aghast, and I grabbed my purse and just left. My husband followed me, but in the car, he wouldn't say a word to me. I laid out everything I did in the post including a dozen other examples, but he just stared straight ahead and wouldn't answer. Finally when we got home, he acknowledged that yes, a lot of stuff now that he sees it all laid out, is inappropriate, and he's sorry that he didn't see it and he understands how I feel. But he is absolutely livid that I ""ruined her baby shower"". Jane is furious, never wants to see me again, and John feels this is going to drive a big wedge through his friend group. So was I the asshole here?

173,"AITA For Making My Boyfriend A Better Person, Making Him Intolerable?",1419,Not the A-hole,196,hqe3ty,1594670917.0,"My boyfriend, James(m18) and I(m17) have been together for a bit over a year. We've had extremely different upbringings- my mother is mtf and black, my father is arabic, they are polyamorous and have a shared boyfriend. I am white and adopted. James family is the very typical white collar conservative with lots of money, all white. 

I'm the first guy James has ever had feelings for. He's always been the sweetest guy overall but when we first got together, he said the occasional ignorant statement or joke, especially when we were with his friend group. I let it go for awhile because we have such different backgrounds so it wasn't necessarily his fault but then he said a particularly bad sexist joke with his friends and it pissed me off more than usual. I got up and left without saying anything. 

The next day, I sat him down and essentially told him that he had to work toward being aware of his privilege and not saying bigotry around me anymore or I would break up with him. He didn't really understand at first but over the next couple months, with my help, he got a lot better with it. I don't think I was ever rude about it- he would say something, I would tell him it was wrong, and he would apologize. 

Nowadays, he doesn't say anything bad unless drunk, and even then it's minimal. I've been really proud of him and we're really happy together. Yesterday his friend, ""Mark"", messaged me that I had ""ruined James"". Apparently, James has started calling his friends out when I'm not around and doesn't laugh at their gross jokes anymore. He said that James is a pissy f-slur because of me and his group can't stand him anymore. I told him to fuck himself and blocked him. 

But I do feel really bad now. I had only ever requested James not say that sort of stuff around me specifically and it isn't like his personality is different? He's just a better person, in my opinion, but if his friend group really stop talking to him, I'll feel awful. I'm regretting making him change because it could be said that it's my fault they don't want to be around him anymore. 

Am I the asshole/Was I in the wrong in the first place?

Edit: Wow this got a lot of responses- Thank you so much everyone who has taken the time out of their day and I apologize to everyone I don't respond to, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed.

174,AITA for reporting a professor after I got a bad grade?,1397,Not the A-hole,147,hpfh08,1594522551.0,"TLDR at end. On mobil so apologies.

I took this course and found it was nothing like the syllabus stated and there was zero direction provided by the prof. We bought a textbook and were expected to gain everything from that. This issue alone wasn't huge (mostly annoying considering I am paying to get instruction) and I accepted this is true about a lot of college courses.

In really challenging courses I can pull at least a B (never gotten lower than that). In this course, I received Cs or lower on nearly every assignment with very limited feedback. I received an F on my final paper putting me less than 1% below passing.

I tried to reach out to the prof during the semester but they never responded. I showed up to their office hours and they weren't there. I emailed them letting them know I was coming during their office hours and they finally told me they were not available during office hours listed on the syllabus. I tried to schedule an appointment but the prof stopped responding before it could be arranged.

I spoke with other students and they were having the same problems. I basically accepted I wasn't going to get help and just tried my best. I was upset about my final grade but accepted that I just didn't do well. 

I was curious about my prof's rating and looked them up only to find similar complaints spanning three universities and ten years. 

Eventually my friends pushed me to report and ask for a better grade. As part of the appeal, I had to meet with the prof. I emailed her first with a full description of everything I experienced. She responded with: If you were struggling you should have reached out for help. In the formal meeting the prof immediately stopped me and said: I am not addressing a laundry list of problems. I started getting emotional and admitted how hard I tried to get help and they stated they would not comment on specific issues and were known to respond. I brought up that I was not the only student to experience these problems, prof said nothing. It became me talking about the course and the prof just kind of staring at me and not responding. I said that if there was not going to be any discussion I didn't have anything else to say. Prof said they didn't see how these issues would have impacted my grade. 

AITA? I feel so entitled asking for a grade change and I feel like I just didn't work hard enough. But everytime I look at my transcript it just blows my mind that every prof on campus has graded me as a B+ or higher student except in this one fairly inocuous course. Especially looking to hear from teachers.

TLDR Took a course that had no instruction from professor. I reached out for help and couldn't get in contact, ended up failing. Met with prof as part of grade appeal and was told that my problems with the course didn't relate to my grade.",False,False,2020-07-11 19:55:51

I had a classmate in college who would always complain about his girlfriend saying things like ""she's so stupid!"" ""Damn she's annoying!"" ""I should break up with her soon"" and all sorts of disrespectful stuff like that. One day, I come into class and he's surrounded by classmates and with a pouty-face tells me that SHE broke in with him. At that moment I just couldn't hold it in and simply started laughing. For me it was funny since he was so disrespectful towards her and she beat him to the puch. Quickly, some other student took his defense saying how bad I was for laughing at him and all but I stood my ground thinking he got what he deserved and that he probably wasn't that sad since he was complaining about her so much and thinking of dumping her.

176,AITA for letting my sister buy a house for significantly more than it's value?,1393,Not the A-hole,164,hqhli3,1594683916.0,"This happened awhile ago and we've made up but my sister says this was the most asshole thing I've done to her so here we go:

Before I bought the house I'm in now, I was looking for a house for a period of about 3 years. Last year I managed to find the 'ideal' house for myself. Beautiful house, master bedroom facing east, close to work. Perfect. So I called the agent and put down my offer. I told my family about this but my sister in particular was very interested in the process. Soon later I find out my sister also put down an offer. Bit annoying but whatever. I've been burnt before so this time I chose to call a real estate appraiser to appraise the house. The lady appraised it and told me that it wasn't worth what they're selling it for. I inquired with the agent and I got a very sketchy vibe so I walked away. Just told everyone it was too expensive and left it there. My sister ended up buying it for even more than the original asking price because of another interested buyer but she was still ecstatic over the house and didn't waste time boasting about it. At her 'housewarming party' my dad asked how I feel about losing to my sister and I told him I didn't lose since I wasn't the one who paid nearly $45 000 more than the house is worth (including the amount she added to buff out the guy). Obviously my dad asked me to elaborate so I told him. My sister came in, heard and started yelling at me for letting her waste her money on it. First off, it was a private appraisal and the extra could've been the real estate agency's fee. And she loved the house  so she probably would've bought it for the same price regardless. So, was I the asshole?

Edit: for the confusion, my sister bought the house with (fixed) assistance from our parents to avoid a mortgage. I got the same deal with my house. Their contribution is the same amount for every house ($65 000)",False,1594701056.0,2020-07-13 16:45:16
177,AITA for giving a 'rude' commission?,1373,Not the A-hole,216,hodt7b,1594365807.0,"I (16NB) am autistic, and I established boundaries to one of my mom's friends (30's F), B.

&#x200B;

I never liked B, she's very casual/old fashioned, and thinks to mention any mental health issues is forcing labels on yourself. Her sons are friends of mine, and we get along. One of her stepsons is also autistic, but his symptoms are different. He needs higher support,  and he LOVES hugs/affection. I need less support but am hypersensitive, meaning certain smells, noises, and touch can overwhelm me to having meltdowns.

&#x200B;

She kept touching me (on the shoulder/arm) recently, I told her I didn't want to be touched bc I'm autistic and it makes me uncomfortable. She gave a spiel about how I was forcing labels on myself, how I wasn't autistic because her son likes touch, and then keeps grabbing my arms/touching me/hugging me, while saying 'touch is good! don't be disrespectful!'

&#x200B;

This already pissed me off, but on the Fourth of July, she and her children came over for a few fireworks. I don't remember how we got on the topic but she vs me and her kids got to an argument about some racist behavior of hers. Not a big argument, but mom pulled me aside telling me not to bring up politics, so fine. I went and sat back down and B's apology to me was to, in front of everyone, lean in a centimeter away from my neck and whisper she was sorry, which set off my sensory issues. I told her to back up and she wouldn't. 

&#x200B;

Rewind before this happened, she could tell I don't like her, and bc I like to paint, she said she'd pay me for a painting that showed how I felt abt her. She said it could be whatever I wanted. For a few weeks I just decided that I wouldn't do it, because I didn't wanna waste my time on something for someone who doesn't respect me. But after the Fourth, I decided to get petty.

I basically just wrote (on watercolor paper) 'Please respect my boundaries. Me not being a carbon copy of your 13 y/o son does not revoke my diagnosis. Touching me won't 'desensitize me' only make me distrust you. You are a fully grown woman and I expect you to respect me'

&#x200B;

I put some watercolor in the background just to keep it 'a painting'

She came over this morning, and I gave it to her. I left before she could react and according to my mom, she wouldn't let her see it and put it in her purse. She didn't pay me for giving her the exact thing she asked for either.

&#x200B;

My sister (who has called me the r-word multiple times as a 'joke', abused me my whole childhood) said it was very rude and jumped to defending B's actions instead of trying to understand my side. She said I should have had her read it first but I said Exactly what I meant to and anything 'nicer' would have been not holding her accountable. I didn't insult her, I asked for her to respect me and educated her on her ignorance. My sister yelled at me about how rude I was.

&#x200B;

Mom is on my side but says that the line mentioning her son was 'too much', but I felt I made the point as kindly as I could.

My wife (31F) (fake name) Sherry, has been best friends with (fake name) Amanda (31F) since they were in highschool. Sherry considers Amanda ‚Äúthe sister she never had‚Äù ( Sherry has a very complicated family dynamic that Amanda helped her with ). 

Sherry and I met and started dating in college, she‚Äôs the love of my life, she‚Äôs beautiful, kind, caring, and intelligent. We are in the process of trying for a baby (which sparked this conflict). Amanda never liked me all that much, I don‚Äôt know why, she was always very cold to me, but my wife always said she was ‚Äújust protective of her‚Äù.  

Amanda is also a total rich snob, her dad is some big shot at a tech company, so she lives lavishly even though she‚Äôs just a assistant professor. She got her degrees from Ivy‚Äôs (which she always brings up when we get into arguments about politics...), always wears super expensive stuff, and gifts my wife luxurious things. For example, she took my wife on a two week trip to Paris for her 30th birthday....which is very generous of her, but Paris is for couples, and I think it was rude of her to not extend the offer to me, because we‚Äôre married.  For my 30th birthday, she gave me a bottle of 30 year aged whiskey...which was nice but Paris????

Anyways, Amanda and Sherry were talking about baby stuff, and they started talking about the cost of children, like college fund, extracurriculars, etc. I popped in and joked ‚ÄúHow much are you putting into the baby‚Äôs college fund since you‚Äôre acting like the third parent Amanda?‚Äù and she just laughed it off, which made me kinda pissed, because I think that since she‚Äôs always calling herself auntie and inserting herself into our business, acting like a parent, she should contribute since she‚Äôs completely capable of it....
So I pushed it a little, and she completely overreacted and said ‚ÄúWeird how you always rail at me for being raised as a spoiled princess, but you were the one who grew up to be an entitled prick.‚Äù which is COMPLTELY unacceptable and incredibly rude.  I told her to get out and never come back and that if she wasn‚Äôt going to contribute to my child‚Äôs future, she didn‚Äôt need to be a part of it. I think Sherry needs to cut her off, we‚Äôre husband and wife first, and Amanda has been completely disrespectful to me, but Sherry disagrees and thinks IM the asshole because she needs Amanda in her life as a friend. I think I need to come first as her husband and that Amanda needs to stay the fuck away from our lives now. What do you think reddit",False,False,2020-07-12 00:26:18

I'm in a group of friends. There are 5 of us, me, my DH, my friend ‚ÄúPaul‚Äù his fiance ‚ÄúJane‚Äù and our mutual friend ‚ÄúRose.‚Äù

Paul, Rose and I have known each other close to a decade. DH and I have been together 6 years, married 4. Paul and Jane have been together for just under 2 years. Despite us trying to be closer friends, Jane isn‚Äôt close to either Rose or I.  Rose and I reached out and tried to include her in our girl nights, and to try and get to know her a bit better, but she didn‚Äôt seem interested. We include her and talk to her when we get together as a group, but other then that, we don‚Äôt have much to do with her. We don‚Äôt dislike her, but she just didn‚Äôt seem to want to be friends.

In May, Paul and Jane announced that they‚Äôre expecting and we congratulated them, then Jane made a group texting chat with just us three girls. Ever since she started the group chat with Rose and I, all she does is bitch about the pregnancy, from ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôve gained half a pound. OMG awful.‚Äù to ‚ÄúI hate being pregnant ya‚Äôll, make sure your birth control is up to date.‚Äù

At first, I tried to sympathize. Pregnancy can‚Äôt be easy to deal with on a good day, but I imagine it‚Äôs worse in a pandemic. DH and I are dealing with Male infertility, so it was a little difficult, but I really tried, but I finally had to stop, because reading the complaints hurt too much.

The other day, Paul texted me privately and asked if everything was okay, citing that I‚Äôd been pretty quiet in the group chat that included him and DH as well.

I tried to be vague about it, but several texts later, I finally sent him screenshots of the stuff Jane had said about the pregnancy. I then told him that I didn‚Äôt think she actually meant any of that stuff, but as a woman who wanted kids and didn‚Äôt have them, it just hurt too much. I admit, I got a bit heated, and said that if she disliked the pregnancy so much she should have done better at using birth control.

A couple hours later, I got a text from Jane calling me a bunch of names for telling Paul what she‚Äôd said and called me an asshole and saying that ""Your parents should have used birth control"" and ""she didn't mean that stuff, I was just venting.""

Hunting, my husband likes hunting , son does not, and they even have more fights about how my husband ""forces"" him to like it.

But for some reason our son was very quiet and sad for a few dags, wouldn't tell me why.

Anyway I did tell him to put it back, but he told me it wouldn't hurt to see anything that would explain his behaviour. I was curious and worried so I let him.

Not going to say what we found out, but it was really big and understandble why our son was sad, so I told my husband not to say anything to him.

Well he didn't listen, and tried to help our son yesterday to deal with and, and he went ballistic. Told us that we shouldn't have done that, called us horrible parents, took it, and now he's treating us like strangers, and isn't the same again. And for the first time in a long time, he has been mad at me for longer than 2 days, no matter what I do.

Edit- We only read the first 20 pages from the last entry. Nothing else.

Edit- Why is my husband the asshole for trying to bond with my son???? It's not his fault they have fights about it, my husband just tried to spend time with him.

Edit- For people saying that my husband should find out what my son likes, he tries but my son doesn't want to spend time with my husband mostly and makes excuses for it and then that even leads to arguments. Then my son just doesn't tell my husband anything.

Edit- My son does not refer to my husband as ""dad"" or anything else. Either his real name or just some ""Hey"" And yes , I didn't want to go into this, my husband is the step-dad since my son's actual father died 7 years ago

Edit- For all you guys mentioning therapy, when my son was 10, we did do it, he didn't want it, completely ignored the therapist, complained that there's nothing wrong with him, and I took him out since it was obvious that it wasn't helping.

The other day I was getting ready for bed, brushing my teeth, taking a shower ect. She knocks on the bathroom door and says she needs to use the bathroom. I was about to get in the shower and ask if she can wait a few minutes and she says it's fine. I take pretty quick showers so figured it would be okay. I start my shower and after a few minutes she knocks again saying she needs to use the bathroom. I say I'll still be a few more minutes and she says she really needs to go but I still have soap in my hair and need to wash it out. She keeps knocking and I'm getting kind of annoyed at this point so I just ignore her. I finish my shower, shave and brush my teeth. When I open the door she was stading by the door frame and pissing everywhere. I realize it's partially my fault and offer to help her clean the floor but she's really embarrassed and walks away to clean up. When my roommate learns about what happened he gets super upset at me for not stopping everything that I'm doing to let her in. I apologize to his gf and she seems to be fine, really embarrassed but not mad. My roommate is still really angry at me. I feel like a grown woman shouldn't be pissing all over the floor, she could have found some other option if she was THAT desperate and I didn't say anything to her to make her feel bad but roommate is still mad at me.

EDIT: Her and I are completely cool. The conflict was with her bf and me not between her and me. I've apologized and she said it was okay but her bf even at one point said I was committing domestic abuse against her when all that happened was she pissed all over the floor. Her bf is still making this an issue even though she herself says it was fine. I meant to say am I the asshole or is her bf?

INFO: A lot of people are asking why I shaved and brushed my teeth. She stopped knocking at that point so I figured she had found some other option or gone away. 

A lot of people are also asking what other options she has, we have some disposable plastic cups and if she was that desperate she could of peed in one of the cups and thrown it away. It's gross but sounds like she needed it super bad.

She doesn't have any medical conditions or incontinence issues but she was on a zoom meeting and apparently couldn't excuse herself for a minute so she had been holding it already for a bit.

I kept the door locked because she would try to kick me out before I was finished. She also got piss all over my feet but I didn't say anything about it

The agreement was for a couple weeks until she found a place to live. I agreed bc i had the room to spare and i genuinely like helping people. 

Since she has been here she leaves ALL the lights on. Any room she goes in the light remains on, sometime overnight. I've talked to her about it on several occasions. Each time she apologizes and says it wont happen again, yet it continues. She uses the pool at her leisure, has never offered to help clean it or buy chemicals. 

I went on vacation and her and her mother got mad that i had another friend house sit and watch my dog because and they said , and i quote ""we thought we had the house to ourselves for a few more days"". They were over heard saying how ""i should had asked them before i let my friend stay there"", this set me off in itself bc thats my house, i dont have to ask anyone permission for shit at my house. 

I talked to D this past sunday and asked her when she would be out bc its been almost 2 months now. She says monday, then chages it to tuesday. Then by the time we are done talking she changes it to Wednesday.  Finally i say Wednesday is final.  

Now today while i am at work my other friend (31f), we will call her M, she stopped by my house to check on things (as i have asked her to do bc i have a gut feeling telling me D is dodging me as i havent seen her since sunday when i had that talk with her).

Now her mom is sending me nasty messages on how M is just trying to start trouble and how I am in the wrong and an asshole for making her leave tonight. AITA?


Update: her parents are currently here helping her pack her belongings. I was out back by the pool, they didn't speak to me, even after i greeted them hello. I was very sincere i might add.


Update #2: She told me she had to work at 5pm to close and would come get her things when she got off work at 1am. I have changed the locks and informed her she can come for the rest of her things tomorrow while I'm home. Thank you to everyone and their affirmation that i am NTA and did the right thing.


Update #3 (hopefully the last): her mom sent me more nasty txts this am. Telling me im petty and acting like I'm in HS. I told her not to confuse petty with not putting up with D's childish behavior. I told her to have a nice life and blocked her. D still has a few things in my basement that she is suppose to get today, should i place them outside for her under the deck?

185,AITA for breastfeeding in front of my kids?,1240,Not the A-hole,411,hp1iog,1594460081.0,"On mobile.

I'm currently breastfeeding my month old daughter. I do it wherever I happen to be in the house but mainly in my chair in the living room. Before my daughter was even born, I had chats with my 6 year old son and almost 4 year old step daughter. I explained what breasts were, what they're for, why daughter would be sucking and eating from them, how it's natural and not shameful, and it isn't something for them to stare at and make a huge deal out of. I had to have several repeat conversations with step daughter because she would stare and seemed to make a big deal of it. I answered all questions she had and I thought all was well.

Today my fiance came to me and told me I need to breastfeed in our bedroom only. I told him it wasn't happening. He then told me his daughter tried breastfeeding on her mother and her mom is now throwing a fit because I do it in front of her daughter. AITA if I refuse to breastfeed in the bedroom? It leaves the kids mostly to their own devices. They wouldn't have someone to talk to, feed them, play with them, supervise them, etc.",False,False,2020-07-11 02:34:41

About 8 years ago, my husband developed a cough. He went to multiple doctors but nobody could find anything wrong. He describes it as a ""tickle in his throat.""

I can hear his coughing in all rooms of the house, regardless of where he's located. He coughs morning to night and I've counted upwards of 30 coughs in 5 minutes. At night it's worse. Sometimes every 7-10 seconds. He's been working from home and is a homebody, plus we have two small kids, so it's difficult for me to get away.

Every time I mentioned his cough in the past, he got super angry with me so I haven't said a word about it for years. I've tried my best to not let it affect our relationship or make him feel bad about it.

Fast forward to today when he became angry with me. He asked why I don't like spending extended periods of time with him anymore. I told him it's because of his non stop coughing, and he blew up at me. He said ""well I'm sorry I'm such an annoying person."" I said ""you're not an annoying person, it's just the cough that's annoying."" He said ""why don't you just ignore it?"" I told him that I've ignored it for years! Or at least tried! I told him that I understood it wasn't his fault for having a cough, but it's also not my fault for being annoyed with it after 8 years of almost non-stop coughing. I said that at this point I feel like his cough might be a habit. He refused to speak with me after that and has been treating me badly ever since.

AITA? I didn't think I was but now I'm wondering if maybe I'm horrible for even being bugged by it.

Edit: Wow you guys! I'm absolutely blown away with all the help I've received! I've created a list of things we will check into one by one. I've discussed it with my husband and he's agreed to go back to the doctor so we can get this figured out. Again, thank you so much. I wish I'd posted sooner.

For those of you calling me AH, I totally understand why. I apologized to him for being insensitive and gave him an hour massage to make up for being a jerk. He seems happier now.",False,1594574806.0,2020-07-11 23:03:00

No surprise there, he loves camping and we just went as a family at the end of May. What \*was\* surprising was when he said he wanted it to be a ""boys trip"" this time, including him, his best friend, his dad, and our three sons (9, 13, and 15). The problem is, we have a 17 year old daughter as well. She's as much of an outdoorsperson(?) as her dad, and significantly more interested in camping and fishing than the 13-year-old anyway. I feel like my husband is excluding her for absolutely no reason, gendering a trip that doesn't need to be gendered. It makes me really uncomfortable and I don't care for it. At the same time, I don't know if my daughter even \*wants\* to go and be the only girl going, so I suggested to my husband he take his mom or sister at least and then he got kinda pissy and said the trip was getting ""too big"" again...when we last went camping, it was over a dozen of us and it was hectic and stressful as hell. I didn't have a great time anyway and would much rather stay home myself (which I'm fine with, I'll get me time!) But I don't want to bring it up to my daughter and let her know her dad had been planning to leave her out altogether. I know his intention wasn't to hurt her or exclude her for the hell of it, for whatever reason he wants a ""boys trip""...I said that was wrong, and if he's going to take 3/4 of our children, it's wrong to exclude the fourth just for being a girl. I can tell he's conflicted now and is rethinking the whole trip, but he already told his best friend and father about it...he was really excited and now seems rather downtrodden about the whole thing.  


I feel like I may have ruined something that might not have even been a problem to begin with. It definitely is to me, but I know plenty of people have done ""boys trips""...do they do it if they're taking most of the family and just leaving out a daughter? I mean, if this was an alternate universe where I had three daughters and one son instead, I would never plan a ""girls"" trip and just leave my son behind...AITA?",False,False,2020-07-11 18:29:09

We are both n long term relationships, no kids. When we first started working together ago we beca,e pretty good friends pretty fast, but there is one thing that puts me off her. This centres around a surgeon at our hospital, Dr. Lee. He has three kids.

We make small talk sometimes when we end up working together and have the time and he often talks about his kids. It‚Äôs just regular dad talk, I wouldn‚Äôt say he brings it up every time but it is quite often.

For example, he would tell us his son won a soccer tournament or had a funny story at practice or something. Like there are legitimately funny or interesting stories, it‚Äôs just about his kids. Sometimes he does tend to ramble on a bit but no one else minds. It‚Äôs honestly all really sweet to me. But Amy says stuff like ‚ÄúNo one cares about his kids stupid soccer game‚Äù or go off about how a high school game doesn‚Äôt mean anything, it‚Äôs not like he won the world cup. You know, stuff like that. She gets irrationally angry, but never to his face. It‚Äôs not even annoying to anyone else, honestly his kids are kind of crackheads and really entertaining.

Maybe she didn‚Äôt pay attention but the kids are actually way older than she thought they were. She always makes a point to say that it‚Äôs ridiculous to baby them at their age. I may be getting old but once you‚Äôre almost thirty teenagers start feeling like babies to you. Besides, he‚Äôs just showing normal parental behaviour, he‚Äôs not doing everything for them. He works insanely long hours, so I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt actually get to spend that much time with them. I‚Äôd rather deal with a hundred dads like this than the usually deadbeat or emotionally unavailable ones. None of my other coworkers, from all ages, genders, and walks of life have a problem with him.

It‚Äôs gotten worse now, a lot of elective surgeries have been cancelled so he has more free time to spend with his kids. That means marginally more kid talk for us. Amy is so annoyed by this, it‚Äôs almost funny. Even things that she normally has interest in, like Marvel movies, she gets pissed at when he mentions because it‚Äôs the kids. Like, I get the childfree lifestyle, I also don‚Äôt have kids, but people will talk about topics that aren‚Äôt interesting to you in life. You have to learn to suck it up. And if she paid attention, she would see the interests they share or the interesting stories. I can‚Äôt share them because they‚Äôre so unique it would definitely identify them.

There have been multiple times now where one of my children have gone up to her, trying to show her something or asking to watch a television show with her or something along those lines, and she just rebuffs them. For an example, my ten year old is very interested in cooking, and so is my girlfriend, so I brought up to them that maybe they could try watching a cooking show together or trying to cook something simple. Her response? ""He's too young to be into cooking."" 

 My youngest is very hyperactive and has some learning issues. Recently, I taught him how to read a page in his favorite book and he tried to show my girlfriend because he was really proud of it. She refused to look at it and said ""I don't want to see your stupid book."" 

A week ago, I took her aside and said that she wasn't attempting to make a connection with any of them, and we cannot move foward in our relationship if they didn't have a friendship of some sort.

Last night she was getting ready to go to dinner with her husband. She was wearing a dress, I don't really know how to describe it but it was lace and then faded to being backless, so you could see the sides of her breast a little.

I am a 19 year old female, Just got my Military contract a year ago and have just been kinda bouncing around for a while. My Great Uncle was a 76 year old man and is the greatest man to ever live. 

So Apparently. My uncle has been sick for a while but didn't tell anyone, He had cancer and instead of treatment wanted to ride it out like a G. 

I never knew this and just kept visiting him since I knew he was older and helped him out when I wasn't working. Cleaning up his house, Taking the dogs to the vet and other simple stuff when I had time or would pay for services. 

He died peacefully in his sleep. But when they read the will, he made me the sole inheritancer of everything. His inheritance is worth well over 5.4 Mil not including the houses that are now in my name, I honestly didn't even know he was wealthy at all since he just lived in this sort of dirt trailer in the middle of nowhere. 

He has 6 kids that are all grown up and his wife (my aunt) died two years ago. He wrote a letter with his will and while I won't type out most of it, pretty much ripping down his kids and called them Money Hungry bastards that didn't deserve the dog shit in his yard and called his only daughter (My cousin) a ""-horse faced whore that has children pretty much marching out her legs as much as guys go into them."" Along with so so many more insults that made the lawyer blush. 

So I inherited everything and planning his funeral which is just cremation and dumping his ashes I'm the rocky mountains. But his kids (My cousins) are threatening to sue me for the money and his estate and saying they deserve it cause they are his kids. But he specifically said not to give them shit, Or even let them take his stuff. And all the kids lived on his properties as well, And he's evicted them all so they have 30 days to leave their homes.

Have been threatening My boyfriend (who has been staying out of this) saying that he should 'Correct his Woman' or that they will come over and steal stuff from his house (the valuable stuff of course like his giant TV and Jewelry)

While the sister has been calling me non stop saying that I better give her something cause she has 8 Kids (All little shit heads) and deserves it more since she was Banking on her Dad's money to help her with Money.

They where even excited when we went in to read the will, Like they had just won the lottery and I was the only one sad he is actually gone!

I'm legit pissed and Everything. Those dumb asses are going to actually try to take me to court with the 3 braincells they share.

If I'm honest, I don't even want anything. I didn't want anything to begin with, I was only there cause I'm in charge of his Funeral. I was originally going to see if I could split it with them But cause of the way they are all acting, I don't know if I want to.

195,AITA For interacting occasionally with my husband with a stranger sitting between us on a plane?,1093,Not the A-hole,347,hogrxp,1594376975.0,"Just got off a long haul flight (11+ hours) where this situation happened. 

Husband and I recently used airline credit to rebook a flight that was cancelled earlier this year. The process for that was basically, the airline agency took the credits we had and booked our flight for us. We didn't even get a confirmation email. 


So really really, we  had absolutely **no** say on our seats. We tried to change them when checking in, but were told it was too late and the plane was full. 

When we boarded, we politely asked if the guy in the middle of us would mind taking the aisle instead of his middle seat. He refused and said he wanted the window. I really, really strongly prefer window seats for a variety of reasons,  so I said, still as kindly as possible, that the window wasn't an option, I sleep a lot and don't pee a lot, so it was the aisle or just deal with being between us. He said he would only take the window and seemed surprised when I said fine, stay in the middle then. 

While we considered being annoying on purpose, we really didn't. Twice I asked my husband for something from his bag. We had a few five minute or less exchanges, usually to discuss something relevant. We watched the same movie so tended to laugh at the same time. He showed me a picture without either of us leaning across the guy. He gave me part of his food he didn't want to eat. And of course twice I got up to stretch/bathroom. 

The guy got progressively more annoyed and accused us of trying to game the system and being annoying and that we were trying to force his hand. He called a flight attendant twice and she told him to suck it up... twice. 

My husband suggested he find someone willing to trade because we weren't being any more obnoxious than if we were sitting together barring passing things across him three times total (ONLY when he wasn't doing something on the tray, and once while he was literally asleep). He complained for the rest of the flight and at the baggage claim. 


I think we weren't being excessive at all and if we could have, we would have bought seats together. But obviously the guy didagreed. AI(were we) the assholes?

**EDIT:** Just to be clear, my husband and I don't really care about sitting together. Had we been in different rows we probably wouldn't have even asked anyone to switch. 

It's not that we were trying to force him to do what we want, it's just that I value sitting next to a window more than next to my husband. We couldn't have spent more than 15 or so minutes total interacting in the 11+ hours and even that seems like more than we did since most of our interactions were just quick handoffs, and half of them were while he was sleeping and without disturbing his sleep.


**Also** many have asked, the main reason I want/need the window is anxiety related. Without getting too much into it, sitting next to a window is more important to me than pretty much anything else on a plane.",False,1594353501.0,2020-07-10 03:29:35

They broke up because he picked a career my sister didn't approve of (bouncer/guard) over the relationship.

My sister recently lost a baby with her partner of 7 months. She's devasted, depressed and upset and she keeps making digs about me and my baby. She says I'm selfish for getting with her ex and my baby was born out of spite because God knew her baby was going to die and this is some sick form of torture for her... I've cried so many times that it's unreal. I know she's hurting and she's really mad in the fit of rage and upset when she says these things... But still, it hurts.

Lately, she's been acting kinder to me and wants to see my baby but part of me is scared of her. Is that weird? She's been having mini breakdowns constantly since the death of the baby and family have been telling me that my sister is extremely jealous of me and she thinks its selfish that the father of the baby is her ex. I even saw texts of my sister saying she wants her ex back and she wants to have a baby with him so that she isn't left out...

I feel really weird and uncomfortable, and I don't know what my sister has planned up her sleeve. I don't know what her intentions are with my baby or with my partner. I'm just scared of her right now, but she keeps insisting on visiting me and the baby because we're family and that my parents want us to get along.

I've ignored her and she's finally mentioned it to my family.

M also mentioned that she could show off my work on her Instagram (M does some modelling so has a following of ~10k) and see if I can get some commissions. Quarantine has made me broke so this is an amazing opportunity. So, I gave her this shirt. Honestly, it suited her aesthetic so much and she looked so cute in it. I'm glad I gave it to M. 

M posted pictures of her modelling the shirt, tagging me in the post and thanking me for it. It got a lot of attention and I tagged in a few comments commending my work. However, F wasn't happy with me and sent me and angry DM calling me a backstabbing bitch and that my work is shit so I don't deserve the positive attention I'm getting. She told me that it was ridiculous that I'd do work for free for M and not for her.

I blocked F and she's been kicked out of our friend group's chat. The group agrees that F was out of line and that the name calling was horrible but a few people have said that maybe I shouldn't have given M the shirt as it was just a double standard and that I need to think that maybe F just feel left out and it's caused her to lash out

So, AITA?

Edit: grammar

Edit 2: Wow thanks guys for all the feedback! Some people have been asking for pictures and they'll be coming soon! I just need to figure out imgur. I'll post the shirt I gave to M and a project I'm working on for a commission :)

Some people have been mentioning that it's obvious I'm NTA. I posted this because I was genuinely worried I may have gone too far and upset F. I struggle with empathy and understanding people's emotions and my friends, when we spoke about this situation, asked me to try step into the shoes of F and see how she might feel, that she might feel embarrassed and hurt by me.

Edit 3: omg this has blown up so much. I think I need to clarify two things:
1) We're all 17, we're teenagers. I appreciate the comments that I was undercharging F and that ¬£15 is too little, however we all don't have that much money lying around. We've all been fired from our jobs due to the pandemic as well so we've all spent our last paycheck and have gone back to asking our parents for money. I was just catering to F's price range as I still wanted a sale
2) The shirt I gave M wasn't just for exposure. It was mainly a gift actually. I can't really afford to give people gifts a lot of the time and M's birthday had just passed and I had only just got her a card. This shirt was kinda a late birthday present. She suggested that she'd shout me out to get my work some attention and of course I agreed!

Also, here is my work!

200,AITA for not letting the neighbor's kids see the cat I adopted from their family?,1064,Not the A-hole,260,hqxvvy,1594744750.0,"I have a tense relationship with my neighbor, with the grandmother actually. She is in her mid 50s(probably) - loud, overbearing, loves to gossip and very nosey. I once had a fight with her and since then everyone in the neighbourhood knows that we are tense.


They used to own a cat and it was free to roam. As a fellow cat owner whose cats are strictly indoors sometimes I worry for its safety because there is a dog park nearby and ofcourse, cars and sadistic kids too(another neighbor, another story).


Their cat returned home bloody one day, a whole patch of skin around its back leg came off(let's excuse the details). The treatment for it was a good few thousands and the family had been actively looking for donations in the community. Days passed and they were still asking for donations. 


I felt sorry for the poor cat and offered to pay everything under the condition that they give up their cat to me. I am no saint you see and you can call me possessive, but for me to spend so much money the cat has to be mine. They agreed.


The cat made a full recovery within a month, and the cost for its health was... a little painful for my wallet but manageable. The 3 kids(age 5-11) of that family used to come my house to visit the cat 1-2 times a week, and they've started to make a habit of it. The kids were well behaved and the cat still loves them yes, but I am not very comfortable to have them coming to my house as a routine.


I said nothing till the kids started to beg for me to return the cat to them, and after that, their parents and grandparents showed up and said the same. They offered to return me the money slowly but the cat is mine now, I love it, it is safe as an indoor cat with me and I have no intention of giving it back. I had to draw a line, set boundaries.


I announced to the family that I won't be opening for visits to see my cat anymore. Shit breaks shortly afterwards as I got crying kids at my gate, angry calls from the parents and angry grandma telling the whole neighbourhood how much of a AH I am, denying family from their member and making little kids cry. 


AITA? So sick of this shit but not about to change my mind, just wanting see which side of morality I am in.


Edit to add: Many people seems to be assuming that I did this to intentionally shit on the family. To be completely honest, I'd be lying to say that it was nothing personal, but thats not the whole reason.


On one hand, the cat's health had been deteriorating without treatment as they uploaded more pictures/videos of its injuries and as time went by. For someone who like cats and have seen it around for some time it hurts my heart to see it in pain and probably dying.


On the other hand, its true that I really don't like the grandmother and by extension, the whole family, except the kids. Even if I wanted to help, it doesn't sit well with me to just donate the whole lump sum to them and assume that they would treat the cat, like I said I am no saint. 


The only reasonable way to help the cat then was to adopt and accept it as my own. The idea that I am helping my own cat makes it my business and I would do anything to help my cat and make sure it gets well. Also it would me that I don't have to give anything to that family. 


I know that the kids love the cat very much and they cried when the family gave them to me, so I let them in to see the cat when they ask to. They are very well behaved, keeping their voice low and would leave me and my other cats alone so that they don't startle them. While it made me uncomfortable when it became a routine as long as they stay well behaved and my partner don't mind I am okay with letting them see the cat as it gradually gets back to health.


And then now they're asking for it back. I know, kids love that cat and now that its back to its old healthy and playful self, they want it home. My partner was able to talk to them nicely(not me, bad with kids) but later on their parents also butt in and wanted the cat back. It just seems so ridiculous that even the adults behave that way. The cat is mine, and I love it as much as my other cats, especially after seeing it recovering so well, a sense of achievement and pride. There is just no reason for me to give them the cat, even if they were able to pay me back.


The problem now is that I've set the boundaries too late it seems. The grandmother had been bashing me online and offline saying that I am holding her cat hostage and hurting her grandkids, giving them false hope deliberately because of old grudges and shit like that. She talks bad about my partner too who had nothing to do with it. The parents are also begging/threatening me to have the cat back and the children cried at my gate when I refused to let them in. This is a complete mess. All I hope now is that this would come to a pass after some time.


Despite all that though, I'm glad to have the cat healthy and mine.",False,1594741159.0,2020-07-14 09:39:10
201,AITA for effectively killing my relationship with my sister for 2$/hr?,1058,Not the A-hole,187,hogx0s,1594377530.0,"To preface: my boyfriend and my parents have basically said ESH, I'm less of an ass than she is but we're still assholes


Me: 21M, Sister: 32F

So my sister has an infant whos 5 months old. She had asked me to help her watch him to which I've said yes. Prior to this, I didn't apply to any fast food jobs to which I've have 5 years of experience this as I didn't want to risk exposing myself and passing it on to the baby. I drove 3 hours (in total) every day to her place and back, and stayed for 8 hours every day, 3 times a week. I'd like to say I did it pretty well, as they were amazed by how quickly I was able to put him to sleep. 

The main reason they need me is because they're both busy with work. They generally have multiple conference calls a day, and as a result need someone to take care of the fussing baby to not interrupt their call. While they were preoccupied, if my nephew was fussing, I would immediately calm him down, taking him into another room if necessary to make sure their work lives weren't disturbed. During my time there, payment was never discussed. Admittedly, I should've brought it up myself but I didn't feel comfortable due to me seeing her as an actual ""adult.""

Fast forward to Monday, I asked her if she could pay me. I said minimum (15). We later had a conversation and she basically said she'd discuss it further with her husband. I let her know that I also applied to McDonalds, and I would assist her during her transition to a real nanny should things not pan out between us. On Wes, she said she would offer me 10. I said I thought I deserved 12 to which she completely disagreed. Her reasoning: nannies that are paid 15 also provide laundry, cleaning, cooking, sanitizing bottles, etc. She felt 10 was a better reflection of what I do. I said my flexibility, safety (health wise), and care of her nephew warranted the extra 2. In addition, she and her husband are both very successful so I know very much so that she can afford it. She disagreed so I said sure, you can find a new nanny and I can go work at mcd. She was incredibly upset when I said that. 

We then had a large argument where she screamed at me and said I backstabbed her and how I never cared about her or her family and how I was ruining everything for 2/hr. Again, at this point, I was still willing to help her until she found a new nanny. I then rebutted by saying she was choosing to ruin this, again, over 2/hr. I then asked her if she wanted me to come the next day to which she angrily yelled no at which point I left. She then sent me a bunch of angry texts on my long commute home and we also had a phone call where she called me a liar for applying to mcd for leverage for more money and said I had no empathy and what not. I have no intention on helping her further but my parents are asking me to be the bigger person to protect my nephew's health and also because I'm great with him. I said no, unless she specifically asked for me to come and gave me the extra pay. AITA here?

Edit: thank you to everyone for your thoughts. I completely agree that I was a dumbass for not bringing this up earlier. I was also a dumbass for helping her in the first place. In hindsight,i can't believe I drove 3 hrs in traffic for that long. It's suffice to say I know my worth now and certainly won't be taken advantage of anymore.

202,AITA for helping my (soon ex) brother-in-law against my own sister in their child custody case?,1025,Not the A-hole,85,hqmox0,1594699643.0,"So my sister Sara (27) was married to a sailor (merchant marine) who was away on a ship for months a time. They got a 2 years old daughter. To save money when husband was away she was living with me 33/f and my husband.

But problem was our brother Jack (25). Him and Sara were always wild (before she married) and every time Sara husband gone to sea they would both go party crazy. It was always Jack who was bugging her and leading, despite being older she always followed his lead. Jack excuse was that her husband is sailor and he got girl in every port and she deserve to have fun as well.

So basically it was me who cared for her kid while she and Jack would go crazy. Half a nights she didn't even come home and would (i assume) sleep in Jack apartment. One time they when they didn't respond my calls and i was super worried and gone to Jack apartment (i got spare key) and when i came in he was sleeping naked with some girl on a couch, alcohol everywhere and our sister was in his room all messed up.

Long story short, my brother-law-buddies and sister told him whats happening and he asked for divorce. He also had confrontation with Jack and as my husband told me (who was present) Jack was openly mocking him and whispered something to his ear with my brother-in-law going berserk and called them both ""sick fucks"". 

Despite she being my sister, she is just immature and irresponsible and not fit to raise a child and despite my husband protests i told my now soon ex brother-in-law that i gonna help him with child custody case.

Since quarantine, I‚Äôve gained quite a bit of weight. They offered to help me, and when I was discussing a plan, I said my weight was a certain number, even though it was somewhat over that. I‚Äôm absolutely ashamed with myself; saying the number makes it worse. SM is not the friendliest of motivators and has been known to call me out/shame me in the past. 

We hashed out a plan, but, last night, my dad was attempting to tempt me into eating outside of the diet plan SM and I worked out. I was very tired and angry (he frequently calls to me/orders me to do things like a dog, and I was fed up) and told him to stop undermining my progress. I also (accidentally; I was mad and opened my big fat mouth) told him I‚Äôd need to work harder because I ‚Äúlied about my weight.‚Äù I immediately told him that I wanted that to stay between us.

This morning, I was on a walk with SM, and she was discussing how I felt and telling me that she was thinner than me and gained weight because of kids and she had to work it off, and that because I‚Äôm ‚Äúheavier‚Äù than she was, I‚Äôll have to work harder. Then, she dropped the bomb that my dad had told her about my lie.

This isn‚Äôt the first, second, or tenth time my dad has spilled secrets to SM. I didn‚Äôt find out about it until a while ago, which is one of the big reasons why I stopped talking to him.

I've been with my GF for 3 years and he's been with his for 4 years.

* He's suddenly gone very lethargic very quickly. He'll get up, sit on his chair for about an hour and be that tired that he'll sleep for another 3 or 4 hours but will still be awake all night long. I've suggested for him to go on walks as simple but effective exercise that will tire him out so he'll sleep at least 6 to 8 hours at night. He declines because he's tired
* He's stopped eating. This concerned me, he says that it's because he has zero appetite. I tried to make sure he was eating right when I first noticed this back around last December time. He has obviously thinned out beyond belief (you can see an uncomfortable number of bones). I also believe that this might be why he's tired all day
* He drinks literally all the liquid I buy from my food shop and then some. Like, he'll say he's that thirsty and has a really dry throat when he drinks a two litre bottle of Coke in literally two or three attempts. A literal sip for him is essentially drinking a full pint
* He complains about having to go toilet more often. I told him that this was because of the amount that he drinks. We had to stop twice when I was in the car with him the other day, the distance wasn't even two miles

Out of curiosity she kept asking for details and kinda found out she's not too old (late 40s) and would be easily a top 10% content creator. Now she's determined to have an account too...

She'll always call someone to change her TV channel, give her (free) drives despite having a license, do ATM withdrawals, fill her taxes, doing more than calls on her 15yo dumb phone is sci-fi etc. I've tried to teach her many times and the result is always 'one ear in, one ear out' and 'just do it instead of me, you know it better'. If I refuse, I'm always met with a 'buuut I doooon't knooow hooow, you're a horrible son' tantrum. I just gave up and for example set her alarm because it's faster than wasting time for teaching stuff that won't be remembered.

Now the AITA part - she knows I own an 'expensive' camera (Canon 80D) and asked me to set up an account and make content for her. I was like 'eww, no way I'll take nudes and masturbation videos of my mom, what's wrong with you?' and was met with a tantrum like always. Now she refuses to talk with me and if she does, it's always about me being a horrible son for depriving her of a possibility for early retirement.

She told me she doesn't find it comfortable for me to have a painting of her since we're broken up, and said I had to either give it to her or destroy it.

To me, it's not about *her.* I don't want to give up the painting, and it's not even about the money. Rather, there's a certain satisfaction is making something with your own hands. It's your creation, so giving it to someone else feels wrong. As for destroying it, I don't think it needs to be explained why I'd object to destroying art, especially art I put lots of work into.

211,AITA for leaving our daughter alone with my MIL who used to bully my wife?,890,Asshole,258,hpzqp5,1594608855.0,"If it matters, my wife (38F) and I (34M) have been together for 11 years and married for 7. This was in November but my wife and I still disagree if I was the AH. I‚Äôm willing to accept I was an AH. 

Very briefly, my MIL bullied my wife in youth about her weight and as a result she‚Äôs very self conscious. It‚Äôs always been my wife‚Äôs decision how much MIL is in our lives, I‚Äôve backed her in every situation. Just to make it clear it‚Äôs her choice to keep MIL in her life, no one is forcing her. MIL lives on the other side of the world so we have limited contact anyway and we‚Äôve put firm boundaries in place regarding our daughter (then 4) which so far she‚Äôs respected. 

We didn‚Äôt tell MIL about our pregnancy until our daughter was born because we were concerned she‚Äôd increase this bullying behaviour due to my wife‚Äôs pregnancy weight gain and may begin it with our daughter. Four years later this has never been an issue with our daughter and MIL has stopped the body shaming remarks towards my wife. Whilst she‚Äôs never apologised to my wife, she has changed her behaviour and they‚Äôve began to have a happier relationship.

MIL was visiting for a week (not staying with us overnight) and this day was day 5. It was all going well so far. My wife was working that day where I wasn‚Äôt so it was us two and daughter at our house. We‚Äôd ran out of milk so MIL agreed to watch daughter whilst I nipped to the corner shop. (She couldn‚Äôt go because she doesn‚Äôt have car insurance to drive here and it was throwing it down so walking wouldn‚Äôt have been pleasant.) I was gone for a MAXIMUM of 15 minutes. 

When I arrived home daughter ran to me in tears. MIL had called her fat (I‚Äôm a nurse - she isn‚Äôt) and said some other body shaming comments. I told MIL to leave and after a little protesting she did. According to our daughter this is the first time MIL has made such comments. It‚Äôs also the first time she‚Äôs been alone with her, so that certainly won‚Äôt be happening again. 

My wife blew up at me when she came home and I told her (daughter now happily playing with our dog). She started yelling at me, how could I leave our girl alone with MIL, we knew she‚Äôd bully her (I strongly disagree), etc. We ended up arguing for a while (this is rare for the record).

We‚Äôd both previously agreed to not asking MIL for childcare all day but haven‚Äôt discussed leaving daughter with her for a very short amount of time. I thought it would be fine as I was back so soon, and I accept I was wrong but I don‚Äôt think I could have seen it coming based on the last 5 years of MIL‚Äôs behaviour and due to this I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm an AH. 

I apologised to my wife later on and we agreed to disagree but certainly agreed to never leave daughter alone with MIL again and whilst we considered cutting her off, we decided she‚Äôd just have monitored visits with daughter.  

So, AITA or am I right in thinking my wife‚Äôs overreacting due to past trauma related to MIL?

EDIT: Overreacting‚Äôs the wrong word. I was trying more to say is she comparing the damage of years‚Äô worth of snide comments to one single incident. But I do see how that‚Äôs not the most sympathetic thing. I‚Äôm not trying to dismiss her trauma.

I would like to say in my defence that my wife had previously expressed to me her belief that MIL was beginning to change - it wasn‚Äôt solely my perspective.

EDIT 2: some of you seem concerned my wife will think I‚Äôm downplaying her trauma. I‚Äôve always been supportive of her and would never disregard her past to her face or to anyone else expect wondering if her judgement is a bit clouded in my own head. I‚Äôve only said that here, and my wife hasn‚Äôt got Reddit.

Also, you all seem to think we‚Äôve literally never left her alone with her. My bad if I gave this impression. We never have intentionally like this, but inevitably we‚Äôve been in separate rooms for a few moments, used the bathroom, etc - all of which my wife has agreed to. My wife wanted MIL in our daughter‚Äôs life; if she wanted to cut her off I would have agreed. My daughter has repeatedly said this is the first time MIL has treated her like this and she‚Äôs not one to lie so we think this is true.

I‚Äôm not saying that either of their partners are bad people but they are not people we enjoy being around. My DIL is over dramatic and very sensitive. She has to label everything as abusive and she‚Äôs been so much worse since she had her son. She freaks out over everything and has a ton of rules about what the kid can eat, stupid stuff like wanting the pool gated when the glass sliding doors were locked with a key and there is no way he could have gotten out.

My daughters boyfriend is just honestly dumb. He makes stupid noises and laughs, paints his nails, says weird sexual stuff, and asks for money and then does his dumb laugh. He also tries to fight with my wife about her parenting and about shit that happened years ago before we met him.

My wife had a breakdown on Christmas and told me she dreads the holidays and she would rather not celebrate then spend the entire day with people she dislikes. Also she does most of the work and I‚Äôm sure she doesn‚Äôt enjoy cooking for these people. We decided we are done hosting holidays. Easter and thanksgiving we‚Äôll spend with our friends and Christmas we‚Äôll go on a a trip just he two of us.

Due to covid we didn‚Äôt do much for Easter and the kids couldn‚Äôt come over anyway but my wife finally told them (she wanted to make sure they knew way ahead of time) that she doesn‚Äôt want to spend the holidays together anymore because it is just stressful and miserable.

213,AITA for posting a tribute status on Facebook regarding my ex girlfriend who recently passed away without telling my current girlfriend first?,884,Not the A-hole,213,hoc1xi,1594359875.0,"My girlfriend and I, both 22, have been together for about three years now. We knew each other briefly growing up as we lived in the same town but didn't get together until our second year of college. My ex girlfriend and I were childhood best friends, becoming a couple when we were 12 years old and breaking up during our first year of college due to the distance and the relationship just not working. She was one of my best friends so we kept in regular contact and always caught up when we were both in our hometown, which my girlfriend never expressed any issues with. 

About a week ago, I received a text from my ex girlfriends brother telling me that she had passed away during the night due to SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy) and I was completely taken aback. She suffered badly with epilepsy, and asthma, our entire childhoods but it had never been something she was overly concerned about. Due to COVID, my girlfriend and I have been living apart as she is a key worker, so I didn't get to tell her straight away. 

The morning after she passed I posted a status to Facebook basically saying how she was taken too early and that she'll always be a massive part of me. Which she will be, we knew each other our entire lives. I also posted a couple of pictures alongside the post, a few of which being when we were together. I got a lot of support on my post and didn't think much more of it until an hour later when my girlfriend called me. 

I'm friends with her family and friends on Facebook and she said she was mortified to have received texts from them that morning asking what my post was about and whether we'd broken up. My post was clearly from the point of view of a friend so I don't know why that was their first reaction. She told me to take it down to which I refused. It's a post on Facebook and really is not that deep in my opinion. Regardless of whether it's posted, my ex still meant a lot to me and my girlfriend can't erase that. She went on a massive rant about how she always feels compared to my ex which is the furthest thing from the truth. 

When I asked my friends they told me just to take it down out of respect to my girlfriend but I refused again and they called me an asshole saying there's no point in keeping it up if all its going to cause is upset. My parents also told me to take it down but I just do not see the issue. AITA?",False,False,2020-07-09 22:44:35

I was feeling generous and I like the tradition that some countries have that the birthday person pays for everyone's food. However, I am vegan and I do not like the idea of paying for and people eating meat and animal products at a celebration for me. I announced that I would be paying for everyone as long as they did not order meat (I decided that excluding animal products would be too difficult for many to figure out). The restaurant has several vegan options including falafel, veggie kabobs, pita, hummus, dolmas, etc. Everyone heard my request and generally enjoyed the meal.

I noticed that two people (sitting a bit further away from me, if it matters) ordered chicken or lamb when the food came. I was irritated by this, but decided not to say anything since the damage was done, as I felt. When dinner wrapped up, I paid for the food and everyone went their separate ways.

Back at home with my roommate, I complained about the two who ordered and ate meat contrary to my request. He said that he didn't really mind not eating meat, but that I was wrong to ask people to not order meat.

I was thinking about this today, and I want to hear what the consensus is: AITA for requesting that people not order meat for my birthday dinner?

EDIT: I‚Äôm not sure why me being vegan has triggered so many people on here.

215,WIBTA for letting the child I gave up 18 years ago in my life against the wishes of her father?,3422,Everyone Sucks,373,hrx2h2,1594879098.0,"Over 18 years ago when I was 15 I became pregnant with my high school bf‚Äôs baby. I did not want to keep the baby and my parents agreed to let me get an abortion if that was what I wanted. 

I told my high school bf who was 17 at the time that I was pregnant but planed to have an abortion. He did not take this well and ran to his parents to try and stop me. Him and his parents begged for me to keep the baby. 

At the time I was young and easily manipulated. After some time of begging I agreed to carry the baby to term if they paid for everything and then took the baby. When the baby was born I signed my parental rights away with no regrets and all parties agreed I would have no contact with the child. 

I have had no regrets from giving the child up. I went to college and have made a successful career. Met the love of my life and have had two children with him in my own time. 

But 2 months ago I received a Facebook message from the child I gave up 18 years ago. She asked if I was her biological mother and I told her the truth. She asked to meet me and I said yes. 

After meeting we discussed the situation I had been in and she told me she had no anger but only sadness for how things turned out. She told me about her childhood and said her father was a great father to her and she had a great step mother. 

She ended up telling me her father had no clue she had contacted me. I told her that she should tell her father the truth because he did raise her. She agreed and asked me if we could stay in contact and I agreed. 

To be honest even though I had no regrets from my decision and was happy to see this girl had an amazing life, I saw no reason to exclude her from mine if we both agreed to a healthy adult relationship. I had no plans to be her mother and made this clear and she understood. 

But only a week after our first meet up I got a very angry call from her biological father. He told me I had no right to be in her life now. I told him I didn‚Äôt necessarily disagree but she was the one that sought me out and it would be cruel to deny her. This of course only made him angry. I tried to assure him I wasn‚Äôt trying to take a parental stance in her life and he had nothing to worry about but he didn‚Äôt care. He told me I needed to stay true to our agreement and stay away from his kid. 

Ever since then I had only talked to the girl through text. Every time she asks to meet up I give her an excuse. I feel awful giving her the run around but I don‚Äôt want to hurt her relationship with her father and step mother. WIBTA for letting this girl into my life more?

EDIT/Update: I very much agree that I should not be lying to her. I honestly really would like a relationship with her as long as she wants one with me.

His mom just got recommended she go on a diet because her family has history of diabetes, but she disregarded the advice. Which doesn't bother me; she's an adult and its her choice. I recently started watching sil during the days, and at my in laws house they let her eat horribly. She'll have chips, fast food, ice cream, and candy for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. She's also not very active. I personally am very healthy and I feed my family home-cooked meals 3 times a day, and we do buy sweets/snacks but they're not something that I let my son eat every day. When my sil comes over she frequently gets upset with me for not letting her eat however she wants. Im not trying to be mean, I just want to make sure she eats healthy, because if her mom is at risk for diabetes, she is as well and I figure if I can instill in her some healthy habits, she might make better choices on her own. I know its hard to start eating healthy when you grow up constantly eating junk. I don't have her on a ""diet"", I feed her the same foods that I feed the rest of my family. 

This all came to a boiling point yesterday when she said she wanted ice cream. I told her we didn't have any, but I'd make her a snack. I cut up some apples for her and my son and put some peanut butter in a cup for them to eat with it. I brought it out for her and she knocked the food onto my carpet. I told her she clearly wasn't hungry if she didn't want the fruit, and that she needed to clean it up right away. She refused. I just left the situation alone until mil came to get her.

She also said sil wasn't in the wrong for knocking food onto the floor and wasting it.. I said that sil can eat whatever she wants in their home, but it's not fair to my son if I buy sweets out of my own pocket and let sil have them constantly even though he only gets them once a week, and it's not fair for mil to try to undermine my house rules especially when I'm watching her daughter for free.

219,"WIBTA if I stop allowing my family business to support my siblings and mother, against my late father's wishes?",809,Not the A-hole,144,hqenm3,1594673308.0,"When I was a baby, my father started a business. He ran it himself until I was 23, and we ran it together until I was 25, when he died. Since then, for the last 25 years, I have run the business alone.

My father always emphasized that he wanted the business to support our family (my mother and their kids). Since he started the business, the profits have always been split evenly between the family members. That was eventually five shares: my mother, me, and my three siblings. Until my siblings and I went to to college, our money was invested to eventually pay for our education, but after that it was just given to us to use as we wanted.

Since my father died, I have continued this practice. When I took over the business, the shares were about $2000 per person per year, but in the last five years the business has done very well, and the shares have been about $50,000 yearly each.

Eight years ago, my husband and I adopted our son Thomas' best friend, Daniel, whose parents had kicked him out of their house for being gay. We tried very hard to welcome Daniel into our family, and we consider him a son. Sadly, my family have never made an effort to include him. In fact, they intentionally leave him out when it comes to family events and holidays, and are so disrespectful of him that we have mostly cut off contact with them.

For the last five years, Daniel has shown a very strong interest in the business. He's worked there over the summers and has done a kind of internship while he's been in college. I recently decided that I'd like for Daniel to eventually run the business with me, ideally with the aim of taking over from me when I retire. When I told Daniel and Thomas about the idea, they were both very happy with it. My family obviously aren't happy about it. They told me that Daniel isn't a ""real"" son, so I should be planning to leave the business to Thomas (who isn't interested) or one of my brothers (neither of whom have ever worked in the business and both of whom have careers that aren't related) instead.

I told them off and said that if they didn't like my family, they can stop enjoying money from the family business. I was planning to cut them off completely, but my husband said that would be an asshole move, and after thinking about it, I agreed. So together, my husband and I came up with a different plan. Obviously any change will make my family think I'm an asshole, so I wanted to get an outside view from all of you on how asshole-y this plan would be:

I take the profits and give $10,000 to my mother, and split the rest eight ways: one each for my five nephews and nieces, one each for Daniel and Thomas, and the last to be split among my employees as a bonus. The money given to my nephews and nieces (who are 9-17) would be in trusts for their education. This way the money is still supporting the family, but in a way that doesn't make me feel like I'm supporting people hostile to my son.

I am a 24 year old guy, this kind of shit doesn't usually bother me but I can't seem to go a single day at work without some comment about my weight loss. It's been non stop since we reopened after lockdown.

Here are some of the rumours about me: I have cancer, I have aids, I'm on drugs. 

I'm tired of it. Yes I'm quite skinny now, but no one was ""concerned"" about me when I was fat! It's all fake, they don't actually care, it's just gossip to them. There are plenty other people at work that are my weight or thinner, and no one cares! 

A couple of coworkers seem legitimately concerned, but they were more polite. Even then I still get annoyed because my weight is quite frankly nobody's business but mine. People will bring me food from the vending machines and stare at me when I eat and it makes me nervous. I'm on a strict diet because obviously I have to MAINTAIN my weight loss, I can't just eat chocolate bars. 

Yesterday one of the more gossipy ones, an older lady in her 50s, approached me in front of everyone telling me she was concerned I wasn't healthy and I wasn't able to do my job. 

I'm perfectly able to do my job. I angrily told her it was none of her business and that if there were issues with how I was doing the job someone higher up would tell me. She then asked me straight up if I was using drugs. I yelled at her ""I'm not on drugs and I don't have cancer either. Is a fat person losing weight really this shocking to you?""

Since the start of college me and my friends have been doing this movie club thing. Basically we meet twice a week in the evening to watch movies and then discuss them from a cinematic and storytelling standpoint (we are all either film or English mayors and love movies). We decided I should ""host"" the club since I have my own place and we can stay until late watching and talking without any interference, I agreed because I really liked the idea.

Now, since I was 4 I suffered from bullying, like really hard bullying. I was in a very shitty school that was excellent academically but shitty socially. This caused me to develop serious mental health issues when I was 12. These include anxiety that is way beyond normal (sorry I can‚Äôt remember the medical term rn) and psychotic depression. What does this mean? I hallucinate a-lot, have anxiety attacks constantly and a very severe depression made my whole senior year in high school more psychiatric hospital than school. My friends are all aware of all of this and while I don't like talking about it a lot of it can be easily seen after spending some time with me. The problem came a week ago when I found out that all of them (7 people) have a chat without me where they spend a lot of time talking about how they are sure that I am lying on everything I just told you about my mental health. That hurt because the chat is very recent and everyone had said some pretty nasty stuff/laughed at my issue. Again, I almost never mention it to anyone unless you really get to notice me, I don't like involving people either. The closest to a conversation coming from me might be an ""I am with my psychiatrist"" when they ask me where am I or something like that. It really hurt because the things they said were on the same level as the bullying that caused me this to begin this all those years ago (except the physical stuff obviously). I talked to all of them and they admitted it but refused to apologize because they couldn't believe anything of all of that, they keep saying that I am a ""compulsive liar looking for attention"" however that is obviously not true.

I decided that I would leave the movie club and not allow them to make the club in my place until all of them sincerely apologized, they still refused. Notice that I didn't stop them from doing the club in another place; just that I will not participate and that I will not be in my place. They told me am I an asshole for doing this...am I?

I am also extremely light skinned can create the impression that I am ""safe"" or ""acceptable"", This leads to a lot of casual racism. My BF (M33) has a very close-knit family and they are super liberal on the surface but his father and sister have made it clear they don't like that I am Black. The sister's BF is an avowed racist, with a loud mouth. He is also a weird gross person 

Anyway, after months of avoiding his family (and explaining why) my BFs birthday rolls around. I decided to go since it was a special occasion and I wanted to celebrate my man. Big mistake. The sister's BF couldn't even get through his first bite without starting in on the sanctity of the Confederate Flag. When I mentioned that it was a symbol of slavery treason he makes the choice to start out right defending slavery. I was more surprised than anything, and since my BFs family was so liberal I figured he was about to get shut down for embarrassing them. His dad just straight up agreed with him and his mom reprimanded me for embarrassing them in public (I was red in the face but talking low, he was screaming.) My BF did nothing and shut down. What's worse is that I sat there and did nothing. I just ate my meal and shut up and I hated myself the whole time. As soon as we got out of the restaurant I laid into my BF for putting me in the situation and not defending me (this is what they mean by White silenceis violence.) I was also really mad at myself, the first reprimand from a motherly woman shut me down completely. I stayed with a friend until I calmed down. 

When I got home I made it clear that dinner was my last straw. I honestly saw it as him proving that he couldn't handle the work it takes to be in love with a Black person and I was out the door. However, he said he wanted to put in the work to do better and he has gone above and beyond. We also worked out some boundaries with his family between ourselves (he also sat down with them about the dinner and explained why I wouldn't be around.) They are subtle, my BF loves his family and I would never demand he cut off contact, but his family is starting to notice. His mom loves to give little gifts as well as cook and drop off food for us.  It is a sweet thing to do but we are often made to feel indebted/ungrateful. Also I wasn't raised to take gifts from people who don't respect me. The more we politely decline the more angry the whole family is getting. My BF is behind me and says he is ok with it but I am honestly starting to feel like a dick (and her ziti was bomb.) 
AITA?

Update: 
Ok, so I am new to reddit and this is my first time I have really seen the community in action and you guys are awesome. You gave me a lot of perspective, I just wanted to clarify some things.

As far as my BF is concerned I did not do a good job communicating his stance with his family after the dinner. He wanted to cut off contact completely with his family after the dinner but I thought it would lead to an even more hostile situation so I asked him not to (plus he works for his dad, which is something I should have mentioned.) As of now they talk on the phone maybe once a week and text off and on. They are lashing out but my BF seems fine with this arrangement. I was still feeling a lot of guilt. They used to do weekly Sunday dinners and since I lost my mom I don't have any family. I think I felt like I was taking something away from him between the family time and the food. So I talked to my BF, he said that any consequence were from his families behavior not mine and that I deserve to be safe. He apologized again for not keeping me safe. I think this situation had a lot to do with me having a hard time seeing my own worth.

All of that is really nice but it has also only been 6 months. We were moving towards getting married in the next few years but I am just not comfortable taking a next step until I see how things look long term. In my experience it is easy to fall back into old patterns and I am not bringing babies into a bad situation. I need to be able to set firm boundaries for myself in this situation and he needs to be an ally everywhere, with everyone. He is a good personand we love each other a lot so I am willing to see how it goes but I am 110% gone if we can't figure this out.",False,1594907086.0,2020-07-15 16:01:54

There are always threats of divorce being thrown at my mom(42f) by my dad(44m). 

The most recent interaction was two days ago, where my dad wanted me to go on a walk with him and my mom told him to take my sisters (ages 7 and 3) too because she was too tired to watch them (keep in mind she watches them all the time, and he works all day. this was during a weekend, for a less than one hour walk). 
My dad was furious and called her a bad mom for not being able to watch her children.  

Yesterday my mom asked me what POS means. I told her it stands for piece of shit. She seemed taken aback at first and then went into the bathroom for a while and came out visibly looking as if she had been crying. I know for a fact that my dad must have texted her calling her a POS because he has a habit of sending lots of verbally abusive emails and texts to her after a fight. 


For a while, my dad hasn‚Äôt been eating the food my mom cooks. He buys frozen meals from grocery stores and makes sure he‚Äôs very loud while unwrapping and microwaving them. He doesn‚Äôt even bother to hide it from his children. My sister (7F) asked me why her dad won‚Äôt eat the food my mom cooks. I just told her he‚Äôs on a diet because I didn‚Äôt know what to say. my mom asks me to cook food sometimes so that he will actually eat the food prepared at home. I did that once but I honestly don‚Äôt give a fuck anymore. He can go eat his nasty frozen meals and I won‚Äôt do anything about it. 

However, my mom is obviously hurt about it. Today during dinner he kept trying to make conversation with me and I actively ignored him. I really wanted to tell him that he‚Äôs petty and disrespectful for what he‚Äôs doing. I can‚Äôt make myself shut up so I‚Äôm sitting in my room right now and I need someone to tell me if this is wrong. I hate the idea of my sisters seeing this shit from such a young age, and my mom feeling so hurt. 

Basically, WIBTA if I called my dad out for what he‚Äôs doing?

edit: the main reason I think I might be the asshole for saying this is that once, my parents were having a very big fight and my dad was repeatedly saying my mom belongs in hell and i couldn‚Äôt stand it. I yelled shut up at him and he ignored me for days till i apologized, and he was still cold after it. I only apologized because my mom begged me to. 

But then seeing how upset my mom was that my dad didn‚Äôt talk to me for so long, i kept myself quiet this time and avoided saying anything about the frozen meals thing.

226,AITA for not disciplining or attempting to control my children during my partners meeting?,736,Not the A-hole,132,hr4uj7,1594773512.0,"So we‚Äôre all working from home during covid. 

We have a total of 5 working indoor /  outdoor spaces in the home where we can work from. Criteria being a flat surface for a computer (table /desk) and comfortable chair, and fast internet connection. 

We also have a beautiful home office which my partner built for us, to be able to join meetings in a quiet, private, professional space. It‚Äôs important to the story to note, this space did not exist pre Covid, and my partner specifically built this space for this purpose. 

The last work space is the dining room table. Now - this is the largest table for sure. It is also feet from the kitchen, meters from the front door, feet from the stairs leading upstairs, and about maybe 5 meters tops from the main living area. So basically it‚Äôs the epicenter of the home. Right smack dab in the middle of everything.  

My partner *insists* on taking her meetings at the dining room table, the epicenter of the home. 

Now, I have two children who are also stuck at home with nothing to do. I feel badly for my eldest, as she‚Äôs very conscious of my partners meetings, and feels she can‚Äôt use the ground floor of our home at all. I‚Äôve assured her that my partner knows what she‚Äôs doing when she chooses that work space, and she should feel free to use the kitchen and living room normally. She doesn‚Äôt anyways, bc she is fairly shy, and the idea of being caught in the background is not something she‚Äôs comfortable with. 

I have repeatedly asked my partner why she chooses to work there when it‚Äôs so prone to interruptions, she says she‚Äôs more comfortable there, and she doesn‚Äôt want to work anywhere else. 

Now, every ounce of discomfort my eldest has about appearing or interrupting these meetings, my youngest (6) lacks entirely. He constantly, endlessly interrupts with loud television shows, playing video games with his friends and shouting at the top of his lungs ( wearing earphones, can‚Äôt hear himself). 

So this brings us to today. I‚Äôm upstairs working and I repeatedly hear my partner muting herself to scold my youngest for yelling, etc. My eldest comes in to say she‚Äôs starving and doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable to go down to the kitchen. Normally I would stop what I‚Äôm doing, fetch her something to eat, and reprimand my youngest for interrupting etc. 

This time I just thought, let it be what it is. If you set up in the loudest part of the house , you will be in the loudest part of the house. I let my youngest do his thing and told my daughter I would join her in the kitchen to make her feel
more comfortable. 

Now my partner is frustrated with me, saying I didn‚Äôt do anything to help when she‚Äôs clearly struggling. I do feel bad about that, but I just don‚Äôt understand why she can‚Äôt comprise and set up somewhere else. Maybe it was petty of me - but that‚Äôs the reality of the situation.

The other day my fianc√©e came to me, in tears, saying that my brother had called her and thanked her for letting him propose at the wedding. She told him that had never happened, and he wasn't allowed to do that, and he just laughed and thanked her again. 

I called my brother back and asked him what was going on. He's insisting that he's going to propose to his girlfriend at the wedding. He claims it's ""getting even"" for when I announced our engagement at the same family dinner he brought his girlfriend to meet the family (I had no idea, they arrived separately and she got there after I had made the announcement). 

I told him if he doesn't get it through his head that he is absolutely not allowed to propose, both him and his girlfriend won't be allowed into the wedding at all, and if he tries to pull a stunt, he'll be kicked out immediately. 

He didn't take it well and told the whole family. My fianc√©e and I have been getting calls and messages from them telling us how shitty we are for doing that, how dare I turn my back on my brother. 

He's also now blaming me for spoiling the proposal to his girlfriend and the family, because if I hadn't been ""such an ass"", he wouldn't have had to break the news to the family like this.

228,"AITA for being pissed that my parents never told me that an MRI once suggested the possibility of a brain tumor, even after I started suffering neurological symptoms as an adult?",728,Not the A-hole,97,hp23po,1594462549.0,"I'll keep to brief. I'm 30.

I'll just begin by stating I don't have a great relationship with my parents.

When I was eleven, I got an MRI for persistent headaches and a higher than average height for my age. I (was) eleven, female and 5'7''. The first MRI found strong evidence of a pituitary adenoma, which is normally associated with giganticism. They did a second MRI which concluded everything was normal. I grew to 5'8'' and stopped some time in middle school. The headaches eventually went away back would come back now and again throughout my life.

I was unaware of the MRI findings until today. I did remember getting an MRI, and what it was for, but have always been told that both MRIS were 100% normal and suggested nothing odd. My parents did not provide these medical records and I had to pay to receive them from a hospital this week.

About three years ago, I began to have weird, non-specific symptoms. I think a lot of people around me thought I was imagining the symptoms. A year ago the symptoms became so severe that I was sent to the ER. TLDR I was diagnosed with temporal lobe seizures of unknown cause.

They did an MRI and found a very small adenoma on my pituitary gland that they thought was likely not producing hormones. Well, I recently had a hormone panel which found very high IGF1 levels which suggests I have very high GH levels. This is associated with acromegaly, a very rare disorder that progresses over time and results in disfigurement. The doctor expects to confirm this diagnosis with another test.

I really can't know how long the adenoma has been active, only that it's about 99% likely to be the same damn adenoma they found on their first MRI when I was 11. I really can't know if these levels have contributed to seizures. I guess I'll never know objectively if my face is ""deformed"" or not, only that my doctor says I do not yet have clear or otherwise obvious physical indications of the disease. What I do know is that I feel betrayed and am absolutely livid that even after I told my parents about my seizures a year ago, they never once thought it a good idea that I had an abnormal MRI scan when I was 11.

I confronted them about it today, sent a screenshot and asked, ""Why didn't you ever tell me about this, even after I started having seizures at 29?"" and they in turn accused me of accusing them of being terrible parents, and mom left a minutes long voicemail on the phone crying (IMO, trying to make it all about her, something she does and that I am used to), and claim all the doctors told them is that the MRI needed to be redone because I ""moved."" And to be fair, I do consider them terrible parents in this respect -- as a parent you ask questions, you demand records, and if they're lying to me, you don't withhold inconvenient information from your kid.

IDK what to think. I know I am hurting. I feel like I have a reason to feel hurt and frustrated. And I want to know if I'm the asshole in this situation, which my parents are suggestion.",False,1594433946.0,2020-07-11 03:15:49
229,AITA for wanting my twin/cousin to walk me down the aisle over my parents?,723,Not the A-hole,81,hp9h0w,1594500714.0,"The short version is my parents got pregnant accidentally. Then they found out it was twins. They could afford one baby, but not two, and my mum's sister (my aunt) had been trying for years to have a kid, so they agreed to have one each. My parents kept me and gave my sister to my aunt and uncle, and we were raised as cousins.

When we were 19 our nan asked us to come over and see her. She then told us the truth, saying she debated telling us but she'd given our parents a year to tell us, telling them if they didn't tell us at any point between our 18th and 19th birthdays then she would. We confronted both sets of parents, who confessed everything. We weren't totally stupid, we knew we were identical, and we had brought this up a few times in our lives, but the response was always ""you don't look any more like her than you do your other cousins"" or something similar, and we'd noticed the way our parents tried to discourage us from spending time together but they'd never give a straight answer as to why.

So finding this out really damaged our relationship with our parents. We felt like we couldn't trust them any more as they were able to keep such an important secret from us. My sister had it worse, as she found out her parents weren't her bio parents and that they lied about everything, even her birthday, to hide the truth.

We're now 28. We're open about being sisters and are really close, and we've both rebuilt our relationships with our parents (though she considers our aunt and uncle to be her parents and won't acknowledge our bio parents which is fair enough tbh). I'm engaged. My partner and I agreed not to do the whole walking down the aisle thing, but then he thought about it and he really wants his brother to walk him because of a long history with his parents that meant his brother basically raised him. Because of this I need someone to walk me. I asked my sister to do it.

I was talking to my parents about the wedding a few days ago and dad made a comment about walking me down the aisle. I then explained that I'd asked my sister to do it because my fiance's brother is walking him. He got really quiet in the way he does when he's upset, and mum asked me to reconsider, but I held firm. We ended the call shortly after (though we'd only been on the call less than 5 mins and typically talk for at least 30).

Then the messages started coming. Basically saying they'd made a mistake when they were young and stupid and they can't believe I'm still holding it against them 28 years later, that this is the only time dad would have been able to do it (they know how my sister feels about them and aside from her I only have 2 brothers) and that they really wish I'd reconsider, and called me ""cruel"" for choosing to ""embarrass"" them over something this important. My brothers have texted echoing their sentiments. I now feel really bad.

They would damage my things, pass around funny letters about me, make fun of my looks(I was fat and short) and things like that. My parents weren't much of a help either and were in a way worse but that's another story.


I went through a drastic change in personality during my Secondary school years and became bullies just like those boys. I am not proud of it now, but back then it gave me a sense of comfort knowing that I have power over somebody else and a bunch of sisters in crime.


I went through another change after going to college when I started to have a healthier way of dealing with negative emotions. My college friends helped me a lot and I got to move out of my toxic family too.


It's funny but, I happened to meet one of my bullies again as he studied under my step brother(who moved out years before me). We kind of got to know each other again and along with a few other of the students, we became friends. And the funnier thing is, his girlfriend happened to be one of the girls I used to bully.

For context, the guy never apologized to me either. We recognized each other but got together as friends like we were strangers, never talking about the past.

I (26F) bought a Switch 2 years ago. From then, I have been buying a bunch of games for it (\~40+ games). My switch is stress reliever and I love it a lot. Recently, Nintendo announced and launched the animal crossing switch. I fell in love with it right away and grabbed it (I loved my other switch but the battery died so quickly).

I have a stepsister (34) whose son (7) have been staying home because of COVID. My relationship with them is not of the closed one, she also lived in different city (\~ 1 hr drive). Recently, she came to visit me and brought her kid. Whenever she came visit before, I just let her kid played with my switch. Well, this time, she noticed I had 2 switches with me. She then asked me if she can have my old switch for her son and how the Covid is making him depressed at home. I was reluctant but agreed to give it to her (The whole package: switch, attached joy-cons, doc, charger). Of course, before I gave it to her, I deactivate my Nintendo‚Äòs account. The kid was happy.

Couple of hours after she left, she called asking why none of the game is playable. I told her that some games required game cards (which I had) and she can‚Äôt play my downloaded games because I deactivated my account from it. She then told me to reactivate it for her kid. I then explained to her that Nintendo only permits one primary console, even if I activate my account on that switch, it‚Äòs a non primary one and she can‚Äôt play any of my games also. Beside, I linked my credit card with the account and don‚Äôt feel comfortable enough to share that. She cried, saying how her kid looked forward to play the switch right away, and asked me to give her some of my game cards. I told her no since those are $60/game and those are my games. She then asked me to make the switch my primary console. I again told her no (half of my games are downloaded games). She hung up on me. Hung up I tell you, and wrote a fb post telling the world that I ruined her child‚Äòs childhood and how I‚Äôm being selfish. I got mad and replied to her post saying how I was being generous when I gave her the switch, but if this is how she‚Äôs going to behave, then please give me back my switch. She again called me selfish and tried to turn my other family members against me. It‚Äôs a whole different drama.

So reddit, AITA for not giving my stepsister my games?

EDIT: thank you for your responses. Some people told me that I should tell my step-sister beforehand that I was just giving her the switch.

In addition, my nephew had been wanting the switch for a while and my step-sister did do some researches on it and sometimes asked me about how it worked. She did bring up the primary console thing before in a different conversation  since she has more kids and want to see if she can link the account more than one. I assumed she knew all about it.

EDIT 2: thank you for all your kind words. A bit update on my situation.

She then had the audacity to ask me for the pokeball plus controller (it came with this version of the switch) so she can sell it in a higher price.

234,AITA for letting my grandpa eat his favorite food?,708,Not the A-hole,156,hqjc8y,1594689134.0,"Throwaway as I don't need my main account spammed like my other social media...

First some background which is neccessary. I (27F) have gotten into a signifcant amount of debt because of my ex (details are not important). It was my own naivity and stupidity and I never said otherwise. I am currently working two jobs to pay the debt. I have never asked anyone to help me with my financial situation and I don't complain about it. My mistake - my problem.

I have a grandpa (88) who is one of the most cheerful people I known. I've learned a lot from him and his positive outlook on life. As he got older he started getting diagnosed with various conditions that limit him in his life, one of these is that he can't eat spicy food.

About two months ago he was diagnosed with cancer on top of his other issues. For him it's the same as a death sentence, either the cancer kills him or the treatment. He was pretty chill about it, always saying he's lived a good life and has no regrets.

Two weeks ago it was his birthday and since lockdown has been lifted where I live, my family organized a party at his house. I thought we'd stay the whole weekend, as it's going to be the last birthday party my grandpa will have, but it was just my family cooking a huge lunch, we ate and they all left by 5pm.

I stayed because I had taken a whole weekend off to spend time with granpda and I had to wait for a train home anyway. Grandpa didn't seem suprised. He's asked me if I have time and I said yes. He then said that he has bought his favorite cheese (chilli flavoured) and would like to eat it for his last birthday.

I asked him if he is aware that eating the cheese might actually kill him and he said he is, that's why he would like for me to be there so that I can call an ambulance and in case he died he doesn't die alone. I didn't feel very comfortable with it but I just could bring myself to refuse so I agreed to stay.

He's excitingly got into the kitchen and made himself his most favorite sandwich with the chilli cheese. We then sat down and I watched him eat it savoring every bite and grinning from ear to ear. Afterwards he went into cardiac arrest (or something similar) so I called an ambulance and rode with him to the hospital. He's been in a coma since and most likely won't wake up.

My family arrived shortly after and I told them what happened. I thought they'd be understanding but they just berated me for letting grandpa eat the cheese. I eventually went home only to find out they are spreading on social media that I killed grandpa to get inheritance and they're going to sue me.

Fortunatelly grandpa took precautions with his lawyer so I can't be charged with murder, but I lost one of my jobs based on these accusations. My friends lend me some money until I can find another job but I am just mad at my family for spreading lies. It was grandpa's decision to do this and I don't think honoring a dying man's wish to not die alone makes me a murderer.

Or does it?

Edit: I wasn't going to respond to this, but since a few people called me a troll I thought I should. I have changed the details in the story so that my family cannot google the real scenario. The point stays that he ate his favorite food and landed in hospital in a coma. 

Also I'd like to thank all for kind words and to the person who said the family is after inheritance, definitely. One aunt texted me that she's ""going to snitch the money from me"". Grandpa is well off and from what I know he has a will in place. However I don't believe anyone can touch my part of inheritance legally unless I was indeed convicted as his murderer.

She has really bad insomnia, so getting to sleep and staying asleep.  She's been to doctors,  and sleep tests,  and has tried medication but she says the best solution she's found is sleeping for 4 hours, waking up for a few hours,  then back to sleep for another few hours. 

I thought I could deal with that but it was more.  She hates sleeping next to people,  which I didn't know until I moved in.  She's says she's scared if waking people up and being woken up by people.  I can see that because I have snapped at her a few times when she's woken me up. 

This means she doesn't want to cuddle at night in bed.  Its ok on the couch,  but not in bed.  The whole point of sleeping with your girlfriend is to cuddle,  but she hates it.  When I do convince her to do it,  she's on her phone all night. She doesn't even try to sleep. 

The past two weeks she's taken to sleeping on the couch instead of in bed and it's driven this huge wedge between us.  I'm angry because she's given up even trying and it feels like she resents me.  

This all blew over when she commented her back has been hurting from sleeping on the couch and she wanted to get a hotel room for the night so she could sleep.  It was heavily implied I would not be welcome and would be staying in her apartment.  

I lost it. It is completely a waste of money and a health risk right now.  If she just tried sleeping in bed with me instead of the couch she'd be fine.  She could take some sleeping meds and be fine,  I know she's taken them before to sleep.

Then comes pandemic. They're out of school, not allowed to meet up with groups. We're not in lockdown but not a lot of functions are open yet, so they've been staying home all day.

My parents have a farm and they've released employees from seasonal contracts and are trying to do everything themselves with the help of family. In the absence of my kids doing things outside of the house, I've volunteered them to my parents to help once a week for two hours. I've coined it ""exercise time"" because it's manual labor. Nothing crazy: things like weed whacking, mowing, trimming hedges, carrying bales, etc. 

My kids have complained about this but I think it's fair: two hours a week when otherwise they're just watching Netflix or playing videogames. This helps them get outside a bit during the pandemic, helps my parents, and helps my husband and I have some much needed time to ourselves.

A couple months ago they started potty training her since she seemed interested and they were home all day with quarantine.  She‚Äôs been doing great but still has her moments, like all kids do.  

The biggest problem was her not using the toilet when she was outside her home.  Wasn‚Äôt a big deal at first since they hardly went anywhere.  
But, I‚Äôm not babysitting her and her brother a couple days a week.  

I read a trick online that says to let your kid pick their own underwear so they get more excited about using the toilet.  This and the reward system her parents had set up seemed like a good idea.  I talked to her parents and they were excited that she would have her own stash at my place so it would seem like a cool new thing.  

I took her shopping and she picked out a pack of Spider-Man underwear and a pack of pink flowers.  We got back to my place and washed them (she loves doing laundry at my place because both washer and dryer are front loading and she can ‚Äúhelp‚Äù throw things in there) and then she chose to put on a Spider-Man pair.  

A couple hours later and there were no accidents and we were all excited.  Her parents came to pick her up and she ran to them and dropped her pants to tell them ‚Äúno potty in my pants! Did not pee on Spider-Man!‚Äù 

Well her dad got kind of annoyed at me that I let her pick out ‚Äúboy‚Äù underwear.  Told me I should‚Äôve just grabbed a couple packs of anything pink and unicorn.  
It got into a small annoyance when I told him that she picked them out and was excited to not pee on Spider-Man.  

He didn‚Äôt really say anything and they left.  But he did text me later to say that I needed to not let her watch so many ‚Äúboy‚Äù shows or play with ‚Äúboy‚Äù toys.

I got a little pissed and reminded him that she has a job, and works for the clothes she buys for herself. 

My brother, rolling his eyes, went ‚Äúyeah but they‚Äôre not necessary‚Äù

My mom does a majority of the cooking, cleaning, and housework. I like to help out even though I mess up at a lot of things so I understand how much work it is. On top of all, she had a part time job to help pay for bills, clothes (for us), and food. She also recently found out her mom was tested positive for COVID, so she‚Äôs under a lot of stress right now.

I explained all of that to him, getting increasingly angry and frustrated at how selfish he was being, when my dad essentially told me to shut up. He said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not supposed to talk about this stuff‚Äù

My brother is NEVER disciplined for his actions with the excuse of ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù. I‚Äôm honestly sick of it, especially because I‚Äôm constantly held to a higher standard than him.

Young woman/anti vaxxer: AV

Friend: D

Friends son: baby

So I drove my friend (D) and her baby to the clinic for his checkup and a vaccine (unsure what vaccine but he‚Äôs about a year old) I‚Äôm basically a second mom to this kid so I had no issue driving them to the clinic after all. I waited in the car and they were back in no time. We decided to go get some ice cream since this kid loves ice cream and he just get a shot. So we go, order, get our ice cream and go sit outside. (We don‚Äôt like to be indoors since the outbreak is still very real in my state). We notice this young woman (AV) about the same age as my friend (D), who has a baby about the same age as my friends son. The two start talking because young moms with babies around the same age seem to love to talk to each other. The young mom (AV) sees the bandaid on my friends son and asks what happened, D explains they just got a vaccine, AV said something that got my blood boiling. Word for word ‚Äúoh well enjoy today with him since he won‚Äôt be the same when the autism starts.‚Äù My autistic ass turned my head so fast I‚Äôm sure I looked like the girl from the exorcist movie. 

Me: that‚Äôs literally not how vaccines work and has been debunked so many times and even if he (baby) did have autism, it‚Äôs not from a vaccine and autism isn‚Äôt a bad thing as I have autism and so does one of my friends and both of us are fine. 

AV: you don‚Äôt have autism, if you did you wouldn‚Äôt be able to communicate or be out without someone. Maybe your friend is autistic due to vaccines but you are not.

Me: my friend was diagnosed with autism as a child and wasn‚Äôt vaccinated until she was 20 but go off. Not all autistic people are what you think we are. A lot of us have jobs, go to college, and have lives of our own. Sadly your crib rat will probably pass before being able to experience having a job or going to college as their mom is a complete and total moron that would rather believe BS lies than let her kids live pass 7. 

She and D looked horrified. We finish our ice cream and leave without a peep from anyone. When D and I got back into my car, D told me even if I am right, that was a very assholeish thing to say to a young mom with a young baby. At first I didn‚Äôt think I was an asshole but after thinking about it, I kind of feel like one.. I basically told this young mom her kid is going to die because she‚Äôs an idiot. Am I the asshole?

Edit: wow this got a a lot of comment. Probably one of the most active things I‚Äôve posted on Reddit.

My ex was in an accident a few years ago that left her with really bad facial scarring. She was very angry and depressed after the accident. After a while she refused to see anyone including her therapist. At the time we did not have very good health insurance so I did understand why because her therapist wasn‚Äôt great. I still tried to be supportive and encourage her to go, but being around her became very hard.

Anyway last year I got offered a job on the other side of the state. Which is great because I had been laid off a couple months earlier. The job came with great benefits so even though it was far away and I didn‚Äôt like the work we couldn‚Äôt afford for me not take it.

My ex did not come with me because she was still having very bad anxiety issues and did not want to be away from the last friend she had in an unfamiliar area.

After being away from her for seven months and being around regular happy people all the time I realized I was so unhappy in the relationship. I started to dread her calls. That‚Äôs when I decided I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore and we legally separated with the plan to divorce. It got delayed though because the courts are backed up right now and will take probably another 6 months to be official.

Anyway last week I got offered a job at a different company. It doesn‚Äôt pay as much and doesn‚Äôt have health insurance, but it was something I wanted to do for awhile. It is also sort of competitive to get into so I said yes right away because I didn‚Äôt want to lose my shot.

I tried calling my ex, but she didn‚Äôt answer so I sent a text to her telling her because she was going to need to find a new insurance plan as mine was ending since I was leaving job the week after next. 

She never replied and later I got a really angry message from her friend. 

Unbeknownst to me ex had gotten a better therapist with the new insurance and she said she was making many strides and that the new insurance would cover her getting plastic surgery to fix the scars she has. 

Her friend said my ex was inconsolable because I was pulling the rug out from under her in two weeks when she thought she had six months. She also brought up how it was bad enough that I had left her considering the in sickness and in health part of our vows.

Recently her mom lost her job and they got evicted from their apartment. Stepdaughter now wants to come stay with us like she normally does every summer. However this time she wants her mom to stay with us too because she‚Äôs lost her job and has no place to live. 

My husband thinks it could work but I‚Äôm 100% against it. For one thing I bought this house before I got married and I don‚Äôt want my husband‚Äôs ex sleeping in one of my guest bedrooms. Simple right? Stepdaughter is upset that I‚Äôve laid down the law and accused me of trying to keep her and her mom apart. I told her she doesn‚Äôt have to stay with us this summer, but my rules are final. 

So now she and her mom are staying with another relative one state over. My husband now wants to stay near them over the next few weeks as a result because he won‚Äôt see stepdaughter rest of this year otherwise.

**Edit:** to clarify, stepdaughter won‚Äôt leave her mom this year for a bunch of random reasons, nothing comprehensible or legitimate imo. Husband has no custody of her so we can‚Äôt force her to come live with us, even though living with us by herself is the obvious solution (I know I know). 

So husband thinks best course of action is to drive to see her. Honestly that‚Äôs a dealbreaker for me.

But I still freak out at any kind of conflict with these people because they've accused me of being dramatic or an ass for years, when in reality I was a depressed and anxious teen. Now I believe them when maybe I shouldn't about things like this. 

Background: I (21F) have always had a weird as hell family dynamic. My folks divorced when I was 4 and had split custody while I was growing up and my dad remarried a horrible, abusive, woman who hates me because I ""am a constant reminder that she's not my dad's first."" (Those were her exact words to me, even though SHE KNEW THIS well before they got married... I digress.) She's basically treated me like Cinderella my whole life and has trained the kids she had with my dad to do the same while my dad kinda stood idly by. Despite this and the fact that I was in and out of the house a bunch when they were growing up, both of the kids are really protective of their place in my life (a fact I wasn't aware of until recently). 

So fast forward, my birthday was Wednesday and my best friend (who has been a consistent and steady positive voice in my life since I moved out and got to college) posted something really sweet on my Instagram feed in which she called me her sister. I loved it, because she's really stepped into that role for me, and I called her my sister right back. 

A few minutes later I got kinda grilled on it from my little sister (13) over IG messenger but didn't think much of it... Until my dad called later and was telling me about how angry and hurt it made her. So now I feel like TA and really anxious about it. I told my best friend about what happened and now she feels bad too. 

I don't feel like my relationship with my friend is wrong, especially given how incredibly screwed up my dynamic with that side of my family is, but after my dad said what he did, Idk what to think. On one hand, I don't feel like my siblings should have the ability to lay claim to a place in my life if they're going to continue the abusive behavior patterns, but on the other hand, they ARE my blood, and they're young. I feel a sense of obligation to maintain a relationship with them, especially since I have a pretty significant disability that prevents me from walking and I've been warned from a young age that they'll probably be taking care of me once my parents pass.

E told me bluntly and explicitly that she's having her period at that time, but whatever, she'll sunbathe or something. 

To this I replied, ""wow, girl, TMI"", with a few rolling eye emojis and a funny gif to signal obvious exaggeration on my part ( I don't have any problem with periods, I know it's natural, and I think I have a perfectly acceptable and understanding attitude towards it). 

The girls FLIPPED. THEIR. SHIT. They started to bombard me with how much of a jerk and letdown I am, how I betrayed their trust (paraphrasing here) and the whole 9 yards. I told them that I think it is a private thing, something that doesn't have anything to do with me. For clarification, I always adjust our programs and everything when my girlfriend is on her period, and I obviously care about HER period and try to help her out whenever she needs it.

My colleague (34M) told me that I should apologize, since E told me because she trusts me, and probably wanted to avoid the awkward explanation on the side of the pool why she can't join us. However, my GF (23F) says that both E and C are drama queens and agrees with me 100%, just like my other, closest female friends (who is coincidentally also E).

In the end, E practically forced me to say sorry (despite I told her that I won't apologize, because I don't think I said anything horrible, or harsh, and I still think they blew it out of proportion), otherwise she would cancel the weekend on her part.

Later that night, my girlfriend was telling me how she went to the bathroom in the lobby, and there was this girl quietly crying. My girlfriend said she stayed for a little bit and comforted her. 

Now the reason I am really annoyed by this is because that girl had got into a *huge* argument with out boss (she was clearly in the wrong though).

Basically what happened was, our boss asked her to get him a tea bag from our coffee station.

Our boss just told her to go home for the day, and the other bosses (our boss‚Äôs peers) didn‚Äôt say anything. 

Obviously people talk, and pretty much everyone agrees that that girl was in the wrong. Sure none of us *like* having to do that stuff, but it rarely happens. 

Anyway so I guess the girl was crying in the lobby and when my girlfriend told me about what happened, I instantly recognized who she was talking about. 

I told my girlfriend that I really wish she hadn‚Äôt done that because I didn‚Äôt want it to somehow seem like I, by relation, was taking sides against my boss, especially considering that this girl was the one who started the whole conflict. 

My girlfriend says that regardless, it‚Äôs ‚Äúempathetic‚Äù to still try to comfort her then. Even once I‚Äôve explained everything, she still doesn‚Äôt think she did anything wrong. She said I‚Äôm being really cold about this. Am I the wrong one?

252,AITA for thinking a dog beach is not an acceptable place for a picnic?,600,Not the A-hole,90,hpdhy9,1594515804.0,"I live in a beach town that has a small dog beach. The only stretch of beach dogs are allowed unleashed is about 250 yards and dogs are only allowed Fri/Sat/Sun from 5pm to dusk.

Dogs must have a pass showing they are vaccinated and a park ranger checks the pass and signs tell you that you are entering the dog beach. 

We bring our dog as often as possible but ran into an issue this weekend. A family had an entire picnic spread out on the dog beach complete with big Italian hoagies, cheese trays, deli meats, chips, etc. This family had a dog but were upset that other dogs were smelling the food and approaching.

My dog is usually well behaved at the park but she is also a food crazy breed with a good nose. She never begs at the house but she got a sniff and was all over this family along with a couple other dogs.

I know I need to work on her training more as I'd go pull her away , run her down the beach only for her to return to the picnic.

A lady complained about the dogs common close to the food and I was just perplexed and argued with her about a picnic at a dog beach. I told her, ""would you take a picnic to a dog park?"" She argued it was different because they wanted to have a beach picnic with their dog.

I'll be honest, I was never all that curious where I came from since I always felt like I belonged. I never looked or had any interest in finding biological relatives.

Well, my birth mother found me and my wife and parents thought I ought to at least get to know her a bit. She's been searching for me for years and when we met it was supremely uncomfortable. She tried to hug me and cried a lot. Apparently I was taken from her against her will. She was 14 when she had me so it was her parents decision, and while I feel bad for her, I feel nothing for her. I don't feel like I was missing something. She's a stranger to me.

I've since ignored multiple calls and texts and have blocked her since I felt she was rather clingy. I just feel that she wants her son back, but I'm not her son, not really, nor do I want to be. I don't need or want her in my life, so she needs to move on.

My parents have stayed out of it, but it's led my wife and I to have some serious fights. She thinks I'm being cold and mean and my birth mother deserves some comfort from me. She thinks I ought to think about how I'd feel if one of our children was taken from us and we were reunited years later. I don't think thats the same thing at all since we were more than ready to have our children and could give them a great life.

When I found out I was pregnant I decided to buy a house as my apartment is a 1 bedroom and much too small. I found a building with 3 seperate apartments, which I planned to move into the 3 bedroom on the bottom floor.  I closed on the house in March and informed the tenant about my plans to move in. 

Because of covid I agreed to allow them to stay a few month's longer,  but now the covid in our area has subsided for the most part and business are opened back up.  

I wouldn't be in such a hurry except that I've had several complaints from neighbors and my other tenants about the property.  These people have at least 8 cars parked in the front of the house at a time, most of them unregistered and no inspection.  I received an Order to Remedy Violation from the town zoning officer.  And the entire yards looks like a scrap yard with all the car parts and tires laying around. One of my good tenants told me she plans to move if they aren't gone soon because she can't stand the ""ruckus"" that goes on every day.  

There are also repairs needed to the plumbing and windows in the basement that they are not allowing me to get to.

I feel like they are taking advantage of my kindness and my property. I know it's hard to find a place that quickly and move out but we don't have a lease and in my state I'm only required to give the 30 days.

I'm getting divorced after 13 years of marriage. High school sweethearts, young love, infidelity on my STBXH's part - the usual stuff. 

Our marriage hit a rough patch 7 years ago. He fell in love with his married co-worker. They decided to be together, yada yada. We were separated, like full on divorce papers filed, for about a year. She went back to her husband. Idiot me thought he realized his 'mistakes' and came back home. 

I started my hysterical bonding as soon as he moved back in with me. A few days later I found out I was pregnant. Obviously, I didn't think much of the drunken party night I had with my buddies. We were all absolutely hammered, and I woke up not remembering much the next day. So the fact that I hooked up with a guy friend from college in the club restroom completely vanished from my memories. 

So things are normal, I'm pregnant, we are happy. I give birth, we all are happy for 4 years. Then we find out that his co-worker finally did divorce her husband, and the next thing I know, we're getting divorced, AGAIN. Only this time it's permanent she's pregnant with my STBXH's baby. 

I never really liked her or had much of a choice in the situation. I obviously hated the idea of my kids being around her, but I had to suck it up. He's moving far away (5 hours) to be with her and ALSO pushing for 50/50 custody. I obviously put my foot down, and got labelled as 'controlling' when I suggested them looking for an apartment nearby. 

So one sunny afternoon at my childhood home, I pulled out my kindergarten yearbook and was going through the pictures, only to notice the distinct similarity between my guy friend's (we were also in kindergarten together) and my daughters' facial features. They had the same distinct ears. I was alarmed, looked him up on facebook, and sent a quick DM, asking about THAT drunken night 5 years ago. He confirmed that we did hook up, and that he didn't want to tell me about it later because I didn't remember anything. 

At this point, my heart was beating fast and I tell him everything, and send him pictures of my daughters. He calls me up immediately, and goes ""they are my babies and I'm gonna take care of them forever"". He wasn't mad, he apologized for not telling me about our 'hook up' all these years ago. 

He came down to meet my daughters (as a friend). His mother came along and confirmed that they looked exactly like his childhood self. 

Paternity tests come by, and he's the father. 

STBXH initially thought that it was my ploy to get custody and a fake set up. He's all over the place and not doing too well. He's accusing me of lying to him and killing a part of his soul.

My parents have always sat in on my appointments. It‚Äôs not necessary or advised that they do so, it‚Äôs just their preference.

Another reason I don‚Äôt want my parents in my consultations is that whenever I say something or ‚Äòcomplain‚Äô about anything (which is literally what I‚Äôm meant to do so that the doctors can determine whether it‚Äôs from my condition or something else), they either make faces, do the kick-thing to tell me to shut up, or verbally tell me.

When she first moved in we noticed some roaches and brought it up to the new roommate since we hadn't seen any before. She said she hadn't had a roach problem before, but would help. She cleaned bathroom, living room, and kitchen. We appreciated it, but since then has been cleaning a lot and seems to be frustrated with our cleanliness. These have been the following interactions:

""make sure you wipe the counter and rinse the dishes and vacuum before going to bed so there's nothing for the roaches"" 

""I'm fine with you eating on my coffee table, but could you clean up your dishes and wipe it down when you're done? there was a lot of sauce on the table and I stepped in a puddle of something on my rug"".

I have felt for some time that part of this is because she doesn't have a lot of social interaction in her life, and she hasn't been using her brain very much. She has been playing this stupid slot machine game all the time. There is nothing to this slot machine game other than staring at the screen and waiting for flashing lights and bells.

I recently started playing Animal Crossing New Horizon. I knew when I started playing it that it might appeal to her. I also knew she might get addicted to it. It's an addictive game anyway, and she has a history of addictive behavior, such as having a gambling problem in the past. Even though it doesn't have real social interaction, I hoped that the simulated interaction might help her. The game also does involve more thinking than just staring at the screen.

So, I bought my mom a Switch and the game, along with a couple of other puzzle games. Well, she did get addicted to it. She plays it all day and half the night. The thing is, I can definitely see that it is helping her mentally. She's sharper than she has been for a while. She's also started getting involved in the online communities and visiting other islands. 

The problem? She gets so wrapped up in it that she has basically stopped taking care of my dad (82 M). She has stopped cooking and has let a lot of the cleaning go, as well. He's upset that he's being neglected, and that I gave her the game knowing how she can become easily addicted to things. Some other family members also think its weird I gave her a ""kid"" game.

While the world has been going crazy due to the whole quarantine thing, we've been doing pretty well, and so we decided to talk about getting a dog. It's been something we've discussed before, I've only ever lived with cats and have always wanted a dog, because I like the idea of having a dog to run and play with and be active with, while my GF only ever had interactions with dogs through her grandmother, who kept a pair of a small dogs to keep her company.

&#x200B;

Now here's the problem, I've always wanted a more active breed, in fact I would love a breed like a husky (I know they can be a lot of work, but I want a dog I can exercise with), but my GF wants a lap dog like her grandmother had, in fact she has been talking about getting a Pomeranian (she says she's been in love with them ever since she saw Fran Drescher having one on The Nanny). I really do not want a small dog breed though, I have really zero interest in them, and my GF says she doesn't want a dog that will jump on her and be rowdy if we can't give it all the attention it needs.

&#x200B;

The issue is, neither of us really don't want to compromise, she wants her small dog, I want an active dog, and we have actually started to fight about it. Like just raising our voices, but still, it's probably been more heated than anything we've ever fought about before. She raises some good points, we live in an apartment right now, although there are plenty of parks and dog areas I could take a husky or athletic breed to so he wouldn't be cooped up, and I point out dogs are a 10+ year commitment, and we aren't planning on living in an apartment forever. She tries to argue that we could get her breed first to ease us into owning a dog, and then discuss getting a breed for me in a couple years ... but that just feels like she gets what she wants with a ""maybe"" I'll get what I want, plus again I honestly worry if we have a little dog then an active husky puppy down the road it could be too rough trying to play with the smaller one. ""We already have a small dog, a big dog would bully her"".

&#x200B;

I told her at one point if she got a lap dog then I wouldn't consider it ""my dog"" and wouldn't want to be responsible for it, and she got angry, saying I am being immature about it since it was supposed to be ""our dog"". I told her that if neither of us can compromise then maybe we aren't mature enough in our relationship for a dog then, and she got more angry. Now she's giving me the cold shoulder and talking about going to stay with her parents for awhile, but with the quarantine we might be stuck together and things have just gotten tense. I just feel like if we can't agree on a breed, then if we do get a dog, one of us will be resentful.

&#x200B;

AITA for refusing to compromise on getting a small dog, even though I don't want one? AITA for saying we aren't mature enough to share a dog since we can't agree?

&#x200B;

EDIT: So everyone seems to agree I'm TA for wanting a husky just because they ""look cool"", and I totally see everyone's point in that. I did some ""research"" initially, but mostly just searching online for ""things to know before you get a husky"" and lots of husky pictures (lol), but really, I was not actually prepared, and our apartment is most definitely not ready for one either. I did talk to my GF some, I admitted I was dumb for wanting a husky but I said I still think we should plan on waiting a couple more months on the dog thing. I did show you some pictures of a Jack Russel Terrier though since many of you guys have suggested one, and she said ""awww!"" so I think that's a good sign. Also mentioned adopting or even dog sitting instead of buying a puppy outright to start. We are not going to be moving forward on the dog right now but I think we are in a better place. I think we both were just being kinda bullheaded about what we wanted (and me painfully underinformed)! Thank you all for being informative furparents, even the ones who raked me over the coals for wanting a ""cool"" husky in my apartment, ha ha!

&#x200B;

Edit 2: So everyone is giving their opinions on their favorite breeds, and what is best for beginners, even people who originally said Russel Terriers would be a good option, others are saying they are headstrong and also very energetic. I can't reply to everyone, but I want to thank everyone! We are still going to wait awhile, and the suggestion some of you made to take in a dog temporarily through dog sitting is a great idea, but you guys have shown both of us (both me and my GF) that we have a lot more research to do. I really got hung up on wanting what I want, and sort of didn't think it through. There are so many awesome breeds you guys are suggesting! Although the more I hear about everyone talking about rescues, I am really personally leaning towards that and I'm pretty sure I can get my GF on board as well, thanks guys!",False,1594875453.0,2020-07-14 23:47:44

Sometime during all this, she asked why I wanted her to go. I explained to her that I wanted her to watch the kid for a bit while we did something a little dangerous. 
And all of a sudden she felt very used and started arguing so at that point I just said forget it and we will just wait for the kids mom. No harm no foul. 

I get ready to go out and leave her behind. She is crying in my bathroom but I had no time to deal with this. It‚Äôs a lot later than I wanted to be out but I had a mission to save my weekend. She calls on the phone. I tell her this isn‚Äôt the time but of course she has to talk it out. She keeps repeating that she feels very used. I don‚Äôt get it. She doesn‚Äôt understand why I don‚Äôt get it. 
I explain to her that, the only reason I want her to come is watch the kid. But we could‚Äôve made an evening of it. We could‚Äôve been together for a nice 30 min car ride together. We could‚Äôve after the job, gotten some desert or something and then another 30min car ride. Sounds pretty pleasant over just sitting on the couch. But nope she is completely hung up on being used just to watch the kid. I shut down for bit cause the convo is going no where and I just don‚Äôt understand why she is so upset. After about 30 mins of her repeating the same thing. I lose my shit, and start yelling. What the fuk are you so upset about? Nothing happened, you‚Äôre not even doing anything youre not even coming. You got upset, so I changed the plan. After a few mins of me yelling. She hung up and we haven‚Äôt spoke since Friday. 

I‚Äôm not gonna reach out. I don‚Äôt think what I did warranted the any of this. 

So he lives the question. Am I the asshole?

267,AITA for going to see my best friend alone because my girlfriend is too big to fly?,698,Not the A-hole,136,hrpyy2,1594856814.0,"I'm a passionate traveller living in Germany, and my best friend lives in the UK. We do visit each other at least once a year. Since I've never made it to the UK in summer, I looked up flights and found a really good and cheap offer in August this morning. I've been wanting to visit him so much since he had Corona and following pneumonia in April and I was scared to death about him, and his lovely dog suddenly passed away end of June from a seizure, feeling I need to be with him because of his history of depression.

I'm having a girlfriend for 4 weeks now.
I do really like her. Early on she told me that she can't/won't fly because of her weight of 180kg / 28 Stone. (And I think anxiety too.)

A couple of weeks ago she asked me about the time of my summer days off work and I told her (I've got 21 days off.) She said she has 14 days off in the same time and was happy we can see more often then. (We could see every day if we wanted, even while working because we live close by.) But no plans were made what to do or where to go during this time. So I forgot about it. I forget a lot, just saying.

So this morning I'm talking days off with my best friend and he said I can come visit whenever I want. I immediately messaged my girlfriend and asked her ""If I find flights to England to visit my best friend in August, will you come with me?"" She replied ""Rather not, I'm too fat. Sorry."" And I said ""Don't worry, babe, soon we'll be able to travel together."" (Since she keeps talking about losing weight so she is more mobile and can live ""unhindered"" as she calls it.)

So I booked 10 days vacation alone with my friend because it gave me the best value (lowest price and shortest travel and transfer time).
Excitedly I messaged my girlfriend about it and she's been crying since, how much I hurt her deciding my flight times on my own without her.

I was a bit surprised. I've asked her. No matter my flights, we still have 4 days in August or 6 days in September off at the same time (she still hasn't told me exactly when she has her days off)
She's currently in day hospital for psychiatry (I don't exactly know yet for what reasons, since I'm still just getting to know her) I think because of her weight, eating disorder, depression, insecurities, I think.

Don't get me wrong, I really like her. But I'm having a hard time understanding what hell of a mistake I made.

No, I won't cancel the flight. No, I won't allow her obesity to keep me from living my life. It's already ruining her life :(

Background:

My oldest brother is the golden child. Never does any wrong in my parents eyes. He was handed everything in his life and will get everything later on. He has also done everything my mom has told him to do, except marrying his (now) ex-wife. 

Brother and ex-wife, let's call her Stacy, met at parents business. She worked for us, and they started dating. Mom was not happy. Called her the every possible name in the book including sl*t because Stacy had a child out of wedlock - (insert sarcastic gasp). Welp, 2 kids and a marriage later, mom had no choice but to deal with it. 

10 years later, Stacy filed for divorce. In the 10+ years, my bro has stopped working or even helping their business. Left everything to Stacy to handle, plus the kids. He also went and spent lots and lots of money at failed ideas that other people loop him into. My brother is very book smart and very gullible and a little too nice so he got taken advantage a lot. Stacy finally had enough and said she has done everything to make it work, even putting up with the constant belittling, etc while making all the money for their family. 

Divorce took over 3 years. In the 3 years, my husband and I have tried to keep a neutral ground for the sake of our relationship with my nephews (including her oldest son) because 1. Not our divorce, not our business. 2. They're all kids.. kids are innocent. 

My parents already disowned me 2 years into the divorce process because Stacy brought the kids over to visit us for Christmas. Dad's exact words to me -""if you choose her, then you were never my daughter.""

Obviously that got better and I was accepted back into the family, lol.

Divorce is now finalized (2020) and he didnt get what he and my mom thought he deserved. Nephews wanted to come visit us for a week for summer vacation and Stacy was up for driving them over to see us (6+ hour one way). 

Of course we said yes! My husband loves all the nephews, including her oldest son. 

Anywho, parents and brother found out. My mom said to me, ""everyone has choices to make. You made your choice and if that's the case, then don't bother calling me."" 

Brother followed with deleting me and blocking me from WeChat (Chinese messaging app).

My dad has ignored my phone calls, video calls, and voice messages.

She wanted to help out with household expenses more so she started working as an in-home assistant for her mother. She's paid to do this but it's not much (about 1/3 what I make) and it's part-time. I don't mind any of that. A few nights ago we were getting ready for bed as it was quite late and she decided she wanted to have a tickle fight. I gently reminded her that she needs to get some sleep as she hasn't been sleeping well lately. She pouted some and then went right back to it. I reminded her again and then she got upset. She said I was boring and she just wanted to have fun with me. I explained that I just wanted to make sure she got enough sleep for work the next day. She's been somewhat cold to me since then but I really do want to make sure she gets her rest. AITA for suggesting she calm down and sleep?

&#x200B;

Info: I work full-time from home and will be doing so for the forseeable future. I wake first and prepare things such as coffee and breakfast, tend to the dogs, etc. If she did this at a more reasonable hour I'd be 110% down because I am a tickle master. 12:30am, 1am? I'm sorry but that's a bit late to be doing this.

She's complained that she has trouble staying awake at work at times due to her getting used to working again and waking up earlier than she was accustomed to. She hasn't lashed out at me or the kids as a result of being tired but I can see it dragging on her.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: So it would seem the consensus is I am TA for treating her as a child with reminding her she needs to get some sleep. I can agree with this assessment and I thank all those for their insights. To those who suggested it'd lead to smexy time... It rarely does, we have other activities that lead to a good romp. We've talked about it and agreed to just let each other do. If she's sleepy the next day, well, that's on her. We've also been working on helping her stay asleep as that's also been an issue. The fix seems to be keeping our bedroom as cold as we can is a major factor. We live in South Texas and the central in our home isn't as good as it can be.

272,AITA for refusing to wait for the person in front of me at the grocery check out to finish shopping?,507,Not the A-hole,79,hpzcwg,1594607587.0,"I am a regular Aldi shopper. One of my favorite aspects of Aldi is how much time I can save on my weekly grocery shopping. The store is relatively small with limited options for each item, so it‚Äôs easy to navigate through the whole store in fifteen minutes. Check out also moves very quickly because there are no baggers, and the cashier just places your purchased items in the cart for you to bag yourself.

Last weekend as I was approaching the line to check out, a woman followed by a man filed into line just ahead of me. The woman did not have a cart, and had piled all her items into reusable grocery bags as she shopped. This normally doesn‚Äôt cause an issue if you have a small order and the cashier will place the items in your bag. This woman had four bags full, though. 

As the cashier was finishing up checking out the customer in front of the woman, the woman dropped her bags in her spot in line and went to the front of the store to grab a cart. When she came back with the cart, the previous customer had already finished checking out, and the conveyor belt was empty. 

The woman picked up her bags,  put them in the cart, and then asked the cashier where a couple items were in the store. The cashier told her, and the woman backed her cart up and let the man in front of me go ahead while she went to retrieve the items she had just asked about. 

The man had a relatively small cartload, so he unloads, and the cashier checks him out in about a minute or two. While the cashier was checking the man out, I was looking to see if the woman was on her way back. 

Once the man was checked out and the conveyer belt was agin empty,  the woman was nowhere to be seen. I moved the woman‚Äôs cart back, pulled ahead, and started unloading my cart. When I was about halfway through unloading cart, the woman comes back. 

She says to me ‚Äúexcuse me, I was in line.‚Äù I told her that she was not in line as she clearly hadn‚Äôt finished shopping and that she had caused the line to stop twice by making everyone wait for her to make her moves. She said ‚Äúwell, I let the man behind me go ahead, but  I didn‚Äôt let you go ahead of me.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what makes you think you‚Äôre so important that you can make the whole line wait for you, but you weren‚Äôt ready, and the man in front of you had been checked out,‚Äù and continued unloading my items.

At this point another cashier opened a new checkout lane and says she can help the next customer. The woman looks at me, and then tells the woman behind her that she can go ahead of her in the new line. This seemed like an effort to save face with everyone in line, but it also made me feel like an asshole for refusing to wait.

Some background:
I‚Äôm 23 and aside from being 5-10 pounds overweight, I look relatively healthy. However, I‚Äôve been having health problems for almost a year, and no one can figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me. I‚Äôm in constant pain, with flares of more intense pain. Sitting down is painful. Standing up is painful. Hell, sometimes it‚Äôll come out of nowhere and I‚Äôll be in pain just sitting at my desk. None of this is obvious, but a few of my coworkers (including the one in question - let‚Äôs call her May) are aware that I‚Äôm sick.

Two weeks ago I had surgery (which turned up nothing), and I was called back into work a week early (shout out for the American healthcare system!). I was in a lot of pain on top of my regularly scheduled pain, but I also had painkillers that I was taking round the clock. We don‚Äôt have any employees using a wheelchair or with any obvious disabilities, so I started using the handicapped stall in the women‚Äôs bathroom. I know some people have a preference for that stall, but May was waiting in the bathroom for me (the rest of the stalls were open). 

She was upset and told me I needed to ‚Äúbe more respectful of my elders‚Äù. According to May, because I‚Äôm young and have painkillers, I‚Äôm going to be fine, and that even if I‚Äôm sick older people still need that stall more than I do. Now, May is definitely not elderly. In fact, I‚Äôd be shocked if May is more than 40 at the absolute oldest, and by her own admission has no serious health issues (it‚Äôs come up when talking about how my diagnosis is going). She‚Äôs said that sometimes her knee hurts, and that combined with being older than me gives her more of a right to the handicapped stall, I guess.

So, when I had my kid, all I heard from her was this and that trait are from the ""Boren Clan."" It wasn't ""Oh, look, THIS, just like dad"" or ""THIS, just like mom.""

I (25F) am a stay at home mom. My husband (29M) works a regular job. He refuses to wake up in the morning with our daughter or really help take care of her at all.

Our daughter is under a year old and requires a lot of attention and care. My husband works a regular job that gives him two days off a week. He also usually gets off early two days a week. I usually look forward to days that he is off work so that I can have a little help with our daughter, but this is not the case 95% of the time. 

This is how a normal day goes, daughter wakes up at 6:30am. I‚Äôm always the one to get up with her while my husband sleeps till 9 because he has to be at work by 10. He gets up and rushes out the door hardly having time to say good morning or spend anytime with us. He goes to work and calls me on his break never stopping to ask how my day is going or how our daughter is. I‚Äôll send him pics during the day of her without getting much of a response from him. 

When he gets off work he expects dinner to be on the table. After dinner he will spend maybe an hour if I‚Äôm lucky with our daughter. Mind you the whole time that he is holding her or playing he makes sure that I‚Äôm there. It‚Äôs very rare that I can step away for alone time or to even take a shower. Then he usually goes to play his video game while I have the bath and get the baby to bed. 

On his off days he won‚Äôt wake up with her at all. He will sleep in till 11 or 12 even with me begging for him to just give me an extra hour of sleep. He won‚Äôt watch her while I go to the grocery store and if I do convince him to watch her, he will call me like every 20mins asking when I will be home. So outings alone are usually not enjoyable. He also will not change diapers. I can count on one hand how many diapers he has changed since she was born. 

I‚Äôve become overly frustrated about this and have tired to have a conversation about it. It usually ends in an argument and him telling me that my ‚Äúrole‚Äù as a stay at home mom is to take care of her and his is to go to work everyday. So in his eyes he is doing nothing wrong.

I know the title sounds bad, but first, a timeline of events:

Basically, I have this family friend, she's about 12-13 years older than me, but I've known her since I was about 9 (I am now 20), as she was my cousin's nanny. I ended up bonding with her because my siblings and my cousins are a lot younger than me, and I had nobody else to talk to. We've kept contact all these years, although not as much as when we lived close to each other.

About 4 years ago she got married to this guy she had been dating for a while, who is a year or so older than her, and everybody loved him. My family really liked him, I thought he was a super cool guy myself

About two years ago, I was 18 and had moved out on my own, and was starting my first college semester. One night her husband messaged me through social media, asking how life was going, and all that. I still saw him as a cool guy, and a family friend at this point, so I gladly kept the conversation going. 

But then it got weird, he started asking me about how I lost my virginity, how I ""handled things"" when I was single and all sorts of weird stuff, complaining about how his wife didn't satisfy him etc. I basically freaked out and just stopped answering, ignored him and tried to forget this even happened. I wanted to tell her, but I was scared to ruin her marriage, and that I wouldn't be taken seriously. I took screenshots of the conversation, but I ended up losing them after switching phones so many times.

This is where I'm wondering if IWBTA. 

Today I got a message from him again, first time since that incident. He just messaged me calling me by my nickname. I am currently 20, and he is in his mid 30's. Just the way he said it, and because of our last interaction, this really rubbed me the wrong way.

My first instinct was to say hi, and see where he steers the conversation this time, before informing him that I don't agree with how he's been going behind her back like this, as well as collecting proof of it happening before talking to her. 

I already feel guilty that I didn't trust myself enough to say anything to her the last time it happened, and this time it seems even worse to me, because a few weeks ago she just announced that they're expecting their first child together. However, I don't want to bring this up without proof. I really care about her and I don't want her to get hurt, although that may be inevitable at this point.

WIBTA to do this? It's all so fresh I can't think of another way to go about this. There's also the possibility that he won't even take the conversation that direction, but I still feel guilty about when it did happen 2 years ago.",False,False,2020-07-15 05:56:39

Background: 
Granny is slightly anti-vax, meaning she doesn't want to get vaccinations because she thinks it's a waste of time and money and they don't do anything. She also is quite often sick with common illnesses, (cold, flu etc.) 
At the end of May I gave birth and now said baby is 5wks old, so she is too young to be vaccinated. 
I also have a 2yro boy with respiratory issues.

Every Sunday night my little family (4) go to my parents house for dinner. My Granny is also invited. While we're there both my kids are passed around and played with. My Granny is obsessed with my daughter and holds her most of the night. All is well. 
The next day I get a text from Granny telling me that she went to the DR and has Shingles. (kind of like adult chickenpox) 
I was upset as my infant was with her and possibly exposed to this disease which, if contracted, can be fatal.

I replied

""I wish you had said something yesterday when you had her. That's very irresponsible and dangerous. If she contacted chicken pox it could be fatal to her.""

I then get a phonecall from my mother saying I need to cut my Granny some slack and I'm being rude. Apparently my Granny had told my mother what I had said. I didn't back down and was furious that my mother didn't see my point of view that this is a repeated offence and  not the first time my Granny has hidden or lied about being ill to visit my children.

She then lied about leaving the house saying she didn't go anywhere but my aunty, who lives with her, dobbed her in to keep my 2yo son and pregnant me safe.)

Those last 2 months of pregnancy were horrible. People congratulating me while I already knew he'd die. But I think it also helped me, because I had time to get it in my head my son would not live.

When he was born I held him in my arms, cried, but knew I had to let go. My absolutely wonderful friend took pictures of me and my baby, giving me a wonderful memento to him. 

Grieving him was...hard, but bearable knowing he never had the chance to live. I know this sounds awful, but I just wanted people to let me forget. I feel like I became like this pariah, the ""woman who lost a child"" and my family, coworkers and some friends treated me differently. I just wanted to be normal. People were also asking if I'd try again, but at that time this was not something on my mind. This all strained my relationship with my boyfriend, and 2 years after we decided to separate.

I wanted out. I was fortunate to find a temporary job abroad, and took it. Then six months after that, I moved to yet another country where I met my current husband.

I started over and did not tell anyone about my dead baby. Not my colleagues, not my new friends, not even my husband. 

We were getting an ultrasound and the technician asked me if it was my first pregnancy and without even thinking I said no. Well of course this all came flooding.

He is very upset that I did not tell him. First because I think he's not robbed of the illusion it's 'our first child', but also because he feels this was something  this was something fundamental about me and he wanted me to confide in him. He said he wished he would have known so he could have ""acted accordingly"" for whatever that means. But this is exactly the reason I didn't say. I don't want people to 'act accordingly'. I don't want to be forever branded as the mother of a dead baby and tiptoed around.

I have a 19 year old son who goes to college out of state. He has a girlfriend who goes to his school and she doesn't live in the same state as us so they don't see each other too much when school is out. I met her once over winter break and she seemed fine, a little quite and awkward, but I didn't have a problem with her.

Well they hadn't seen each other in months because of covid and he wanted her to come and visit for a week. I was fine with this and the first three days went well. Last night I had a few people over and people were drinking (I don't care if my son drinks as long as he is in the house and responsible) At around midnight they were hungry and she was going to make pancakes. I guess while she was cooking he thought it would be funny to break one of the eggs in her hair.

She went ballistic. She screamed at him and she ended up calling the police. They did send out an officer, who seemed pissed to be there and my husband had to talk to him since we are the homeowners. The police officer pretty much said she was wasting his time and left. I told her how stupid it was and my husband said she needed to leave in the morning because she has terrible judgment and we don't want her in our house.

She did leave this morning and I told my son she is not welcome back. Now maybe if they get married in five years or something I might reevaluate but my son thinks I'm being unfair.",False,False,2020-07-15 17:41:19

Early this morning there was a little scare in town because there was a bear near people houses. This isn‚Äôt a totally uncommon occurrence. Last summer alone we had at least 3 other similar incidences.

Without my knowledge my brother and his wife had decided they wanted to expand their home. So they demoed some walls and now one hole side of their house is opened up. They thought they‚Äôd be fine with just a tarp since it‚Äôs warm at night, but the bear freaked them out. 

Now they want to stay with me with their two kids in a 1 bedroom apartment for the 2-3 months it will take them to finish construction. Their kids our young and go to bed early so I can‚Äôt see it working out without me having to give up my bedroom. It would also complicate me being able to see my bf because we can‚Äôt exactly get privacy at his place either.

The only hotel in our town is a small family owned inn and it looks like they are staying closed, so their only other option is a hotel that is 2 hours away. 

They say they can‚Äôt do that because it would be really expensive for such a long stay and because the time lost from the commute everyday would mean their construction would be even further delayed costing them even more.",False,False,2020-07-14 01:59:01

Due to health problems I can't work and have to stay living at home with my parents, which I am incredibly grateful for. I love my mother and she doesn't mean badly. She suffers with anxiety.

However! A while ago I had a medication review and, afterwards, my mother asked me what meds I had been prescribed. Not thinking anything of it, I told her.

She then went away and Googled the names of my medications when I wasn't there, looking up the side effects and such. From there, she concluded (wrongly) that I could not drink a drop of alcohol - and that it was her business as to whether I did or not. Examples of her actions since include hiding any alcohol in the house, fretting and questioning me over my (practically nonexistent) drinking habits, and, while we were guests at a relative's house, crossing the room to stop me after I was offered a glass of wine. She hasn't listened when I've become annoyed or tried to correct her.

I am angry about this, but there is an element of built-up resentment there - I suffered badly in my teens and my mother neither noticed nor tried to get me medical help. And, now that I am grown up and my medical history is my own business, she has decided that this is the time to be concerned.

283,AITA for rejecting my nieces offer of paying rent rather than continuing to be our nanny?,465,Not the A-hole,145,hq38r9,1594620914.0,"So, this whole thing started about a year ago when our previous nanny quit. She needed to move back home to take care of her sick mother. That put us in a bit of a pickle as she gave us only 2 weeks‚Äô notice. Finding a nanny that fits in with our family and lifestyle is not something that‚Äôs done in 2 weeks.

Fortunately for us, my niece was moving to our city to start collage around that same time. We reached out to her to offer her the position. She gleefully accepted and we worked with her to come up with the contract. 

I am anticipating that people will ask so to get it out of the way‚Ä¶ she makes $15/hour and works 44 hours a week. There isn‚Äôt anything special about her contract. It is virtually identical to our previous nanny except for lower pay, which reflects her lack of experience. 

My niece‚Äôs schooling is only part time and quite flexible so she was able to arrange all her classes to be in the evenings. She also has weekends off and vacation days.

Anyways, last night Niece asked my husband and I for a meeting. She told us that she no longer wants to work as our nanny.

She said she would like to continue living with us and, instead of working, pay full rent. I told her very gently that we can‚Äôt accept that offer. The fact is‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt need money; we need a nanny. If she is not the nanny, but still lives in the nanny suite, we would have nowhere to put our new nanny.

She was quite put out by this and suggested that we use her rent to hire a live-out nanny. This isn‚Äôt something we are willing to do. We want a live-in nanny, that is what works for our kids and for us. She debated us for a while but we held firm. The only options for her are to continue her employment or move out. We wouldn‚Äôt kick her out to be clear, she would have the required 30 days‚Äô notice to find accommodations.

She told us that she needed some time to think and we said no problem. I didn‚Äôt think we handled it poorly until earlier today when I got a call from my sister (her mother). She absolutely reamed me out for not being more willing to work with her daughter. She brought up the point that there is very poor availability for housing in our area (true) and niece would never find a place in her budget. I suggested she move home, her classes are all online anyways, but niece has a boyfriend and close friend group here in the city that she is apparently unwilling to leave.

I am now conflicted if I am an ‚Äúasshole‚Äù here. My sister honestly made me feel pretty bad about the whole thing. My husband of course agrees with me. So please tell me if I was wrong to reject her offer like that?

That was until recently when my buddy's younger sister (who is friends with my sister) showed me a video of her vaping and it was in her room.  I usually wouldn't care but she has asthma and there is no what that is good or safe for her.  I wasn't gonna go tell on her cause thats dumb but she shouldn't be vaping at all.  

When I got home, I went to my sister's room and asked her if she had a vape she didn't answer me right away but soon let me in and showed me it.  I asked her first if she was having trouble breathing and she did admit that she did and that she doesn't even like the stupid thing and I can just have it.  I asked her if she was serious and she seemed like she was when she said yeah.  I then snapped the thing in half and said ""vaping is bad, especially with you asthma.  Not a good mix"".  

My sister got flaming pissed, she yelled at me to get out of her room and was practically shoving me out before calling me a dick.

285,Aita for not letting my daughter go on her 18th bday trip (in december),467,Everyone Sucks,274,hpau13,1594506322.0,"Some context is required for this issue. My daughter  (17F) and her friends planned a trip to go to Japan during her Christmas break to celebrate her 18th birthday. She had been planning this for the last 2 years.
I decided as her present, I would pay for all her expenses (flights, hotel, activities etc).

Moving onto the incident, I have an autistic 9 year old son. Quarantine has been really hard for him, and he's been struggling a lot.
One thing he loves to do is jigsaw puzzles. We decided to get him 10,000 piece jigsaw as a small gift for him to complete.
He has a table in his room in which he laid everything out and spent almost a month on this puzzle.
A few days ago, he completed the puzzle and was just so happy and poud of himself. He facetimed his grandparents and other relatives just to show them his hard work.

Anyways, later during the day I hear him scream and I rush upstairs to see him bent over his puzzle which was now in pieces on the floor, and my daughter filming on her phone.
Long story short is that there is a tiktok trend of siblings throwing jigsaw puzzles on the floor. My daughter decided to film one, and went into his room and shoved the puzzle off his desk and recorded his reaction.

My son was inconsolable and it took us almost 3 hours to calm him down. However he is still so upset. I was furious with my daughter and we had a long talk. No matter what excuse she gives, her actions were complete malicious. She did apologise to her brother. However I don't understand what positive outcome she saw from this. 

After some time I decided her punishment would be that she would not be allowed to go on this trip. I told her that I would not pay for her trip and cancelled her flight and hotel reservations. She started crying and begging me to reconsider, but I told her that I already cancelled everything. I told she was too old for this type of horrible behaviour and she had to deal with the consequences of her actions.

She  packed her stuff and left to her mothers house (my ex-wife). I later got a call from her mother saying, that I was a horrible parent and that my punishment was just an overreaction. 

I'm starting to think maybe I did over-react considering she had been begging for a girls trip for the past 2 years. Yet she decided a few like was more important than her brothers feelings.

He‚Äôs done nothing but tell about everything being gone and about how she keeps packing things we need.

Well today was moving day and i woke up at 4 and have been working for 6 hours (everyone has). I started to get annoyed with my brothers attitude again and we got in a yelling match that ended with him saying he helped more then I did. I look towards my mom who has just said to me in private that I have helped more for reassures and she says she won‚Äôt but in. Whatever. My feelings are hurt but it‚Äôs whatever. 

Eventually I get back to moving stuff and I grab a load a bit to big for me. I‚Äôm struggling to get down the three flights of stairs and my mom sees that and comments. I get to the last flight of stairs and my brothers are on their way up the stairs to grab another load (they haven‚Äôt even stepped into the first step yet but are about to.) I yell repeatedly to hold on because I‚Äôm almost down but they ignore me and pushed past me. I almost dropped my load. He continued to do the same thing to my mom. When I complained to my mom she said it was a dick move but she asked him to stop and he said no so there is nothing she can do about it. She told me to deal with it myself so I confronted my brother on it. He told me I was just being lazy and he‚Äôd rather me not help at all. Since my mother now considers him the authority since he can just tell her no I did exactly as he asked and told my mom I was done. She started screaming at me that I was throwing a tantrum. 
Fast forward to in the car. I went with mom alone and we talked. She told me he doesn‚Äôt listen so there is nothing she can do. We started yelling, she brake checked me and told me to get out and walk home. So here I am waiting for a ride to get me wondering if I should‚Äôve just let it go and moved on.

I told her how me and my husband really didn‚Äôt want to move because we had just moved and finally gotten settled in our new place and the apartments in that area were much more expensive.

So my mom brought up how my sister learned through her church that there is a private religious school nearby and that‚Äôs where her daughter was going. My mom said she had looked it up and they do not actually require you to be part of their religion. My sister and her family are religious, but me and my family are not.

I did some more research and found out it‚Äôs a really good school, really progressive, and they do not push religion on the kids. Back in December my husband and I visited and sat in on one of the kindergarten classes. It had a lot lower student to teacher ratio and they were very enthusiastically involved. I‚Äôve even talked to some other parents with non religious backgrounds that have kids going there and they also said they were wary at first, but it turned out to be really great.

I wasn't there for them when they were younger, since I had to put a few jobs in, but now we are better so I have been trying to get to know them better.

They (17 F & 17M)  both have the same friend group, same school, same extra activities, and hang out together too.

That being said, they tell eachother eveything. If I had to find out something about one of them, I just have to ask the other.

It's creepy sometimes.

Anyway, recently I've taken my son fishing, even signed him up for soccer etc. 

Not my daughter, I thought she wouldn't want to go. But my she asked why I'm not taking her and I told her that I have just been wanting to make up for some lost time with my son. She said then I should take her too, and that if he gets to have soccer why can't she do some archery or something. 

I said I knew she wouldn't like it, so I didn't bother to ask. Anyway she let it go and let me and my son go spend some time together.

Then a few days ago we hung out again and my daughter confided when I came back and she wants to learn fencing after the whole pandemic. 

She used the argument that fencing has many good benefits and it's totally safe. I told her that it's going to be a waste of time, and that there's no point in doing it and to concentrate on her swimming. We have a pool.

Note- The twins both do swimming and skating, but my son has been doing soccer. Social distancing of course and only in a small course. Since they can't go swimming outside, they've taken to practicing in the pool.

She kept arguing saying that if her brother gets to do soccer why can't she do somehting of her liking. Again it turned into a fight and she accused me of liking my son better. I love them both, but she won't like doing the things me and my son do. 

I told her she isn't entitled to learn any of this. Again she told me that I'm being bias here and my son found out and they were both mad at me, but then I agreed to do it, because my son did put in a fine argument for his sister.

AND THEN:

My daughter wasn't happy and told me that I only did it to please her brother. It's not my fault my son can put up a nice argument, and she told me that her brother used the same argument as her and ""I'm bias and sexist and should have gave her away to someone else because it's obvious I have a dream kid already."" Maybe my son did say the same things she said but it's easier to agree when it's not a big fight. They are both good academicly, physically , and socially, and I think she's being a little overboard because I have nothing to complain about besides my daughters attitude here.

They're both still mad at me.

We gave the bride and groom over 2 weeks notice; basically the day we broke up so we wouldn‚Äôt have foreseen and notify them any earlier. These are the texts we received tonight
-Hey man, so I totally get it that you‚Äôre unable to attend and I hope it doesn‚Äôt sound like a being a dick or anything but we just got confirmation from the venue that we have to pay for all the guests we already reported... so hopefully you‚Äôre all good with still paying for the plates since it was so last minute :)

I feel so bad about the situation you are in but unfortunately we can‚Äôt afford to pay for the two plate ... if only we knew more than a week in advance or so it would have been different .

It started with her dropping not so subtle hints about things she might like. Most were coming in at around a few thousands dollars, so they weren't cheap. I mostly ignored her hints or tried to change the conversation. I refused to have that conversation with her because I thought, and still think, the whole idea is ridiculous.

When she saw that her hints were not working, she got more direct and asked me if I had chosen something already or if I was still deciding. That is when I told her I wasn't getting her anything for giving birth. Her gift will be a (fingers crossed) healthy child.

She told me that I ""had"" to get her something because this is what people do now and said that she would feel unappreciated if I didn't acknowledge her childbirth experience with a gift and I would be embarrassing her in front of her friends and family. I said that people may do it but it's stupid and did she really want me to buy my baby from her, because that is what this really looks like to me. I told her that while I appreciated everything she had sacrificed to bring our child into this world and knew giving birth was not going to be easy what she was asking was unfair. Why I am supposed to buy her something for a baby we jointly decided to create? Should I expect a gift too? None of it makes any sense.

She thinks I am a stubborn asshole for refusing to acknowledge her by buying a push present. I am also an asshole, according to her, because I make more than her friends' husbands and should be more willing to buy a push present because I can afford it.

The only reason why I am even writing is because I've never felt like my wife was greedy or unreasonable. This is the first time I can ever remember really thinking she is out of line with her expectations, so it does have me wondering if I might be the asshole and not realize it.

I'm on mobile so I'm sorry if the formatting is off.

I'm a FTM and I gave birth to a healthy baby girl on April 30th of this year. My fianc√© will be together for 4 years this coming August and we just got engaged this past Christmas.

Here's a little background between his mom and I; His mom has never really liked me from the get go. She thought it was funny to call me the wrong name (I guess I reminded her of her cousins girlfriend at the time) so she kept calling me by the wrong name or referred to me as ""the girlfriend"". When we first met the first thing she asked me was ""are you scared of meeting me?"" I replied that I was a little nervous, but not really scared, and she just laughed. She has always been passive aggressive to me and I've always been nice and respectful, so I have no idea why she's been this way towards me. Last August I found out I was pregnant and he told his mom when I was only 7.5 weeks along and she wanted to post it on Facebook BEFORE I had announced it, I said absolutely not. I was waiting until I was out of my first trimester before announcing it to anyone that was not immediate family or close friends. My fianc√© and I were together for 3 years, but as soon as she found out I was pregnant, she decided to add me on Facebook. Also, for the baby shower she planned, she invited a lot of people that I didn't know and haven't met before because the baby shower was more for her than me.

She's met my daughter once, when she was 4 weeks old, we brought her over to her house and we stayed outside because she has SEVEN weiner dogs and I didn't feel comfortable having her inside with all of the dogs barking. I thought we were having a nice time. His mom took a bunch of pictures of her, but made sure I was cropped out in any with me holding her, but posted a lot of my fianc√© holding her. She also steals ant picture I post of my daughter on Facebook and uploads them on hers. I was a little upset because she saved the pictures I posted onto her phone and then uploaded them as if they were hers, with no mention of me whatsoever. I have tried forming a relationship with her; texting her while I was pregnant, sending her Snapchats of my daughter, ect. but she doesn't really respond back. It feels as though she doesn't see me as HER granddaughters mother, that I'm still just some girl her son is dating and eventually will get rid of.

I text the husband asking for help to stop his crazy wife and he had nothing nice to say to me. Even threatened to send the nudes to my family himself. 

I had enough and didn‚Äôt know what else to do. It may have been petty of me but after she revealed she got all my info from a cop (and gave that info back to me to prove it) I did internet snooping and found the FIL  found out about their church involvement.

I sent all the mean things she said  and he said to me to her INLaws/ his parents. The guys parents are big members in church and apparently so is the couple.

My mom expressed how uncomfortable this made her, so I explained to MIL that my mom feels very intimidated and maybe she could wear a cover up when she isn't in the water.

I‚Äôm not super close to my step-brothers just due to not seeing them much.

The 12 year old is autistic, but he is somewhat verbal and typically a good kid, but very quiet. However, he has bad moments too, especially in crowds or with loud noises. The meltdowns can be bad; screaming, crying, saying nonsense. Step-mom babies have a lot and he‚Äôs very sheltered, and usually gets what he wants/is accommodated very fast. The 10 year old is a nightmare child. He is a whirlwind of destruction. Because his mom is usually preoccupied with his older brother‚Äôs needs so he gets away with being bad and has minimal punishment. He does stuff without asking and is disrespectful. He throws tantrums when he doesn‚Äôt get what he wants or has to face consequences (he‚Äôs the type of kid who has to get a gift on OTHER people‚Äôs birthdays cause he‚Äôs jealous). He loves any attention he can get.

I‚Äôve looked after them ones when my dad first married her, but never again. It was awful. They don‚Äôt listen to anyone but their mom, and even then she doesn‚Äôt like to be ‚Äúmean‚Äù. I‚Äôm surprised my dad puts up with it at all, based on my own childhood.

The other night, I visited her with my girlfriend for a couple of drinks. On the way there, I warned my new girlfriend that he's quite an aggressive person in the way that he speaks, his body language etc, but that he will play it off as banter. I explained I hated him since he shouted ""You're a f\*cking c\*nt!"" close to his gfs face, outside in the rain as we were leaving her dad's bday.

My gf revealed that she had been in a man's house without her consent before and I felt very sad for her and mindful of her safety.

We get there. Later, outside in the yard, the BF was trying to light a fire in the fire pit. He clearly had not a single clue what he was doing. My gf is really good at making fires and she told him how not to smother the fire with the ash and he told her to do it.

About an hour and a few drinks later, we went outside again. On the way, he grabbed my neck from behind with his arm, which kinda clotheslined me and I felt my throat click. Super heavy handed. He pulled me towards him and did a short, clumsy kiss on the ear/neck area then let me go. Split second. I ignored him as usual.

We went outside. Gf crouched down and tended to the fire. She was between me and the back door. He went in to get his drink, came back out, lit a cigarette and proceeded to put his hand on her head while she was crouched, moving his fingers up and down through her hair as though massaging her scalp and said ""aww, my little firestarter.""

Her hair is long, soft, curled and pink. She's really pretty. I filled with rage but I kept stoic and still. I said, ""Get your hand off her now."" He looked at me with his hand still on her. She realised what was happening and said ""get your hand off me please"".

He still hadn't removed it (seconds passed) so I said firmly ""Get your hand off her"" -he did- ""You don't f\*cking touch her ever again.""

He said ""What the fuck!"" with confused dark eyes and stormed inside, locking us out. His gf had to walk around the street to let us in. During, his cousin said she's already tried to help. I remained calm and called a taxi home.

Later, I msgd explaining that I am not going to be around him anymore. She didn't reply then, but replied today explaining that she's confused as to what happened. She asked who it was who was ""actually offended"", me or my gf; that she doesn't see what he did wrong and suggests I'm clouded by the fact I don't like him; that we're completely opposite and she knows that, but she loves him for ""so many reasons""; that he ""is who he is"" and that the way they speak to each other is ""their behaviour"" and that if I'm offended by it, then it's on me and that she isn't sure how to move forward because she has no intention of leaving him so gave me the ultimatum - learn to get on with him or we can't see each other.

Td;lr Partner ignored what I'd told him about our sons bedtime routine, said he'd deal with our son getting out of bed, then moaned when I didn't help out. 

Partner (P) and I have a son (2)(S)who has recently gone through a major sleep regression that has lasted roughly 6 weeks. S's finally worked through it and we're establishing a normal routine again. I've been doing a lot of the bedtimes due to P's shift patterns, and the bedtime routine I have takes about half an hour, which gives S enough time to wind down properly, and I normally don't hear a peep after I leave his room. I've also learnt not to put S down too early, as becomes a jack in to box! A few nights I had to sit outside his room until I was sure S was asleep. I've been telling P about all of this as well, when we've discussed our days. 

P's shift pattern has changed this week, so he was home a lot earlier. I'm self employed, and tend to work around P's shifts and S's nap times, but during the six weeks of hell I got slightly behind due to S refusing to nap, so I thought I'd use the time to catch up a little. P was fine with this, and was looking forward to doing bedtime. I went into my office, put my headphone on, and cracked on for a couple of hours.

I finished up in time to give S a goodnight kiss and cuddle, and P took him up. He was downstairs again within about 10 minutes. When I asked him if everything was OK, he said ""yep, S's in bed, everything's fine."" I was a bit surprised, and told P that I didn't think he'd given S enough time to wind down, and it was early compared to his normal bedtime. P brushed it of, stating ""it'll be fine"", but agreed to put S back into bed if he got out.

So I put my headphones in, opened my book, and let him deal with it. Every 5 minutes P was going upstairs to put S back into bed. After about half an hour, I asked P to stay upstairs until he was sure S was asleep, telling him that S was far likelier to stay in bed. 

After a bit P came back down as all was quiet, and grumbled that I should have reiterated S's bedtime routine before starting work, and that I could have ""tagged in"" a couple of times. I responded with the fact that I've already told him a few times, plus I have had to deal with, and figure this out, on my own. He did acknowledge this and said he should've paid more attention.

He took the plunge, and is now doing well. It's getting to the point where he is recognised in the media- including interviews on network television and news websites. 

Today was his first live TV appearance. He let all his friends and family know he was going to be on, and I made sure to take 15 minutes off from work to watch live. It was one of those moments where you get that warm and fuzzy feeling of pride. 

Anyway, on a side note, covid has really hit my business hard over the past few months. Really hard. I've lost most of my projects due to shut down, and I have taken four casual contract jobs, to try and make ends meet, as I have a family to support. I tend to work 12-15 hours a day, with few (if any)  breaks, and barely get to see my wife and kids. I often have missed phone calls from family and friends at the end of the day, as I don't take personal calls while working, and there just aren't enough hours in the day to call everyone back- but I'll often send messages in reply.

Today, being Friday, I was fortunate enough to finish work at a decent hour. I walked through the door, kissed my wife and kids, and sat at the table for dinner. The kids were excited about seeing their uncle on TV, and we spoke about it and their day over dinner. Then I received the text message from my brother...

In short, my brother is angry/disappointed that I didn't call him to congratulate him on his TV appearance today when all his friends and the rest of the family have done so. He told me that he hoped I would be ""at the front of the line"" to congratulate him, because ""today was a huge milestone"" for him and his wife. 

Then, over four paragraphs, he proceeded to tell me what a terrible person I am for not making more time for him over the past couple of months or answering his phone calls (he lives in another state and is a few hours ahead, so he almost always calls during the workday- however i'll send him a message and we chat over Facebook messenger regularly). He is now breaking all contact and doesn't want to have anything to do with me or my wife and kids. He has also blocked me on all social media, and has just wiped his hands clean of me. 


AITA here for not contacting him and congratulating him?

Update: thanks for the comments and feedback all. As a quick update- since posting this I've found out that he's also sent the same message to our Mum and has cut contact with her. I received a phone call from her this morning, in tears, and he has cut contact because she didn't call him to congratulate him either. He and his wife have also blocked my Mum on social media and not responding to her messages or answering calls. 

For those who have said there must be info missing- there isn't much else to say. Single parent family growing up, we had a strained and somewhat distant relationship during our teens, and then he moved interstate. We haven't been too close since, but the relationship has been good after he married and had kids and he grew up a little.

My one party trick once I've had a few drinks is to lift people up and twirl them around. My GF loves it when I toss her around but as of late she's started to get annoyed that I'm touching other people. 

I was at the park with a few friends and throwing people around which included seeing if 3 people could stand on my shoulders and back. As we were drinking we quickly came tumbling down in laughter. One girl however seemed to really enjoy me lifting her up to the point she kept asking and asking. I was happy to oblige and always made sure I grabbed her by the waist or bridal style. 

We get drunker and suddenly she wants me to grab her in other places to lift her and wants me to grab her by the neck. I jokingly say ""I'll probably end up choking you"" and she replies she'd like that, I realise it's going too far and stop there. My GF wasn't happy as you can imagine.

On the way home we get into an argument and she says I shouldn't be touching any one else apart from her and I'm causing drama in the group. Apparently some of the guys see me lifting either their GFs or girls they like and feel emasculated, or they try lifting the girls and struggle which makes them embarrassed.

So wealthy that my dad could have easily paid for my college and it wouldn't even have put a small dent in his savings. 

Now growing up, we weren't al that close. I had my differences with him and they only exacerbated after our political opinions started to diverge. I was always respectful, but never let myself get dominated in any argument. It all came to a head in my final year of high school where he flat out refused to pay for college. Said that since I 
agreed I was 'too privileged', I needed to learn about the value of money and to be independent and responsible. 

I asked him whether saddling me with a mountain of debt that would follow me around for years was really worth it, and he said yes. It really was. We argued, but he refused to budge. Ultimately I decided to bite my tongue and keep quiet. I applied for student loans - during the last stages of the loans being approved he even offered to pay half, but this time I refused. An ego driven decision, sure, but I had friends who weren't as rich as my family and felt I could do it if they could and that it was a small price to get away from my smug, controlling father.

I was cordial with dad when I was in college. He helped me out a bit with food and rent - note that I was working part time as well. But when I graduated, got a job and landed on my own two feet, I went full no contact. He's tried to reach out over the years but I have always refused. 

I'm doing well now. But my girlfriend thinks I'm an asshole for completely cutting off contact with him. So, AITA?

In the past, I've been pretty tolerant of her because I assumed she was dealing with a lot of insecurities, but recently she has started to put me down (I have 3 kids) and has become increasingly rude and inappropriate towards my kids. For somebody who touts themselves as a progressive person, she has a very strong ""children should be seen and not heard"" kind of take on kids. 

A week ago we had a BBQ (Covid restrictions have been lifted in our area and we maintained social distancing) that we invited my sister to. I let her know in advance that our neighbors were coming with their kids, so there would be a total of 5 children. She seemed okay with it at the time but the party was really awkward. She managed to insult pretty much everybody there but talking about how narcissistic it is to have kids and how she feels like she must be so much happier than us. She really hurt myself and my husband's feelings and also got weirdly racist by talking about how life for our bi-racial children was going to be ""unnecessarily difficult"" (as if we don't worry about this all day, every day). Aaand capped it off by yelling ""can you please SHUT UP"" at the kids when they were playing loudly. They were playing in the pool in our backyard, of course they're going to be loud. 

After that, I took her inside and told her that she was going to have to either apologize and leave, or just leave. I told her that I'm embarrassed by her and that her attitude just screams that she's insecure. Nobody thinks she's ""cool"" and she doesn't even do anything with all of her vast free time she's always talking about. I told her that if not having children is the most interesting thing about her, maybe she should get a life. 

She left in a huff and called last night, angry crying about how I don't respect her or her life and how I've been the only family member who claimed to understand why she doesn't want kids but now she sees me as ""just as bad as mom and dad"". In her defense, our parents are really traditional and don't understand not wanting kids at all. 

I assured her that I could give a shit if she ever has kids or not, it really makes no difference to me as long as she's happy. But that I cannot tolerate her treating me and my family like shit because of her personal choices. That's where we left it. My husband, who is a saint, thinks I should apologize for some of my comments in an attempt to keep the peace with her, but I don't really feel like she deserves it. 

So AITA?

EDIT: I deleted a lot of the original post due to the word limit, realized I left out a pretty important part. After telling sis she needed to go, she doubled down and told me that there was no reason for the kids to be yelling and she was ""going to parent them if we weren't"". My husband and I are both somewhat strict parents and definitely don't let our kids get buckwild everywhere, but they're kids and playing in the pool is an appropriate time for them to just be loud kids and play. She knew they would be there, if she was really going to be that annoyed then she shouldn't have come. So far, none of the ESH comments have really changed my mind. I was very upset at her because she yelled at my children, and I'm not going to tolerate somebody acting like that towards them.",False,1594522352.0,2020-07-12 02:40:54
317,AITA For showing my teacher a pad?,355,Not the A-hole,67,hp7wml,1594492497.0,"First time ever posting here, so let me know if I can edit anything to make it better. English isn't my native language, so sorry in advance for any spelling/grammar mistake. This will be a bit long. TL;DR at the end.

This dates back to pre-covid times, around February. My Maths teacher has never been nice. He loves to pretend he's ""young"" and makes continuous and often inappropriate jokes, never getting around to actually teaching. He's not good at explaining anything, always reduces his lectures to the last five minutes, and never helps us out with anything. We're expected to be perfect in our class tests and oral expositions nonetheless.

One day, my best friend asks to go to the toilet; she forgets her phone in her back pocket (we are allowed to have phones in class if they are turned off). But she is very good at Maths, so the teacher just tells her to leave it in the class and off she goes.

I was on my period. When my friend comes back, I wear a hoodie and put my pad in a pocket with my hand over it, like I always do. I ask to go to the bathroom; he says yes. As I'm walking towards the door, he tells me to leave my phone in the class. I tell him I have. He motions towards the hands in my pocket and tells me: ""So that's no phone huh."" I'm kind of uncomfortable right now, and I still go: ""That's not a phone"", hoping he catches the hint. He doesn't, and refuses to let me go. At which point i take out my pad, show it to him, making an expression that screams 'does this look like a phone, you idiot?' and walk off to the bathroom, because I really needed to change it. 

When I came back, he was furious. He said it was unnecessary to do so, I had been very disrespectful, so on and so forth. Mind you, the girl he was testing in that moment had been interrupted just so he could scream at me. She got a bad grade because of this by the way. The class head teacher was involved, my mother as well (just because she happened to teach there too), he wrote a note on the register.

Now, all my classmates were on my side, saying I did nothing wrong. He twisted the story both to my mother and the head teacher; my mom was not mad, she hates him too, and the head teacher trusted me more. She did tell me though that I could have handled the situation better, and she could see how he could have gotten offended.

I think I was in the right, and it was kind of time to put him in his place. Still, I feel that maybe I went overboard, and I still feel guilty because of the classmate that got a bad grade because of this. So, Reddit, AITA?

Finally, one of the store employees came over and asked her politely to please pull her mask up. I could sense an argument coming, so I put my headphones in and pretended like I was listening to music but I wasn't.

My mom started lying and saying that she only pulled her mask down for a second to breathe, and the guy said okay but can you please pull it up now? But she kept getting louder and caused a scene.

I was a few feet away with the cart and I was pretending like I didn't know her and finally store security came and asked her to please leave, but she started arguing with them, too.

It was so embarassing - everybody was looking and I just hung my head and pushed the cart into another aisle and pretended like I was looking at the prices of something. My mom started calling my name but I didn't come out, and finally they escorted her out. And then I waited a bit and then I left, too.

She was waiting for me in the car and as soon as I got in, she said, ""I know you heard me calling you in that store. If that's the game you want to play, don't talk to me or ask me for anything ever again."" 

I said sorry, but she ignored me.

When we got home, she told my Dad and he yelled at me and told me never to ignore my mom, and then he made me apologize to her again and then go to my room, where I've just been hanging out all day.

I know you're not supposed to ignore your parents, and I feel really bad about doing that, but this time it was just too embarassing for me.

My husband (27m) and I have always split expenses based on income. When I was making more money than him, I paid a larger percentage of the bills, now that we make about the same we split bills 50/50. We split bills for things that we share (groceries, the house, electricity, etc.) and pay separately for things that only apply to one of us (ex: we each pay for our own gas and car payments since we don‚Äôt drive each other‚Äôs cars and take turns driving when we go places together so it evens out). One expense we‚Äôve normally kept separate is doctor‚Äôs visits. I would pay for my check ups, dentist appointments, etc and he would pay for his. 

As we‚Äôve starting purchasing things for the baby, we‚Äôve been splitting those costs 50/50 since she‚Äôs OUR child. However, when my I told my husband that the prenatal healthcare bill was really expensive and thought we should split that as well, he told me that was ridiculous since it‚Äôs a doctor‚Äôs visit and we normally pay for our own stuff. I said I understood his point but argued that the visits were as much for the baby as they were for me and we‚Äôve been splitting baby costs. I suggested paying a larger portion of the bill since the appointments are for both of us and he told me that made no sense. We‚Äôve already agreed to split her healthcare and any other baby associated costs after she‚Äôs born so I don‚Äôt understand why that doesn‚Äôt apply to her healthcare now. 

Normally this is something I may drop but the bill is really high and I‚Äôm going to struggle to pay it alone. AITA for wanting some help with these bills? What might be a fair compromise if splitting 50/50 is unreasonable?

Edit: Ive seen a lot of people commenting on the way we split expenses so I thought I‚Äôd just address it. We started splitting bills this way when we moved in together but were only dating. It‚Äôs worked for us so far without issue so we‚Äôve just never got around to changing the system or opening a joint account (though now might be the time, my husband has expressed willingness to open a joint account in the past)

My best friend (f/19) has a very good reputation. She's known as a smart, kind but shy girl, nobody dislikes her, she won't talk badly about her friends, she brings them gifts, invites them to her home even though it's small, etc. 

Our friend group slowly started to drift apart in the course of a year. We still hung out sometimes but my best friend and I realised that they slowly started doing stuff without us. It isn't that big of a deal to me, but my friend was upset.

Fast forward a few weeks ago. One of those friends (20), let's call them K, was on a bus without a valid ticket and they got busted. The fee for having no ticket is 70‚Ç¨, but the fee can be reduced to 8‚Ç¨ if you forgot your ticket at home and are able to submit it later. No matter what, you have to fill out a form so they have your information. 

K then chose to submit my best friend's information, planning on asking her to cover them up later because my friend has a valid ticket. K tells my friend, who's annoyed but willing to submit her ticket at a center a few stations from here and cover up that friend. 

A few days later, my friend found out that the information on the form has some mistakes: a non-existent address, spelling mistakes, etc. Even though my friend is sorry, she was at the point where she wanted to come clean and tell the truth at the center, she's already annoyed and cannot risk her ticket getting taken away or her getting sued (which is possible). 

As soon as our old friend group took notice of that, they spam her ‚Äì calls, texts, etc. They asked her to think about K, they have no money, you should be a friend, please don't do this, what kind of friend are you? On our way to the center, she was crying. She wouldn't change her opinion, but she felt like everyone hates her. 

At the center, she told the truth ‚Äì and the lady working there actually let it slide as just 8‚Ç¨ for K and no one getting sued (K was in a position to get sued too, they've done this before already). My friend was relieved, and while the others were happy, they were mad at her for actually telling the truth. They said she risked her friend getting sued and potentially ruining their life + that she's not a true friend. 

K never apologized or said thank you. They didn't even give the 8‚Ç¨ back, another friend did that for them.

Today, those friends ignore her and me. Whenever my friend's texting, they do not respond. They are treating my friend like a traitor, they see me as one too ‚Äì I've been her best friend for years and I supported her, to me it was incredibly brave and smart for her to do that.

Photoshoot ends, and a light bulb is broken because of improper setup. No worries, they offered to replace it, good to go. Non-issue.

Just basic stuff like I shouldn't tell my sister's until I know what it is and maybe I pulled a muscle swimming, since last time I needed a breast exam it was just a pulled muscle. Then we just talked about how stuff is going in general. 

After I got off the phone my roommate who I guess overheard it came down stairs to tell me he thought it was gross that I was talking to my dad about that and he didn't need to know unless I actually had breast cancer and that he doesn't keep his mom updated if he has a problem with his dick. 

I told him it's none of his business and my mom would tell him anyways because she needs someone to talk to when she worried about me. I was tempted to point out that he doesn't keep his mom updated on any of his health because he never goes to the doctor so he wouldn't know if there's a problem, but I didn't say it.

My fiance and I were supposed to get married in the spring but due to the pandemic we had to postpone. Our venue allowed us to move our date to September fora small fee, and we (very naively, in retrospect) agreed to do it because we thought that things would be back to normal by now. Obviously, they aren't. My fiance and I kept going back and forth on what to do, and after a lot of tears and debate, we decided to cancel the wedding completely and elope.

We should be able to get some partial deposits back (the photographer and DJ are willing to work with us, at least), but our venue is being extremely stubborn and says they won't refund us because our state is allowing weddings at this time. We have a consultation with an attorney next week and are going to see what our options are, but I'm not confident we're going to be able to get anything back.

My parents had been expecting us to move forward with the rescheduled September wedding, and now that we've canceled, they're super pissed off and are demanding we reimburse them for the money they gave us. We told them we can give them back the final payments we hadn't made yet and the refunds we will get (about $8,000), but the rest of the money is tied up with the venue and we're unlikely to see it again. We said they need to take this up with the venue, not with us. They won't accept this and insist it's our responsibility to pay them back, even if it has to be through a repayment plan over the next few years.

Fiance and I are frustrated because we're trying to do the right thing for our guests' safety, and we don't feel we should be financially penalized for it. We feel terrible that my parents are losing so much money, but it isn't our fault that our venue is being so unreasonable, and they were the ones who insisted on paying in the first place.

I got mad about the extra violations and texted my girlfriend's daughter to tell him to take care of it. He did the next day and was able to avoid the late fine. He then texted me directly to ask why I didn't pay it, which almost resulted in a late fine. I told him about the extra violations and that he wasn't honest about the number of times he ran the toll. He accused me of one of the violations, but it was clear he had the car then and I called him ""genius"", chidedly. He asked if I had a ""problem"" with him (as if prompting for a fight) and I said ""the only problem I had was his spelling"" (which was poor).

A bit of backstory: i moved three hours away from our tiny hometown and she stayed there. I would always make time to hang out with her, at her or her parents‚Äô house, when i was home, which was frequent in my 20‚Äôs. As i got older and more settled with a career and relationship, i started going home less often. The last time I was home it was only for a few hours and I told Katie if she wanted to see me, she would have to come to my parents house. She said she would, then an hour later made an excuse and never showed. 

When I was planning my wedding, of course I wanted to invite her. She RSVP‚Äôed yes for her, her longtime boyfriend, and her daughter. They never showed up. I could already feel the friendship had run its course before the wedding, and this just kinda proved it. We have not spoken since.

I (45f) recently saw my niece (24f) for the first time in almost a year at a small, outdoor family get together for the 4th of July. We‚Äôre all very proud of her as she finished her bachelor‚Äôs, works full time at a job she loves, lives alone and supports herself independently and is putting herself through graduate school. I don‚Äôt drink but most of our family, including my niece, had been drinking throughout the day. 

I overheard her talking about drug use with my sister (her aunt) and joined the conversation. I‚Äôm not sure how they got on the subject, but apparently my niece had a problem with painkillers when she was in high school, bad enough to the point that she almost overdosed and asked to get treatment. I was irritated that her mom never mentioned this. She assured us that it was circumstantial, she was coping poorly with a lot in her life at the time and she hasn‚Äôt touched drugs since she started mental health treatment and went to an ‚Äúoutpatient treatment program‚Äù (that‚Äôs her nice word for rehab) in high school. 

I found this odd and alarming as she was clearly drunk and if she was truly addicted and had a problem, she shouldn‚Äôt be drinking. Her mom wasn‚Äôt at the gathering so I called her after we left. I was very shocked as my niece has always had a good reputation and seemed to be doing well before all this. I was hurt that she felt the need to hide it for this long and concerned about her drinking. I told her mom about the conversation and suggested she may still have a problem. My niece thinks I‚Äôm an AH for ‚Äútelling on her to her mom‚Äù when she‚Äôs an adult instead of bringing my concerns to her directly. However, I know addiction pretty well and I know if I confronted her she‚Äôd deny she has a problem.

It‚Äôs always because whenever I tell her something, she tells everyone she know and it‚Äôs gotten quite embarrassing. Now onto the actual story.

I had came out to my mom as being bi, and she took it well enough. At least she didn‚Äôt freak out and act like a homophobe. I asked her not to tell anyone because most of our family and her friends are very conservative and would not take this lightly, and she says ok. Fast forward a couple of weeks and we‚Äôre at a family gathering and while we‚Äôre seated at the table I hear my mother just casually say that I‚Äôm bi and almost everyone gasps and starts attacking me for my sexuality. I was mortified and booked it to the car, got in and locked all the doors, after five minutes, my mom came down and drove me home.

As soon as we got home, I ripped into her saying some not so nice things, because now, no one from my family will even talk to me, not even my sweet grandma whom I loved the most. I then went up to my room and locked the door and then just sat on my bed. I have refused to talk to her for the past couple of days because she effectively destroyed my entire relationship with my family.

I don't wear the hijab for religion, I'm not Muslim.  My fiance thinks I'm Muslim because I work with Muslim people in the court.  I wear the hijab to hide a very bad tattoo on my scalp. I went through a stupid phase in my life and was with bad people. I'm not like that anymore, I don't have hate for anyone, now I'm helping the people that my family hurt in the past.  When I wear the hijab, it makes the Muslim people at work comfortable with me, and I think that they forgive me, that I'm like them.

He's let my nephew go to the park and play on the playground, have playdates with other kids, he even had a birthday party for him last month.

I said no cause I know my nephew and brother and his wife have been running around all over the place. He asked why cause it was never a problem before and we hadn't seen my nephew in a long time. I know kids are germ sponges and have bad hygiene in general, and my nephew's been playing with other little kids too. I told my brother as much and he said I was being jerk and was overreacting. They haven't had any symptoms and they were careful, so he says. I told him I didn't think that was true, and he should just hire a sitter.

My brother said that'd be waste of money when we usually babysat for free and my nephew likes seeing his uncle and aunt more than any of his other sitters.

I stopped responding to him (this was over text) but he sent a few more messages asking me to reconsider. I don't wanna have a germy kid around my pregnant girlfriend, idc if he thinks that's ""irrational"". Haven't mentioned this to the gf yet.

She was on the pill and we used condoms every time. She was clear that if she got pregnant, she would consider an abortion but likely not go through with it, and I was very clear that I didn't want a child.

Anyways, she's pregnant and keeping it. However, now she's giving me some fucked up ultimatums, saying that she's not okay with a 'deadbeat vacation dad' who pays child support and takes our son off every once in a while for some quality bonding time, but isn't a full-on parent. I asked her what she expects because I'm not exactly planning to marry this woman and raise a kid with her when we're not even in a relationship.

She says that once he's finished breastfeeding, she expects shared custody and to have two involved parents, otherwise she wants me to give up my rights and she's going to take *our* son and raise him on her own. She's a doctor and makes double what I do so she doesn't care about child support. She says she doesn't want him to grow up feeling like he wasn't good enough for his dad to stick around and would rather he has one good parent to focus on instead of 1.5.

It's ridiculous and manipulative. You can't force somebody to be an involved parent! I've already said I'm more than willing to give child support (I know I have to but keep in mind I don't want a child and don't have a say in the matter, and I've offered more than the minimum I would have to pay. *I'm willing to take responsibility*). There are plenty of men who do their part in child support payments and when they're older and more settled they develop a relationship with their child. I need to keep that option open for myself so I don't have any regrets later. He's my son too at the end of the day. I'm willing to go and at least see him once a month or so right now even when I don't want a child at all. If I give him up then I can't even get *weekend custody* or anything like that later down the line.

So my options are either be a full parent or literally *never see my son again*. I think this is bullshit and have refused, but our mutual friend says I'm an asshole for standing my ground on this.

I‚Äôm looking for a new job and after months of applying and looking around, I landed an interview with a marketing agency near my hometown. The job was for brand marketing, so I do an interview and they seem very pleased with me. The interviewer (‚ÄòJessica‚Äô) explains that the represent many different big-name brands and while the company ‚Äúdid do sales‚Äù, she repeatedly stressed that I was being hired to do coordination with the clients and not sales. Starting pay is $33k and when I‚Äôm offered the job, I accept.

I go in on the following week to sign the paperwork and I‚Äôm greeted with the following red flags:

1. The fact that I was being hired and signing with like 5-6 people at the same time.

2. When I‚Äôm going over the papers, there‚Äôs no $33k. It‚Äôs all ‚Äòcommission‚Äô and ‚Äòpotential to earn‚Äô

4. They want me to work 6 days a week, driving around to various Costco‚Äôs and Menards to sell phones and shit. I would not be compensated for gas. 

I flag down Jessica and ask her what‚Äôs up, this isn‚Äôt the position I interviewed for. She takes me into the hallway and immediately cops an attitude, saying that she made it clear what the position entailed and this is exactly what I‚Äôm signing up for.

I emailed Jessica saying the company didn‚Äôt make it clear about the position and I‚Äôm not taking it.

The same day my grandmother passed my sister gets kicked out of her methadone clinic and black balled at all the surrounding clinics. She claims she didn't do anything wrong and another patient instigated a fight with her. Either way she is now forced to detox from her methadone.  My family and I feel bad for her.

Also despite the withdrawal she wants to attend our grandmothers funeral. Since I am the only immediate family that lives near her it is my job to drive her to and from the funeral.  

The hours spent in the car with her are the longest hours of my life. She non stop monologues about how the clinic was out to get her.  I don't think I talked the whole car ride except to offer her sympathy.  At the funeral my sister immediately goes up to my grandma's casket and takes pictures of her lying there. I think this is when I truly broke. The rest of the funeral was more of the same. The drive back to my sisters place was another hate filled monologue. After that I wanted to just be done with her.

This may be where I become TA because at this point I got nasty with her back and said along the lines of t I had that rule to prevent her bringing a different guy every year into the photo (Paige has always been... Well... Promiscuous so to speak). This caused her to storm off and is now refusing to take the photo at all with her son.

This really grinds me gears because I let her and her son (my grandchild) live in my house rent free and she can't even do this one fucking thing for me without ruining it. 

I just want to add that my other kids  didn't include their partners into the photo until marriage so it's not just for her.

I‚Äôm currently 23 and 5 months pregnant. I lived with my dad as ‚Äúroommates‚Äù a couple years ago and everything was great, we worked different shifts and typically stayed out of each others way and respected privacy. Then he met a girl who is only a few years older than me and basically moved her in after a couple dates. 
It was very awkward at first but I tried to ignore it as I wasn‚Äôt home very often, but then I started to notice my things being used and stuff in my bedroom being moved around. I mentioned it to my dad that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with her using my things as I paid for everything I had and I was working 2 jobs to do so. He claimed she would never touch my things and that he bought everything she needed to live there (she wasn‚Äôt working) and then a few weeks later I had something come up missing, and she swore up and down she didn‚Äôt have it. Later that day she and my dad left so I looked in her bag for my missing item and wouldn‚Äôt you know, she had it. I texted my dad and flipped out, told him if I was his roommate then as his roommate I didn‚Äôt like her living there and that I would be moving out soon.
Things weren‚Äôt great for a few days after that and eventually me and my dad got into a huge screaming match and he strait up kicked me out. I was moved out within a couple weeks and didn‚Äôt speak to my dad for over a year after the incident. Within the time we weren‚Äôt speaking he got married and I only found out through Facebook as my grandma posted about it. 
Around Christmas last year we started to rekindle our relationship but it‚Äôs been slow going and we‚Äôre still not super close, and I still refuse to speak to his new wife. Now that I‚Äôm pregnant he‚Äôs very excited, and has let me know that his wife has already bought the baby a gift. Nice gesture but I‚Äôm still not interested in forgiving her. I‚Äôve already decided she‚Äôs not going to meet my baby but I havnt told my dad this yet, I figured I‚Äôd wait until I‚Äôm closer to having him.

I raised my two kids, Mike and June by myself almost their entire lives. Mike is 31 and June is 29.  Mike has three children whereas June isn't interested in having children. 

I was lucky to always work in the family business so we didn't struggle as much as other single parent households do. My dad passed when my kids were in their early 20s and left behind a considerable amount of money to me. 

My daughter-in-law and I are very close so I see a lot of Mike's children. They're angels and I love to play the doting grandma role. My daughter-in-law's mother passed away so it means a lot to her that the kids are close to the one grandma they have. Mike & his wife aren't in a terrible financial position, they're just two 30-somethings raising 3 kids so there isn't a lot of money to throw around. 

It makes my heart happy to give Mike & his wife money that is intended towards the children. Nothing incredibly extravagant, just small things like paying for skating class, gymnastics class, season passes to the amusement park (unfortunately not this year), new bikes. I always talk to Mike & my daughter-in-law first and if they're okay with it, I love to spoil the grandchildren.

This was never a secret to June but also wasn't something I wanted to outright mention, I didn't want to seem like I was shaming Mike and his family. But when June found out she was VERY unhappy with it. She said it's unfair that I give more money to Mike & his family than I do to her. She said she doesn't necessarily want money or gifts but she wants things to be 50/50 with her and her brother. 

The argument that has really driven a wedge between my kids is that I favor Mike by giving him more money. I've pointed out that it's not like I'm gifting Mike a brand new TV for himself or anything like that. On birthdays/Xmas, Mike & June get similarly valued gifts.

Before I met him, I was in a serious relationship that was extremely abusive - and I haven't seen my ex bf for a few years - but while I was out eating with my daughter and my MIL a old mutual friend of my ex and I's saw me and as she was saying hi, she took one look at my daughter and asked if that was my ex and I's kid. I let her know that we never had any kids, and that she's 2. After I told her that she laughed and said ""Damn, she looks like him for some reason,"" which IMO was extremely rude...esp. because she knew that we had been broken up for a long time and my daughter was still really young. When she left my MIL was making jokes about it saying ""I never knew you guys had a secret baby,"" and then she started to ask me when was the last time I saw him. I answered with ""I don't really even remember but it has got to be at least 3 years ago. "" I explained to her that I saw him in passing once, and it was an awkward moment because it was in Walmart and she kind of laughed it off. FF to Wednesday and me and my bf are having lunch and he asks me if I would ever take a DNA test for him...I answered ""No, I wouldn't see the point -"" but that if he wanted me to I certainly would, and I would also feel offended - the same way he would if I asked to check his phone records going back 5 years. He told me I was being irrational, and when I asked why he even randomly asked me that he said that his mom had ordered a DNA test and wanted him to have me conduct it on the baby because people have been telling her she doesn't look anything like her. A little background.. my daughter looks like both of us, I am black and he is white with hazel eyes - she is caramel, brown eyes and has curly hair that has blonde highlights while my MIL is blonde haired and blue eyed. He and his mother look nothing alike and him asking for a DNA test would insinuate that I cheated on him 2 years ago, which also offends me. For now, I am refusing the DNA test almost as a way to protest him offending me in such a way but then I also feel like it makes me look guilty. I told my best friend about it and she said I should just take the test and then take a break from the relationship because that means he didn't trust me. I tried to explain to him how it almost feels like my ex is still abusing me by having me be questioned, and having our kid be questioned and it seemed like it registered to him. We curbed the discussion after I explained that to him but now his mom is texting me about it saying she spent so much money on the test and she needs to know for her own sanity, which is making me upset again. Am I the asshole here for refusing the DNA test?

UPDATE: My bf and his mother got into it pretty bad last night. He told her she was a bitch for always trying to make his gfs feel like shit so they will leave him and that her shady past has blurred her vision on how relationships work. She told him I was probably sleeping around to get over my ex...even though it was at least 5-6 years since we had already broken up, and that she DEMANDED a test before she kept treating her like a grandbaby.

He is our baby and we love him dearly. He was given to us as a gift for my brother (7) with Autism to help with the transition of me being out of state for school. (Baby brother and I are close, I‚Äôm essentially his second mom). Golden doodles sell for quite a bit of money, but he was completely free. My parents had to get him shots and neutered, and that‚Äôs about it. 

My mom recently started looking for another pup. I will be going back to school in January, my 18yo brother starts college in August, and the 7 and 6yo start school in August as well. Both of my parents work. She doesn‚Äôt want our current dog to be lonely while we are gone which is why she‚Äôs looking for another pup.

I‚Äôm super on board with this idea. I love pets, and our current doodle is the first pet we‚Äôve ever had as a family (because of housing situations). I would love to have another one. 

The thing is, my mom and I agreed to go halves on the pup when the idea first came up. The first one we looked at was a schnauzer for about $250, which was fine except for the fact that we didn‚Äôt get him. We‚Äôve gotten close other times, but missed out as well. We‚Äôve been doing extensive research on where to adopt as well as looking on locally based sites like craigslist and Facebook groups. We almost paid $400 for a small poodle, but decided not to because of his location. Again, we were going to go halves, which was fine. 

However, somehow all the responsibility has shifted to me, my mom has been saying that I‚Äôm paying for the dog on my own. Now she‚Äôs been looking at pups in the $500+ range. I don‚Äôt mind helping buy a puppy, but that‚Äôs a lot of money to be all on me. I work, but I‚Äôm also saving up for when I go back to my university. Especially if at the end of the day HER name is on the adoption paper. Considering I‚Äôm paying for the pup, I think I should legally be the owner. I would also like to be able to take it with me when I eventually move out.

349,AITA for not wanting my brother's graduation party to be thrown on my birthday?,270,Not the A-hole,82,hq5rj2,1594630573.0,"I'm currently living with my family due to the pandemic. I would never be able to live with myself if one of them got sick and I wasn't there to help (especially since my father is having surgery soon, no relation). However, things are getting somewhat better in my home state (knock on wood) so we're all trying to get back to normal. Well, not normal, but you know what I mean.

My brother graduated from high school this year, but of course, he wasn't able to have his graduation ceremony. To my surprise, he didn't care in the slightest. I guess he just wants to move on as quickly as possible (and since it's high school, I can't blame him). When the ceremony was rescheduled (the date still hasn't come yet) he didn't even want to go, but my parents made him. He also wasn't able to have his graduation party, but that has recently changed and we plan on having it before he starts attending college.

Here's where the conflict comes in. For some reason my mother wanted to throw it on my birthday (I'll be 23 in case you're wondering, though I'd rather keep the date private). I wasn't very happy about that as that's MY day. It's not like a graduation ceremony where there's nothing you can do about what day it is; the schedule is entirely up to her. She hadn't even sent any invites yet.

My mom is the kind of person who HATES having her ideas/plans questioned. When I told her how I felt she basically said, ""you're turning 23. What kind of celebration could you have anyway?"" Now it's not like I'm planning to have a big birthday party like I did when I was a kid; I know I'm too old for that kind of thing. However, I would still like to do something like have dinner and cake with my family and a couple friends, especially since we haven't been able to see each other in person for so long. I would just feel a bit forgotten if my brother was the one who got a big celebration instead. I know my family would be too tired after a party like that to do anything like a special dinner. I mean, if it were the other way around, how would my brother feel? I'm afraid of being forgotten (which is an issue I've struggled with for years due to my past and my high anxiety). I tried to explain every bit of this to my mother, but she just keeps repeating the same excuses and I'm super non confrontational. I feel like she thinks I'm acting like a child.

I told my brother about my mother's plan (full disclosure, I didn't accuse him of anything, I just nonchalantly brought it up) and, to my surprise, he was mad too. He told I deserved to have my special day. My dad also thought it was dumb to schedule the party then as, like I said, it's not like we couldn't just have it a different weekend. I did feel better knowing they were on my side.

To make a long story short, my mother agreed to have my brother's party the day before my birthday instead. However, she still keeps acting like I was unreasonable to be upset.

I don't know, fellow Redditors. Was I acting like a child? AITA?

EDIT: Thank you all for the comments, supportive or not. Reading them did help me to understand other viewpoints. For those of you who were concerned about parties taking place during the pandemic, my brother‚Äôs would take place in our backyard and everyone would wear masks. Anything for me (again, I don‚Äôt need to have a big party, just dinner or something, especially since my family will be tired from my brother‚Äôs party and I don‚Äôt want them to worry about more than one person on the same day) would be on a much smaller scale with only 1 or 2 friends outside of my family. I also plan on getting my brother an extra special graduation gift. You guys are right, he‚Äôs awesome and deserves it.

Also, for those of you whose birthdays are hardly considered due to other holidays or circumstances (there were a lot more of those than I thought) don‚Äôt ever forget that you deserve to celebrate your special day too.

It‚Äôs been a week and a half now he has spoken to the kid once on the phone. They live away and we cannot visit(we‚Äôre both essential workers) 

I never brought the ex up, never said anything about them. I wanted him to be fully responsible for his decision- whether or not to stay in the child‚Äôs life. I kinda threw myself into work last week with 24hour shifts, but finally built the courage to face him and act more normal than im fine love you bye. It was a bit immature but I have a very stressful job and this situation‚Äôs making my cry as I type.

I said I didn‚Äôt want to influence his decision regarding the 8yo but he pushed and I said I‚Äôd support him until he makes a choice then I‚Äôll make mine.

My friends are all on my side and think he‚Äôs a dick for adding more stress to me especially because it‚Äôs the reason why we lost a child last year. ( irrelevant but the logical side of me didn‚Äôt let me grieve for long because I work too much to have the luxury to, I didn‚Äôt know I was pregnant, and because I knew I couldn‚Äôt financially support a child) 

I think he picked me.  Like five mins ago the ex left me a bunch of mean messages on my ig, I didn‚Äôt go through them because I don‚Äôt need her negativity + I get under twenty minutes of time on my phone and they all go to chatting with my fianc√© or our families.",False,False,2020-07-10 21:59:16

People here value the family bond more than anything else. You rarely even see people move out of their parents' place before getting married (especially for women, and I am a woman myself so I feel it often). I personally don't agree with that notion but I digress.

I have received a scholarship to go study in Japan and going there has been my dream for the longest time. My parents know this well. I have had the opportunity to go there immediately after finishing high school but my parents opposed it (reasons being that I'm still too young and irresponsible to go that far away alone) so I decided to stay. I got my bachelor's degree and now, once again, I get the opportunity to go finish my studies in Japan.  


When I first announced this to my parents, my mother started crying and my dad got really angry and told me he felt like I was making that decision by myself, without consulting them, especially since they have no idea what I'm going to be doing there. I am 22 and I feel like I'm an adult and should have the option to decide my own future. After having a huge argument about how I need them to agree on anything I want to do, I sat down and decided to make a powerpoint presentation where I explain in detail the kind of studies I'll be having there, how my life is going to be and the whole process of moving.  


I sat them down and gave them a 1 hour talk and answered all their questions. In the end, it seemed like they understood everything and didn't have any more questions so I asked if they'd allow it now. They told me they had to think about it- seemed reasonable so I accepted. The next day, I brought it up again and my mother immediately said ""you may go study there, but don't even think about getting a job and settling down so far away from us.""

Now, I didn't want to hide my intentions from my parents so I told them that my main purpose of going there was to get a degree but if I find a good job, I will be staying. My mothers breaks down in tears and tells me that she has lived her whole life away from her mother and she will not let the same thing happen again. (My mother got married rather young to my dad who lived in a different country, she sees her mother about once in 3 months).

I know that if I fail to go this year, I will have to give up on this dream. This is the thing I've always wanted to do and now I'm so close to getting there and I'm even willing to disobey my parents and they know that, which is why they're now giving me hell.

I really, really don't want to wear shorts. I know it sounds weird, and that's why I've kind of tried to just use makeup to cover them up, but that doesn't work. Personally, I just think she's overreacting. 

I am extremely self conscious about my legs, mainly because I just know they're ugly. the scars are really deep and I know that my mom will yell at me and demand to know why I have them. She isn't understanding with things like that, and she'll immediately assume I'm trying to get attention. 

She just told me today that if I don't wear shorts, her birthday will be ruined. I personally think that's just ridiculous, so I told her that I won't wear them, and if she'll overreact like that then so be it. She started yelling at me, ""Who do you think you are?!"" and ""I gave birth to you and kept a roof over your head and this is how you repay me?"" and stuff like that. I just feel really bad now.

356,WIBTA if I leave my mum unable to pay rent because of a baby,260,Not the A-hole,45,hosg8n,1594428648.0,"
Don‚Äôt judge till you‚Äôve read the whole thing please!
Also I‚Äôm on mobile so you know the deal.

Backstory;
I (22F) don‚Äôt like children and I never have, vowed never to have them etc. My mum (46F) on the other hand, thinks the sun shines out of their rear ends. I‚Äôm currently house sharing with my mum, fianc√© (22M) till he sells his own place for us to move in together, and little brother (4M), who is the only kid I like/love and would do anything for.
I pay half for everything, my mum pays the other half.

So. My mum has recently fostered my cousin‚Äôs (18F) baby (1M) due to my cousin being mentally unstable enough to look after him. 
I have one place I can put my things in the whole house, which half I pay for and that‚Äôs my bedroom which I‚Äôve had to put a lock on so that the children can‚Äôt get in. 
I don‚Äôt do baby goo, dribble, mushy food and mess, it makes me nauseous. 
When they were first deciding whether to give him to my mum, they spoke to me. I expressed how that I do not want this child in my house as my little brother then gets ignored, as he does most days and now only listens to me and then proceeds to get shouted at by my mum for not listening to her, my mum can barely cope with my brother and I dislike children and know i would end up having to help out with the child which I strictly disagreed to in the beginning as I raised my brother for 70% of his life due to my mum working insane hours.
I‚Äôm now at the point where I just want to move out and leave my mum to struggle due to the stress and no sleep because all the baby does is cry 24/7 no matter what you do. And I know he‚Äôs probably confused and stressed out but it‚Äôs ruining my relationship with my fianc√© and my mum‚Äôs relationship with my brother. I even feel like just taking him with me to live somewhere else.
I don‚Äôt believe in leaving family to struggle and beyond all this I do love my mum to the world and back and I‚Äôm getting really stressed out with what‚Äôs best to do for myself, and family.
If anyone could give me advice on what to do or whether I‚Äôd be the asshole to just leave once COVID has calmed down please as this is eating at me.

357,AITA for telling my mother to stop pushing personal boundaries (RE: her wanting to know my exact bank balance abroad).,252,Not the A-hole,118,hpn7lr,1594551360.0,"The TLDR; Mother has no concept of personal boundaries with me, constantly attempts to breach them.


Things she has attempted to implement control over me includes: Banking/finances, my location, my freedom of speech, my relationships, my friendships and so on. Every time I say no, she explodes into a fit of anger, says I've been ungrateful and that my so called honesty only came into play when my partner and I started going out and that he's the one somehow manipulating me. Either that or ""the internet is manipulating you"".


Context;


I am a 27 year old female living with my partner halfway across the planet from where my family live in. I am an English teacher, am fully independent, responsible and frugal with my spending. It's been 2 years since moving out.


Along with my full time job, I had 3 part time jobs. My mother would say I'm lazy and constantly demand that I do all the cleaning/tidying and sometimes the cooking in the house. I was also tasked with taking care of my then 5 year old brother like a parent, and providing emotional support for 15 year old sister. Despite being 25 then, my mother would brute force and breach personal boundaries at every possible opportunity. She'd open my mail without permission, nosey her way into conversations, sneak into our phones & view messages/emails and if she felt we weren't being open enough with her, our door would be removed so she had free access to go in whenever. We weren't allowed to lock the door to the toilet.


...I have many reasons why I don't trust her with giving personal information. She's shared embarrassing info to random extended family members or friends.
Fast forward to now where I'm in a safe and loving relationship, halfway across the planet. Sure things aren't great with corona right now, but my partner and I have been emotionally supporting each other really well, and doing fun activities to pass the time. My mother calls a couple times during the month. The most recent couple of times have been very problematic but last one was related to banking. ""How much money you got in your bank in X country right now?"".


I didn't want to tell her because she'll tell me to get a ticket back to their country so I have no option but to be with them at home. So I say honestly (my partner has helped me become more open and comfortable to expressing how I honestly feel), ""Hi mom, please don't take it personally I don't feel comfortable telling you the exact amount of money. I am in a good place financially, isn't that all you need to know?"". She goes into a rage fit how I am an ungrateful daughter, that she used to pay for yearly trips abroad with the family in the summer, and that my partner is manipulating me because I never said that before. ""WE'RE FAMILY, WE DONT KEEP SECRETS. I AM YOUR MOTHER, HOW DARE THAT YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ME "". She slammed the phone on my face after a barrage of insults was thrown.

Anyway, what I wanted to ask was, was I the asshole in this case?

She refuses all of my help and has isolated my son from me. For example, when I tell her that blueberries are good for the baby when she was eating fast food, my son asked why I kept giving her stuff that made her nauseous. 

Our breaking point was when I noticed her feet were longer and more swollen so I decided to gift her medical grade compression socks. She retaliated by calling me a ‚Äú Karen‚Äù to my son. 

My daughter in law before 19 lived in Bulgaria before coming here for college and grad school. She has since gotten a job in a tech firm. But I noticed that when she was in Bulgaria she dressed up with blackface for Halloween and it was still in an old Facebook album.

360,AITA for not naming my baby boy after my father in law,245,Not the A-hole,66,hpv3bs,1594592315.0,"Hello reddit! Ok we must get a little context before

I come from a very traditional Jewish community, not strictly orthodox, just faithful to our traditions 

Where we come from its a very strict and common tradition to name our children like the parents of the baby's dad (and the next children like the parents of the mothers') , it's almost like it's expected from us. It's not a religious law but a tradition (you know just like fiddler on the roof they were not kidding when they say traditions are really important).

I must say that my family is very modern, and open to changing tradition, my sister didn't name his second born after my dad, for example, because in my family we consider respect to be beyond just a name. But within our circle it's considered disrespectful not to follow this tradition. 

My father in law has only one son and three daughters, so my husband will be the only one to ""carry the family name"" . (I already start feeling like an asshole as I'm writing on), so it doesn't matter if two of his grandchildren are named after him (Freddie) the ""important"" one is supposed to be my son. 

Personally I hate this tradition because you rob your children of their own identity because they are only their grandparents grandchildren and not their own self, they rob you from the joy of choosing your baby name and I swear I know Jewish babies named Adolf because of that tradition, you have no idea how much against it I am.

We named our first daughter Jeanette hannah,  I chose the hannah because I really wanted to give her that name, and it's very close to Jeanette I believe, the arrange was for me to call her hannah and everyone else Jeanette but in the end hannah just sticked on. 

So we named our son Fred Joshua, I chose the middle name, even though in mexico its really not common to use a middle name. I loved the name Joshua because of its meaning and also its not too far away from the roots of why they called my FIL Freddie (it's really a long story if you want to know I'll add it in the comments). I wanted to give him a hebrew name to make him attached to his roots and history, and also Joshua means salvation, and that warms my heart so much since he almost died at childbirth and he was saved

My son is 5 months old and I can't call him anything because when I call him freddie I feel bad because I really hate that name and hate the idea that his name means nothing but my FIL's ego and I really really hate that name, but when I call him Joshua I feel like a real asshole for breaking my FIL's heart. I actually don't dare to call him that in front of him.

My husband calls him freddie and my family calls him Joshua and I'm in the middle of just being the asshole who didn't just call him freddie and got along with it like most people do.

361,AITA for being upset that my parents let my pet die while I was on vacation?,245,Not the A-hole,52,hqjniv,1594690098.0,"EDIT: Apparently it's not very clear so to clarify, my parents were completely aware that the rabbit was sick and they consciously decided not to go to the vet and let her die instead.

I had a pet rabbit (Sally) for 5 years. It was the only pet my parents would let me get. A few months ago Sally got sick (for the first time ever). She was barely moving and just lethargic. We took her to the vet, my mother even cried because she thought Sally would die, the first time I've seen her cry ever. But they fixed her up and said it was a stomach problem probably due to eating something bad (we are not sure what it might have been) and since then she seemed totally fine again. 

  
I was visiting a friend for two weeks up until yesterday. During that time my parents didn't tell me anything was wrong. When I came back they admitted that while I was away Sally died and they already buried her. Apparently she got sick again like last time and they just decided to not go to the vet again. It took me a few hours to realize but now I'm really pissed. It's not about money for sure, we could easily pay for the vet costs. It's like they just couldn't be bothered to drive to the vet, even just to euthanize her. It might even be that they intentionally used this chance to get rid of Sally, they didn't really like her and never interacted with her.

  
 Now that I think about it it might even be suspicious that she just happened to get sick while I was gone. But even if that's totally true it just means they let her die in pain possibly even over a few days idk. And now I don't know how to act about this. I am not surprised my mother would do this because she has no real heart for animals but my father normally does, but he usually does whatever she says. But if I bring this up the only thing that will happen is that my mother yells at me for being ungrateful and that it was technically her rabbit bc she paid for it or whatever.

My husband and I watched Hamilton tonight.  I‚Äôve been listening to the soundtrack since it came out (before I met my husband) and was so excited to get to see it.  I have listened to the soundtrack since before meeting my husband, and he refused to listen to it.  He said he wants to listen to it only if he was seeing the show. Given the price of tickets and lack of broadway access, he was not likely to see the show anytime soon until recently. 

At the intermission of the show (which we were watching in our home) my husband made it known that he didn‚Äôt appreciate me singing along to any of the songs as it took away from his experience.  He said he couldn‚Äôt understand what the words were when I sang along.  I find that hard to believe considering he takes pride in his ‚Äúperfect‚Äù hearing and routinely tries to test my hearing to determine how damaged it is.  Personally, I think he forfeited a unique, unspoiled viewing experience given how long the show has been running, I stopped singing and/or humming along to the second act.  

After the show I expressed how I felt it was unfair that he dictate to me how the show should be watched given he has had more than enough time to listen to the soundtrack.  He claims I continued ruining the second act for him by singing along, although he can‚Äôt tell me what song(s) I was supposedly singing along to (he spent about ten minutes running through songs in the second act and couldn‚Äôt tell me which song I was supposedly singing along to).

I fully believe I did not sing along to any song in the second act.  I fully admit to crying through 2-3 songs during the second act, but that is not the same thing as singing along.

When Son was 6 months old MIL came over to visit and I went to work, leaving MIL, Ex, and Son alone in our flat. When I got home MIL and Son were gone. Ex said MIL had taken him for a walk a few hours ago and was probably taking her time. I called MIL, who said she was heading to her house with my son (4 hours away) and she'd look after him for a couple of weeks so she could see him (she'd only seen him twice before this) and to give me and Ex ""alone time"". I drove and got him that same night with MIL screaming at me. FIL was reasonable and helped me. Ex convinced me she was trying to help so he continued to invite her over and got annoyed when I refused to leave them alone.

When Daughter was just over a year old MIL went out with Ex, Son, and Daughter and Daughter came back with pierced ears. Ex knew I didn't want her ears pierced but said MIL had talked him into it and ""once she paid there was no use arguing"".

MIL has also undermined me on various parenting aspects, starting with the names of my children, which I agreed on with Ex but MIL changed his mind, so I ended up compromising with her. This continued in the form of unsolicited feedback on my parenting, not even advice, just straight up ""you've done this completely wrong"" despite me doing it for years. She also actively discouraged Ex from proposing because she feels he can do better and called me paranoid for not leaving her alone with my kids.

So now Ex and I are splitting up. MIL and FIL don't see much of the kids, maybe every few months, if that, and they've never been with the kids unsupervised since the incident with Son. They have no case for grandparent rights and couldn't get them if they tried. Ex and I have right of first refusal in the custody agreement, which basically means if he needs a babysitter he needs to ask me to babysit first, and vice versa.

I asked if anything could be done about MIL in terms of keeping her away, because Ex has proved he cannot say no to his mother and I've basically been the only defense against her for years. What really did it for me was seeing MIL recently where she basically said that now Ex and I have split up she'll be able to see the kids more. My lawyer said with the 2 incidents I mentioned we could attempt to get a restraining order, but said I should talk to Ex first and see if we could come to an agreement. During the conversation Ex basically said he had no intention of keeping MIL away from the kids. When we mentioned the possibility of an RO, Ex flipped and accused me of accusing him of being an unfit parent, and that as MIL's not my mother I have no say and it's up to him and him alone how often she sees his kids.

I talked it over with my brother, who had a messy divorce/custody battle a while back and recommended my counsel to me, and he basically said that saying MIL could never see the kids (which is what an RO would do) is too far and I need to calm down and trust Ex's judgement.

I (16M) live with my parents in their penthouse. For the past month or so of the lockdow, my parents have started coming into my room and spending hours at a time here. I have always been a very private person, and I absolutely need my space, so this has irritated me.

Now, the house has 3 rooms excluding mine, and including the living room, my parents have 4 options as to where they can spend their time, but they choose to use my room as a lounge. My room is already the smallest in the house, and when a total of 3 people decide to stay here for hours, it feels even smaller.

Before you say that they just want to spend time with me, they don‚Äôt. They barely talk to me. Even before they started doing this, we spent at least a couple of hours together. So any chances of them doing this to spend ‚Äúquality time‚Äù with their son are lost.

I have been ignoring this for over a month. Even though this has annoyed me out of my mind, I have stayed silent. I stayed silent throughout the times they entered my room during my classes, I stayed silent whenever they came in and I was trying to focus on something, and I stayed silent whenever they came in while I was trying to masturbate. 

Now, this morning, they came in again. I was anxious for a number of reasons, and them coming into my room was not helping. I told them I was busy, and they didn‚Äôt listen.

He and his fiancee are both child free. Due to him not liking kids he has his boundaries, including babysitting being out of the question. He has never been alone with my son. I am fine with that because I love my brother but he's not the most patient person, and he doesn't really like it when my son, age 6, acts his age.

So now my brother's getting married. He wants my son to be ring bearer. His fiancee has a niece who she wants to be the flower girl, and both kids are going to do a reading together at the ceremony. My brother has admitted this isn't their idea, it's coming from her parents who are paying for half the wedding so they're going with it on that basis. There's no other young kids, and they want everyone going down the aisle in pairs, so my son and the niece are in a both or neither situation.

My brother asked a few days ago if my son could be ring bearer. I asked what that entailed, and my brother said it's basically just suit shopping and a few rehearsals. I told my brother to let me know when he needed me to bring my son to the suit shop, and he said I couldn't come because this was ""a guy thing"" and it would be weird if I was there (partly due to the ""guy thing"" and partly because one of the groomsmen is my ex). I said I got why he didn't want me there so maybe it would be a good idea for me to take my son shopping separately. He said he wanted to get them all done at once. I then straight up said that I didn't want his first time babysitting to be in public where my son could wander off while my brother was distracted. He said I was overreacting and the rest of the groomsmen would be there, but of his 4 groomsmen I only know one of them (the ex) and I don't think he'd want to watch my son. My brother then said that could be a test run for the rehearsals, as he also expected me to leave my son with him then. I then said that I didn't want my brother's second time supervising my son to involve fire while my brother focused on other stuff (he's meant to carry a candle). I asked if he'd be willing to babysit my son alone between now and the suit shopping just so I know he is capable of watching my son, and he accused me of trying to con him into babysitting for free and treating him like an idiot. I said my issue was the public setting plus my brother not watching him before this and my brother said ""just get him a phone, he'll be fine"".

You can still have your college savings and we really want you to go to college, but it's going to be very difficult as a freshman with a newborn.""

Kim always said ""I'm an adult and it doesn't matter what you think"". That deeply hurt me, I have a very close relationship with my parents and siblings. Life is all about family and human connection, not this ""me against the world"" mentality. She feels we upset we didn't celebrate her pregnancy, she thinks we're unfair towards her boyfriend who is childish, rude, and lacking ambition.

They both still have their jobs thankfully, but now Kim is coming to me saying that she needs our help because she doesn't know how she can go back to school. Their jobs are low paying, rent isn't cheap, minimal savings, childcare costs are killing them, and she hates her job. 

&#x200B;

Now she wants our help and says she'll take whatever we can give, whether it's them moving in with us or us giving them money for living expenses/school. After years of shutting us out of everything, she's hit a dead end and the money has run out and she wants help. My husband is against it (although open to discussion) but I'm not sure how I feel about it. I love my daughter and granddaughter so much, I want them to be in a better position. I know Kimmy feels a lot of guilt that her baby doesn't have the same quality of life that she did as a child and that hurts me too. If my other daughter asked for help, I would do so in a heartbeat. Because she's always kept us close and cares for us. But with Kim? I don't know. It's not even about the money, it's about all the pain she's caused.",False,False,2020-07-10 00:31:50

We tend to get ignored at family meetups because the in-laws just talk about their kids to each other.

We don‚Äôt really bother seeing fianc√©‚Äôs family anymore because we feel invisible. We do still make an effort for B*days & Xmas by buying them gifts  NP1 is 5 he is extremely spoiled & his snob of a father insists on dressing him only in Ralph Lauren & other designer clothing & so has sometimes refused gifts if they cost less than a certain amount because only the finest is good enough for his son. NP1 is now following suit & is extremely entitled for his age & throws huge tantrums to get what he wants. NP2 is a newborn & will no doubt be the same soon enough. SIL2 is in desperate competition with SIL1 & immediately got pregnant soon after her pregnancy announcements so their kids are similar in age & of course this means NPs2 & 3 HAVE to get copies of whatever NP1 has. NPs2 & 3 are feral & have never been told no in their lives & so are immune to discipline. BIL has 2 daughters 1 is 4 & the other is a toddler.

Both have graduated from college, but are currently living with me due to the situation and such. Neither have jobs since they both got laid off at the beginning of all of this. I'm happy to have them both back at the house, it was getting lonely since my husband passed not to long ago. I had saved up roughly 50k for each for college. My one kid, who we'll call J, and my other kid, who we'll call S, are twins. J got a scholarship that covered most of her school expenses, but I paid for rent, food, etc. I was super proud of her. S also went to college, though she didn't get a scholarship, which I was fine with. I was also super proud of her. I didn't want either of them to start out life with a bunch of student loans, so I was happy to pay for both of them since I could afford to do so. S also worked part-time to help pay.

Now that they are both out of jobs and living with me, J has started asking about the rest of her ""rightly deserved money"". She wants it, I don't know if its to save or spend, but she claims that its not her fault she got a scholarship and that I didn't have to pay as much for her as her sister. I was planning on either doing renovations, possibly moving (my house is kinda big now that its just me), or going on a vacation in a few months (depending how things go) with the money. Obviously, after they both move out and get new jobs. I told her this and she got super mad. She kept going on and on about how it was her money. S stepped in and said that she should be grateful for all the help I've given both of them. Now J is mad at me and S and J are fighting. Was I wrong for not giving her the money?

I'll also add that I've not asked either to pay rent, food, etc while they have been living with me. So, whatever money they had at the begging before their job loss, they should still have most of.

She married rich, and died rich. She gave me money outright, no stipulations or anything. My brother however got half of what I got, and his was put in a trust.

Hubby decided to go on a rant about how this isn‚Äôt the Hilton and we don‚Äôt need to make 4 different meals for everyone.

They adopted my younger sister (now 12) when I was in college. Dad and his wife are pretty religious, and so is lil sis (who I will call Bonnie). 

&#x200B;

I split from my ex-husband early last year. Shortly after, I met a wonderful woman and began seeing her. At the time, I wasn't looking for anything serious, but we just connected so well - and we're still together now, about 14 months later. I've always identified as bisexual, but never came out before then as I had not been in a meaningful relationship with a woman. When I finally did come out to my dad, he replied, ""Well, I've always felt like everyone is a little bit bisexual. Why are we so stuck in binaries?"" 

&#x200B;

While visiting family for the holidays six months later (girlfriend did not attend, as I was traveling to another state and it interfered with her family plans), Dad asked me not to mention girlfriend to Bonnie. I asked why, thinking it was weird, and he said ""Oh, well you know, she was used to \[ex-husband\], and is still figuring out that you've split and what that means."" I thought that was weird... I felt a bit bothered... but I didn't push it.

Bonnie recently got her first cell phone - something that happened earlier than originally planned because of the pandemic and her loneliness.  She and I have been texting A LOT. She is currently learning to sew, and my girlfriend is a seamstress... so, naturally, I thought it would be cool to connect the two of them so GF could answer her questions and offer her advice. I called my Dad, asking if I could finally tell Bonnie about GF. 

&#x200B;

Dad said no. He once again pointed out that ex-husband and I had not been split long, to which I said, ""It's been over a year... I don't understand."" He assured me, multiple times (even though I didn't bring it up), that his stance had nothing to do with my partner being a woman. That he would ""feel the same way if her name was Bob."" I pointed out that he married my stepmom less than a year after separating from my mom, when I was about the same age, so it seemed a bit off. He then became upset, saying, ""Just because I didn't handle things well doesn't mean that you can repeat my mistakes. This is a slap in the face."" 

&#x200B;

I am brokenhearted and feel betrayed. I also hate feeling like I have to hide my partner from my sister when I love both of them dearly and know that they would get along well. Bonnie watches tons of anime and cartoons with queer representation, so I know that she knows that other sexualities exist. He's also told me that they have talked about it before, as ""you can't go a day in today's culture and not see other sexualities."" Further, I remember being in the car with them once while I was still with my ex, and Bonnie talking about how ""love is love"" and ""boy or girl, it doesn't matter.""

To start with, my great-grandpa isn‚Äôt like, Robert De Niro or anything, but he‚Äôs very well known in a specific sporting community. It‚Äôs a really popular sport in my country and he used to be the manager/coach of our national team, which performed very well when he managed them. 

So, my (19F) great-grandfather has just turned 81, so I made a post about him on my instagram with some pictures of us and a couple of memories of him from when I was a kid. He‚Äôs always been really important to me, but 3-ish years ago he was diagnosed with dementia. To give you an idea of the ‚Äústage‚Äù he‚Äôs at, he still lives at home with my Nana and he has a specialist (? Not sure of the word) come over once a week to check up on him. 

Well, my friend, Jack, messaged our group chat to express his surprise at who my grandpa is. He‚Äôs a huge fan of the sport, and plays it for our university. He asked me some questions about my grandpa that I was more than happy to answer for him, and I shared some memories of the trips he took me and my friends on when I was a kid. Grandpa always loved to meet my friends when I was younger and he‚Äôd always hand out autographs and old merchandise and things. 

Jack asked me, admittedly very politely, if he could meet Grandpa too. I had to say no. Grandpa struggles with his memory, especially with remembering people. He‚Äôs even starting to forget some of my cousins who he doesn‚Äôt see as regularly. It really stresses him out when he thinks he can‚Äôt remember to someone and to meet new people generally. I explained this all to him and apologised for the circumstances.

Well, Jack called me unfair, and this all happened in the group chat and our other friends agreed with him. They said it‚Äôs unfair that I‚Äôm ‚Äúgatekeeping‚Äù Jack‚Äôs idol from him because I let my old friends meet him. They also said I‚Äôm an AH for not telling Jack before who my Grandpa was. Then my friend, Emma, suggested I give Jack some of the old merchandise as a compromise, but I said no to that too. And Grandpa can‚Äôt really write very well anymore so an autograph isn‚Äôt really possible. 

From how I see it, I don‚Äôt wanna put my grandpa at a discomfort by making him meet someone new and he‚Äôs given so much of his old merchandising away over the years that there‚Äôs not all that much left. There‚Äôs still a very considerable amount, but there literally used to be storage lockers full of it. 

From how they see it, I have a connection to Jack‚Äôs literal idol and I very easily could take Jack to meet him. Grandpa /would/ forget his discomfort pretty quickly after Jack leaves. It would be a once in a lifetime opportunity for Jack. I get how incredible it would be for him.

In high school they went back on their deal of letting me go on it if i went to therapy for 6 months. It‚Äôs been 7 years since I came out, and as an adult I can make my own medical decisions. 

I‚Äôve been avoiding it because I still live with them, and they support me with school, housing, food, ect. I don‚Äôt hate my parents. I love them a lot. I understand that i‚Äôm getting an incredible amount of support especially for someone my age. But I still want to start taking testosterone to continue my transition, even though i know it will upset them. 

Would I be the asshole for going against my parents wishes to finally start my transition medically? 

I‚Äôm on mobile so please excuse any formatting issues.

EDIT 1: For the people asking how I would pay for it, in california it‚Äôs covered by state health care, and it‚Äôs covered by the plan i‚Äôm currently under as well.

387,AITA for euthanizing my roommate‚Äôs cat without permission?,280,No A-holes here,119,hrpwm1,1594856600.0,"Title sounds awful, I know, but I promise it‚Äôs a bit more complicated than that.

My roommate (Charlie) and I (both 22) have two cats. Mine is a younger cat who I adopted a few years ago when we first got a place together. Charlie brought his childhood cat (Ralph) when he moved in. If i had to guess, I think Ralph would be around 16 or 17. 

Charlie had to rush home out of state for a family emergency, leaving me in charge of both cats for the week. Ralph was frail in his old years and required a lot of special care, but I‚Äôve cared for elderly cats in the past. He seemed more lethargic than usual for the first couple of days, but I assumed he just missed his dad and continued to care for him as normal. 

The fourth morning, Ralph had a seizure. I had no idea what to do. I tried calling Charlie again and again but no answer. Thankfully Ralph stopped seizing, but he was clearly sick and out of it. I wasn‚Äôt getting any response from Charlie, so I decided to call our vet instead. While I was on the phone Ralph had another short seizure. They told me to bring him in right away, so I packed him up in my car and floored it to the clinic. While I was driving he had another seizure, this one lasting a couple of minutes, and it was one of the most terrifying couple of minutes of my life. 

I got Ralph to the vet and by this point it was clear he was fading. His eyes were empty looking and he couldn‚Äôt lift his head. I was absolutely distraught at this point, sobbing and begging for help. The vet looked him over and gave him seizure meds for my sake but she suggested we euthanize him that morning. At his age, it wasn‚Äôt likely he was able to recover from whatever was causing the seizures and I‚Äôd only be causing him pain by keeping him around. 

I tried calling Charlie a few more times. Finally I gave up and sent him a text telling him what was up and how sorry I was. Ralph had suffered another seizure since arriving at the clinic and I knew it was time to let him go. It was very peaceful, just like he fell asleep in my arms. I paid for his remains to be cremated and ordered a lovely little urn to store his ashes. 

Surprisingly, I never got a text or call from Charlie. Instead, I woke up at 1 AM to him storming in and screaming at me for killing his cat. He drove all day to get here. He‚Äôs extremely upset and feels that I should have waited for him to respond before giving the OK to the vet. I told him that I tried to contact him many times before and after Ralph died, but I have to admit that he‚Äôs right‚Äî I did euthanize his cat without his consent and that was a pretty shitty thing to do. However, I maintain that I acted with Ralph‚Äôs best interest in mind.

Charlie stormed out to crash on a friend‚Äôs couch and I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. I feel guilty, but some part of me still believes his response is unwarranted. I‚Äôm trying to find a way to send him Ralph‚Äôs urn and ashes as a sort of olive branch, but I think I‚Äôve damaged our friendship beyond repair.

388,AITA for kicking out my niece because she broke my house rule of not using fatphobic language?,198,Not the A-hole,146,hp3kln,1594468865.0,"When, I was a kid, my mom and my older sister would talk a lot about their bodies. They would do things like call themselves fat or comment on how much I was eating. It was a very negative environment to grow up in, and by the time I was 25 I developed anorexia. 

Obviously I was doing terribly mentally and physically, but I ended up spending a year in a mental hospital and going into recovery. Almost 20 years later I have never relapsed into my unhealthy eating habits, but of course I still attend therapy. 

I had two daughters with my late husband.They are 12 and 10. I decided that I would make sure to raise them so that they would always love themselves and never hate their bodies. I pledged to never talk about my body or theirs in any negative way. I also banned language like that from my house.

Basically no fat shaming language is allowed, no commenting on anyone's eating, and no talking negatively about your body or others. And I never limit my daughters' eating. I know how hard it is in today's society to love your body so I put in place these rules to protect my daughters from what I experienced.

My older sister has a daughter, Sarah, who is 18. We live very far from each other so I only see her maybe twice a year, but my sister asked me if Sarah could come stay with us because she is taking an internship in our city. I said sure, and when she arrived I told her about our house rules.

Everything seemed understood and the first week went fine, but two days ago Sarah called herself fat in front of my daughters. I talked to her about it, explained why I had these rules, and asked her to stop. She seemed angry at me but she agreed and said she would.

Then yesterday Sarah said something to my younger daughter about how much ice cream she was eating. It seemed like a joke, but I again talked to her. Afterwards I also talked to both of my daughters about why Sarah's words weren't ok. They ended up telling me that when they had been alone with Sarah, she had said a lot more things like this, mostly about herself, but some about other people.

I went for a walk to clear my head and when I got home I overheard Sarah loudly talking to a friend on the phone about how her mom is getting fat. This was the final straw for me and I told Sarah to get out of my house. I offered to get her a hotel room for the night if she wanted. I just wanted her away from my daughters.

Of course I received a frantic phone call from my sister saying I was a bitch for kicking Sarah out and that the fatphobia I kicked her out for wasn't a thing. She also said that my behavior was the reason my youngest daughter is fat (she's a little overweight, but it's just baby fat). I think I was just protecting my daughters.

389,AITA for getting mad at my sister for having to take care of HER baby?,195,Not the A-hole,59,hosf0f,1594428533.0,"So I‚Äôm f20 and my sister is f24. My mom is 45 and my dad is 75. My sister got pregnant a little over a year ago and the moment i heard she was pregnant I was fucking pissed. I was angry cause she is irresponsible and lazy and I knew that I would end up having to do majority of work for the sake of the baby or my parents, which exactly is what happens all the time. 

My sister has it easy as a mother because my family helps her take care of the baby on a regular basis. My mom gives her baths everyday (she doesn‚Äôt even know how to give the baby a bath and she‚Äôs over 18 months old.) my parents also put the baby to sleep. Also she‚Äôll leave whenever she wants and any hour of the day, and come back whenever she wants and doesn‚Äôt even tell you when she‚Äôll be home, and she expects our parents to take care of her baby while she is gone. Because of this I end up staying with the baby a lot because my parents have other things to do or they‚Äôre just tired. 

In the nighttime I get my sister a bottle whenever she asks, I get her diapers from the other room if she ran out, basically helping my sister whenever she needs it with whatever and I don‚Äôt get anything in return. I don‚Äôt get money I don‚Äôt even get gratitude. 

Sister is back a work and works 7-8 hour shifts either day or night, but she never asks us if she can take on extra shifts or let‚Äôs us know if she‚Äôs staying longer. When she leaves for work, If it‚Äôs in the morning time I have to get up and watch the baby and take care of her, give her breakfast feed her (which is a goddamn nightmare) if she is working nights then I have to put the baby to sleep and watch her till my sister comes home. And I have to basically take care of her all day, play with her feed her. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the baby to death but I didn‚Äôt sign up to become a fucking parent. And whenever I get mad with her she always says that I don‚Äôt have to do anything it‚Äôs our parents who‚Äôs taking care of her (my parents say the same thing yet ask me for help every 10 minutes while also slightly complaining about having to take care of her? . But if my parents are tired and want to sleep or just do whatever you expect me to just sit aside and do nothing to help them? I don‚Äôt take my parents for granted like she does. My father is also 75, so if you don‚Äôt see my point then idk what will. 

So today she left for work at 8am, meaning she should have come home around 2 or 3, but when I text her she‚Äôs saying she‚Äôll be home at 8 cause she picked up an extra shift. I got angry cause then that‚Äôs more time I have to take care of her child. It‚Äôs not like she needs money so badly that she needs to be taking extra shifts, she doesn‚Äôt pay for anything for the baby my parents pay for EVERYTHING.

Ok so my first post was taken down because it exceeded the character limit, so sorry moderators!  Okay to keep it short 

Me- me 
EM- mother 

I was walking down in my residential complex. I wasn‚Äôt wearing anything revealing or outlandish. I wore baggy sweats and a baggy crop top that barely shows my stomach unless I raise my arms or something. I also do not personally know the mother or her kids 
 
EM walks up to me huffing with her small daughters in tow - what in the world do you think you‚Äôre wearing? Why are you walking around half naked? What kind of good Hindu girl does this? *curses* 

Me- excuse me? First of all I am allowed to wear what I wish, and I am not particularly religious FYI 

EM- oh excellent so a slut and a devil worshipper. I demand to know where you live and who your mother is. I think she needs to hear about what her daughter is doing and wearing. *curses*

I am 18 and live in India, a rather conservative place to say the least. 

Me- absolutely not ma‚Äôam, please let me continue my walk. 

Em- what a disrespectful little girl, how have your parents raised you? I doubt that they raised you to be unreligious and to walk around in your underwear! *curses* my daughters will grow up thinking that this is the correct way to dress. I demand that you be a good role model for them!

Again, I am wearing sweats and a baggy crop top. 

Me- excuse me ma‚Äôam. I live here, I am allowed to wear what I wish. I can show you what underwear looks like if you wish? I am also not responsible for being a role model for your daughters. Your parenting strategy is horrid if you rely on other people, strangers, to show your daughters guidance towards the ‚Äúcorrect path‚Äù 

Em- *curses again* you are an absolute disgrace to everyone. Go home and put on some CLOTHES 

Me- how about you let me continue on my walk, and if you do not want your children to grow up disrespectful and disgusting, like me, I suggest you stop cursing like a sailor and being horrid to strangers while they‚Äôre with you. Maybe that would set a good example for them. Thank you, see you around. 

I walk away while she continues to yell but I put on my music and start to jog away from this monster.

I'm 17(F) and my sibling(X) is a well-known celebrity from where I'm from. X values their privacy (I totally understand), but its causing me and my family to have to make several adjustments for X. It's been like that my whole life and I was okay with it, but my compromises have been building up and stirring a bit of negativity. 

X and I have a mutual friend (Y). I'm very close to Y, basically like siblings. I recently posted a picture with me and Y, but X caught wind and made me take it down, reasoning being that X doesn't want ppl to think they're dating (not). X found several other pictures of me and Y on my insta and made me take them down (over 40 pictures). 

I have a youtube channel and X makes me send a schedule of my filming to them weekly. If I accidentally shoot not on schedule and X is around, X lashes out at me. Same with Zoom meetings now during quarantine. Sometimes I can't help it, my friends call at times and X is there and gets mad. 

The worst one, X even decided where I would go for college and I'm going to a school abroad (again, X's absurd privacy reasons. It's a really nice school and my parents are paying (not X) and I got in on my own merit. But it's not where I want to be. 

X also doesn't want me to share any details about myself to my friends that could be perceived as negative thinking that it might come back to him and ruin his reputation (not likely). 

Before quarantine, X wanted my parents (by default me too) to come to vacation with X and their new S/O (Z) and Z's parents. X was a bit ashamed of our house and wanted to organize a lavish vacation for us to get to know each other. X and Z would be doing their own thing really. I didn't want to go with X because vacations with X are always the same, so many restrictions and we can't explore. I don't care about how many amenities the hotel freaking has, its all the same. 

I asked my parents if I could go with my friends and pay for my own vacation. It would be the same place, but I'll get to explore more and do more public things. I would, of course, spend some time with my family, but I wanted it to be my own vacation. X freaked out and said NO. X didn't want me casting a bad reputation on the family in front of Z and didn't want me to look ""poor"". X then said things about how I didn't want to spend time with X and was resentful of X's success and I was being an ungrateful little sister. X was so disappointed in me and then left home. My parents then got super angry with me after X left since they don't get to see X much (quarantine is now proving that wrong haha) and that I was being super ungrateful and rejecting what I have.

We have a very close-knit, mixed gender friend group and we are all extremely touchy-feely people. We all hug each other hello and goodbye, enjoy platonic cuddling, share beds, etc. Most of the group's S/Os understand this dynamic and doesn't mind but there have been instances where S/Os are uncomfortable and everyone respects their boundaries.

Damian started dating Kayla [24F] in December so we had been to a lot of outings and gatherings together before the lockdown started in March. When I first met her, she seemed really nice and friendly and was a great match for Damian, who's super fun and lively. He is one of the most touchy-feely people in our friend group so he's usually hanging off of someone, especially when he's drinking.

Kayla seemed okay with this at first, which was confirmed by Damian, but at one party, when Damian fell asleep on my shoulder, she snapped at me and snatched him away. I talked to Damian about it afterwards and he said they had a talk and she said she was just having a bad night and accidentally snapped but ultimately was fine with his touchiness. However, it kept happening. Put my feet in Damien's lap, I got a nasty look. Damian slings his arm around me, a snide comment, etc. It got to the point where if Damian went out with us without her, she'd be blowing up his phone the entire time. All the other girls in our friend group had similar experiences with her. Every time it happened, I'd talk to Damian about it and he said they talked, she apologized, etc. I eventually just backed away from all physical contact except for hugging hello and goodbye from Damian to avoid conflict. Then the lockdown hit, so it wasn't a huge issue.

It all came to a head last week when I saw her and Damian for the first time in person since the lockdown. We hugged hello very dramatically since it was the first time we'd been separated for that long of a time. She seemed fine with it at the time but when I got home, I had a very long, VERY nasty text waiting for me from Kayla, essentially telling me to back off and that I'm ""too unattractive for Damian to want to cheat with you so stop trying to tempt him."" I sent a screenshot to Damian and told him that I really hurt by her words and accusations and will no longer being seeing or communicating with either of them until she apologizes for her extremely hurtful words and changes her attitude or Damian starts setting hard boundaries because I'm sick of being caught in the middle. Damian has tried texting and calling me apologizing but Kayla won't budge. I haven't returned any of his calls or texts. My other friends think I'm being too harsh and to just let it go for Damian's sake and Damian has been calling me very upset because he doesn't want to lose our friendship but I'm really hurt. AITA?

UPDATE: Kayla, Damian, and I finally spoke over video chat this morning. Kayla apologized for her harsh language and revealed that she had been cheated on in her last relationship, which explains the lashing out and inconsistent boundaries due to not wanting to come off as the new ""crazy"", jealous girlfriend. I apologized for my role in not respecting her boundaries and not making her feel more welcomed into our friend group. Damian apologized for also not setting clear boundaries and for putting me and the other female friends in tough spots as he continued to try to initiate contact when it was clear that we didn't want to start conflicts between them. I do really like Kayla and hope that we can move on from this and form a better friendship. Thanks for all your feedback!",False,1594654174.0,2020-07-12 23:06:43

However I forgot to request some dipping sauce for my chicken, so once my delivery driver got the order I gave her a call to let her know. 

Her phone rang once then went straight to voicemail. Obvious ignore. A moment later I received a text message saying (copy-pasted):

Thanks for calling! Right now I‚Äôm driving either to a restaurant or to a delivery location. Feel free to text me and I‚Äôll respond once I‚Äôm no longer driving.

I thought this was pretty rude and silly, because no respectable employee would ignore a customer like that and no respectable business would allow their employees to do so. I immediately called her back, same thing happened. I called a third time, hoping she would get the hint. Still, same thing happened. I was frustrated and upset, so I cancelled my order. I wasn‚Äôt able to report the driver through the app since she never even picked up my order, so I ended up calling door dash support directly to let them know that a driver was ignoring me. All they said was they‚Äôd take care of it. 

A bit later my girlfriend was wondering where our food was, so I explained the whole situation. She looked confused and asked why I didn‚Äôt just text her like the message said, and I told her that it was a matter of principle‚ÄîI am the customer and the driver doesn‚Äôt get to pick and choose how to do her job.

Here's the problem. I let her borrow my phone in the morning, and I use it at night, and vice versa. But she has been using it nonstop for 4 days now, and I as a gen Z'er am very much dependent on social media, mostly using it as a distraction from certain thoughts. 

I got frustrated and got into a fight with my mom because she wont let me use MY phone that SHE IS BORROWING. I have not touched my phone in days. I take it from her forcefully and tell her repeatedly that she can use it again tomorrow. I want to have some me time with my phone.

I was dating someone for a short while who was in school for Animation. He kept a personal sketchbook, and most of the sketches he drew were of womens bodies. I found it interesting to say the least, but it's not my place to tell someone what to draw.

It was long distance, and during this time we had exchanged nudes. At one point he sent me a couple sketches he had drawn. Of my nudes, face included. At the time I found it kind of sweet, considering I was insecure of how I looked, and didn't think much of it 

I broke up with him because the long distance was causing me to lose feelings. I felt bad, but I tried my best to put it gently and had hoped we could still remain civil, if not friends. Everything seemed to be okay for a few weeks, until I came across his art instagram. One of his posts included the pictures of my nudes, and anyone who knew me (we had multiple mutual friends) would be able to tell it was me because my face/hair was included. 

Honestly, I lost it. I messaged him and DEMANDED he take it down, and that I was not comfortable with it. He complied, but after that incident he began acting like an absolute jerk. I said something about me liking a certain Netflix show, and he pm'd me saying, ""That show is SHIT and you should feel like shit for liking it."" After that, I blocked him.

I helped her with the door and asked about them. I'm a huge reader and love getting new books. The neighbor told me that she'd been planning on dropping them off at a charity shop, but I could have them instead if I wanted them. I said, yes please! And lugged them back upstairs.

My husband gave me the 'oh no, not more books!' look, but being the wonderful man that he is, helped me go through them. None of them were really my thing, a lot of political and language books, but one was published in 1899. We decided to look up the value of it and were amazed to see ¬£50+ (we're in the UK). We looked up the other books and found that we're sitting on about ¬£400 if we sell them on Amazon or eBay.

AITAH if we sell them and keep the money? I'm not even sure of my neighbor's name or flat number (it's a big building) and the charity shop would sell them for ¬£2-3.

I'm definitely quitting that specific job/position.  I'm applying to the same position in different departments or stores. I feel fairly confident I will get one. My job is hard to train for and considered a specialist role. So the fact that I'm already trained and know how to use the appropriate tools and software should work massively in my favor in searching for another job in this company. 

Yes the leader of my store is a good guy. I have reached out to him and he is supportive and understanding in my applications to other departments and stores. He said he wont try to convince me to stay, but will do his best to work with my DM to ensure this doesn't happen again or he's going the same way as the last one. 

Apologies in advance on mobile. Here's context. 

I work at a grocery store. The direct hierarchy goes:
Store Managers>Department Manager(DM)>Assistant deperarment manager(ADM)>Me>Supervisors>Floor workers. 

I was hired into my position from a different department in December. My DM did not invest much time into my training, so at best I was half trained.(it turned out that half of what they taught me directly contradicts company guidelines) 

About a week before Corona got serious where I am(March) my DM was fired. This was definitely a good thing as they were emotionally and verbally abusive to everyone under them. Unfortunately no one actually wanted this position after them. 

Our ADM was already in the process of transferring to a different location closer to home. So 16 days later, they were gone too. 
Luckily(or so I thought) there was an ADM at a different store who wanted this position.

During his time of his leaving, coronavirus got big here. Most of our supervisors and better team members took an extended leave of absence. 

During the next 3 months our new ADM hid in the office and offered no leadership or training of any kind to the team. The only tangible thing he produced was a schedule for the department. Even that was rife with problems. 

I was already in charge of buying, receiving, merchandising for sales, and maintaining financial profitability as part of my normal job duties. In the complete and total lack of leadership I took on managing production, the floor staff, Inventory, signage, stocking, and literally everything other ball he dropped.

Fast forward to late last month. We finally get someone from another(much bigger) store who is interested in the DM position. He applies and gets it. He has a scheduled vacation for 2 weeks so it takes a bit longer for him to get here, nbd, I've done it this long. ADM decides that he needs a vacation, as soon as the new manager starts. Literally the first day of his vacation was the new DMs start date. 

So here I am left alone to explain the fucking mess left of our department to someone who is unforgiving with high expectations.  

It's been a week and I've been handed extra projects in addition to all my normal and taken on duties. 

All I have received is criticism on the state of the department, lectures on 'how we do things', and then reprimands for STAYING LATE to finish my normal duties because all my time has been eaten up by his projects and lectures. 

I lost it. I cried at my desk for a few minutes. Finished all my tasks for the day and went home.

The ADM is back from vacation. I normally have Wednesdays and Sundays off. Last night I called the store manager and told him I was ready to quit and that I need the next few days off. He said that's fine, take care of yourself, we cbs talk about it Monday. 

The more I think about it, the more done I am.

For the most part, we stick to generic brands for pantry items and we've saved quite a bit of money along the way. (I would like to take this moment to also point out that there have been exceptions with certain items)

My wife is going to try making Pad Thai for the first time tonight. Yesterday, she went shopping for the supplies. As I was pulling out the ingredients to help her get set up I noticed that she had bought the generic brand of sriracha sauce. I froze in place and she asked what was wrong so I explained that we would probably want the green bottle sriracha sauce (the ones I see in restaurants).

I volunteered to go and grab a new bottle myself from the store so that she didn't have to but she got upset and left to go get the new bottle of sriracha. I feel really bad but it's just one of those things... AITA?

EDIT: So thank you to everyone for your feedback. I feel it's important to note that I was not at all angry with my wife when I mentioned this. And there seems to be a great deal of comments regarding my ""freezing in place"". I only stopped this way because I had never seen another kind of sriracha before so it never occurred to me to be specific about which kind. Thank you all for letting me know that I owe my wife some serious apology and I will be sure not to handle similar situations the same going forward.  


UPDATE: Wife came back from the store a few minutes ago and was surprised that I was apologizing. She said that she was flustered because getting the dinner prepped was exciting but stressful. I asked why she didn't let me go and get the sauce myself and it turns out she forgot another ingredient and just wanted go grab it anyway. I still feel bad and I'll still find a way to make it up to her. But dinner's smelling great so far!!!  Thanks guys!",False,1594769127.0,2020-07-14 23:30:58

After a call from his doctor, my dad has been constantly grilling us about watching what we eat due to our family history of diabetes. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and 114 lbs and consider myself to be relatively healthy. My sister is around my build, too. While we find his complaining annoying, we agreed to adjust our diet to include more vegetables and start exercising 1-2 hours every day. 

Over the past week, my dad has been picking on my sister about her body to the point where she locks herself in her room and cries. (While she is sensitive and does not take criticism well, I still think what my dad said was out of line and uncalled for.) This is also around the same time he bought two tubs of ice cream which he pretty much ate all by himself and then accused my sister for eating too much sugar. 

Yesterday, our family decided on having sandwiches for dinner. I made a veggie sandwich (ciabatta bread, avocado, spinach, mushroom, and a slice of mozzarella). My dad made a comment on my meal, saying that I was going to gain weight by eating all of it. He was eating a ham sandwich and then went back for a second helping of rice. 

Which brings me to today. I made the same sandwich again because it tasted really good and my sister has yet to try it. My dad told me I should eat half of it to (again) not gain weight. This is where I might have been/am the AH. I told him that I might as well not eat at all. That offended him and he told me to leave the table, and I did. 

For starters, I skipped breakfast and was really hungry by the time lunch came around. And when my stomach starts growling, my sass levels rise. 

Second, my dad and I (including my sis) already have a strained relationship. Because my parents work a lot, they rarely check in on us. My dad doesn‚Äôt know my weight. Heck, he barely knows my own birthday. He just takes one look and assumes he knows everything. 

Third, he exercises, but he only does crunches for 20 minutes while me and my sister have a routine that works on all areas. Because of all these reasons, I just snapped. And as usual, he refuses to talk to me whenever there is conflict.

409,AITA for taking away my brother's food delivery privileges?,169,Not the A-hole,33,howjar,1594441706.0,"Hi.

I have a food delivery app that I pay the premium feature for. In the premium feature, all delivery costs are taken care of which is a really sweet deal. I pay for the premium feature by myself. Recently, my younger brother asked me if he could put his credit card on my account, so that he could use the premium feature that I pay for. I said absolutely, no problem at all. He's 18, and I make more money than him so it is not an issue. This worked well, he always used his card to pay for his food, and since I still use the service a lot, I didn't mind paying for his delivery, in a way.

Since my phone number is the one linked to my account, I started getting a ton of notifications of deliveries, but they were always made with my brother's card, so I didn't think much of it. It wasn't until I saw that there were 2 other cards whose number I didn't recognize on my account. I deleted the cards. Or so I thought. I started getting 2-3 notifications of deliveries a day, made with those cards. I asked my brother about it, and in turns out that he had told his friends that my account gets free delivery, so they want to take advantage of the deal, save some money, and order their meals in my account. 

It bothered me a lot. His friends have been piggybacking on my premium feature that I pay for. It feels completely illegal, and I don't want my account taken away. I asked him to delete my account on his phone, changed my password, and removed all but my credit card.

He got really angry. He claims that it doesn't affect me at all, since I am paying the same amount for the premium feature every month, regardless of the amount of orders that I (or anyone else) makes, which is true. Still, I feel like he violated my trust, and I am not okay with this, because it feels really illegal. All of his friends are adults, and I feel like they could pay for their own premium accounts, or pay for the delivery costs. I told him that I was previously okay with him using the account, but since he violated my trust I wasn't okay with him using it anymore. He called me selfish and refuses to talk to me.

Backstory: 

In March before the shutdown in my state was initiated, I took a trip to my mom's house with the intent to stay there until I leave for graduate school. The entire time I had been staying there, my step-dad and my brother were ridiculing me for taking precautions and generally not bothering with precautions themselves. 

In May, my brother went to a barbecue party with some friends.  When he came home, he was REALLY sick. Then I got sick.  I missed out on about 4 weeks of pay. I was unable to get tested, but my step-dad assured me that it wasn't COVID19, that I was blowing things out of proportion. At the end of July, I left my mom's house to find some temporary shelter near where I used to live so that I could safely shelter-in-place. I told my parents that I would like to leave until the risk of transmitting and spreading the virus is minimized. 

Apparently cases in my state had been decreasing. My mom has been begging me to come back. I even thought about it and told her that. But recently, there has been a major spike again, particularly on her side of the state. I found out from my mom that my brother had spent several days in the emergency room. Again, they assured me that this activity is ""definitely not related to the virus."" 

&#x200B;

Why I feel like an AH: 

My mom wants me to help her take care of my brother. She says he's in a lot of pain, that he's struggling.  I get that - but just given the events, I have reason to believe he got me sick in the first place. I don't want to have to risk my health again to take care of him - make him meals and clean. I have to work. Additionally, I really did not appreciate being mocked by my step-dad for washing down counters. (He said he thought it was all ""security theater.) My mom also claims a physician from the emergency department told her that our state is over-testing... the reason I turned off my phone last night.  While she never mocked me and I know that she needs help, I just don't see why my step-dad couldn't also provide her with support. 

&#x200B;

So I'm staying where I am... but I can't help feeling pretty selfish for doing so. Does this make me an AH? Thanks, y'all.",False,False,2020-07-13 20:11:25
411,AITA for not helping my daughter makes friends?,167,Not the A-hole,34,hpajmq,1594505224.0,"I have no idea what to do, I made a reddit account just for this. I've been looking at this site for a while and I hope you can help me figure this out.

To start off with, we're pretty friendly with the family across from us. They have a boy named Tommy who is the same age as our daughter, Amy. Tommy's mother and I were pregnant at the same time and she is planning to be a stay-at-home mom when the baby was born. I, on the other hand was planning on returning to work a year or two after Amy was born. When I was trying to work out the childcare, Tommy's mother offered to sit for us (with compensation of course) and my husband and I gladly accepted.

This year, the kids are turning six and they're absolutely best friends. Amy wants to spend all her time with Tommy, which is fair, considering they spent a lot of time together growing up. The problem is my husband, he's been trying to get her to be friends with his coworkers kids. Last year, he was taking her to birthday parties and playdates with the coworkers kids to try and make friends with them. The few times I was present at the playdates at our house, Amy was not interested in playing with any of the girls, but had a great time with the boys. One time I suggested that we include Tommy in one of the playdates with the boys and my husband shut it down instantly.

With COVID, my husband started working from home and my hours were cut at my job. (I'm a manager at a restaurant, we switched to take-out only.) Whenever I'm home, Amy always asks if she can go visit Tommy. I said no the first couple of times, but when she kept asking, I figured why not. I made the necessary precautions and went her to visit Tommy across the street. I made an offhand comment to Tommy's mother that she spends all her time with him, when his mother told me that she hasn't been over since lockdown started.

I confront my husband and he tells me he doesn't want to pay Tommy's parents for childcare when he's home all day anyway. I figured that was fair and left it alone and took Amy to see Tommy every week or so.

Then the restrictions started getting lifted and my husband tells me he was invited to one of his coworker's kids birthday parties and tells me he wants to take Amy. Amy happened to hear this and told us that she doesn't like being at this particular kid's party and that she does not want to go. I asked her why and she told me that all the kids there are much older than her and she's treated like a baby. I finally get my husband to confess that the kid is turning twelve. He tells me that the reason he's bringing her to these parties is because they're all girl parties. He then tells me that Amy should be having girls as friends instead of boys.

It's true that she has a lot of interests that are ""boyish"" but she likes ""girly"" things too. But maybe my husband is right and she may have trouble making friends with girls later in life. AITA?

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for your judgement. I showed this to my husband this morning. He was pretty disturbed by the few people calling him manipulative, controlling, etc. and to be fair, you only know one side of the story. My husband and I make a wonderful team, we communicate with each other and want what's best for us and our family. This is one of the few times we did not communicate properly. 

For one thing, he's very close to his coworkers, he goes out to drink with them and even had a few parties at my restaurant with them. He told me this morning that what brought this controlling behavior on was when one of his female coworkers said that she liked a lot of ""boyish"" things when she was a child (maybe 70s, 80s) and she was an outcast among both groups because she had nothing in common with the girls and the boys wouldn't play with her since they had the mindset of ""girls are icky."" Reading all the comments about how Amy will make friends with kids at any age did put his mind at ease so I thank you.

We did both agree that Amy will benefit from having more friends to play with so we've decided to invite over a pair of his coworker's kids, a brother and sister that seemed to get along with her when they visited. We also agreed to include Tommy in this playdate and we are going to make plans to spend more time with his parents to help improve our relationship with them and Amy and Tommy's friendship. Someone also suggested that we sign Amy up for some clubs for kids to help her make more friends. I may end up doing that when COVID dies down. ",False,1594561131.0,2020-07-11 15:07:04

I'm AFAB and grew up with the whole ""Daddy's Girl"" dynamic that only started to be a problem when I became a teenager and started dating my high school boyfriend. (Looking back, I'm seeing a lot of toxic shit my dad did when I was a kid that I just thought was parenting).

Anyway, we were rocky, but we did okay until the last year or two. I moved out of state to be with my current boyfriend, and in doing so, somehow insulted him. On top of that, I came out as Nonbinary when I moved up here because living with my boyfriend made me feel SAFE. My father and I have since disagreed about  many fundamental things that I wasn't quiet about before. He keeps saying things like ""I'm glad you found something that you THINK is important. I just disagree."" 

Fast forward to fathers day, when I called him to tell him Happy Father's Day, and that I loved him and he said a quick ""Okay, thanks."" And hung up on me. So, I called the rest of the fathers in my life and told them happy father's day and talked to them. My grandfather told me that when he spoke to my father, my father had gone on a whole ""woe, is me"" spiel about he has no daughter and how ""it""(me) couldn't possibly be who he raised ""it"" to be.

I cried. I processed. And then I reached out to my father to ask him how we could repair the relationship. He said I had to ""take back"" coming out and that I wasn't allowed to argue with him anymore. I said that I was an adult and that being nonbinary was who I was and he responded with a pretty abrupt ""Fuck you""

I decided that I was going to change my last name then. He doesn't want me as a child? I'll change my name.

I'm taking my mother's maiden name. (They're divorced and she has been really supportive for EVERYTHING I've been through). It's also the last name of the grandfather who I am closest to. He's very touched.

After H asked me I told her I had plans with my girlfriend and that I'd need some sort of compensation in order for us to cancel our plans.

H then started telling at me about the fact that I ""need so much money to spend time with my nephew's"" I told her that watching her children was way more than spending time with them, given that she herself complains about how poorly behaved her children are.

H then told me that she didn't have enough money to pay me 40 dollars. I told H that if she didn't have enough money to pay her babysitter roughly 1 dollar an hour she doesn't have the money to go camping for the weekend.

H and T have been together for 2 years and they have been seriously considering marriage lately, T has consistently made no effort to being an actual parent to them and doesn't ever seen to realize that H and her kids are a package deal.

414,AITA for refusing my brother's request to not speak to his ex-wife about my nephew?,164,Not the A-hole,30,hp8ad2,1594494650.0,"In January my brother asked my mother and I to stop speaking to his ex-wife, the mother of one his children. My brother stated that he made this request after a long brutal divorce with both my brother and his ex-wife fighting in court and outside court. The divorce was triggered after my bother regularly cheated on his ex-wife.  According to my brother, his ex-wife was using my communications as proof during child custody proceedings that she should have more legal/physical custody and that my nephew could continue to see our side of the family. 

I told my brother that I understood his request and I would certainly limit all of the communications for both legal and personal reasons at his request. My thought was to limit communications to holiday greetings and discussing the children since the ex-wife takes care of the children more often.  It surprised me that a court would use vacation scheduling  take away parental rights of my brother, I asked to have my intentions explained in the court. I asked to continue having limited communications for the following reasons:  

1. My brother's ex-wife coordinates mostly all of the communication with my nephew and visits. In other words, if I wanted to see my nephew, I HAD to coordinate with my brother's ex-wife. In fact in the past, my brother stated as much that I should coordinate the whole visit with my brother's ex-wife.
2. My brother has exhibited controlling behavior that borderlines on being abusive both during and after the relationship with his ex-wife and his current girlfriend (GF) (my brother cheated on his ex with his current GF and now has another child with his current GF). I did not want to be part of the abuse cycle. Plus, I wanted to send a signal to his current GF that I would not participate in the same thing if it were her. Oddly, enough she cut us off first! 

My brother gave me an ultimate of his ex-wife or him (and his current GF with a new baby). I asked him to reconsider with another approach. When he would not,I told him I could not honestly say that I would NEVER talk to his ex-wife again. 

NOTE: I am happily married with three children. I want my children to know their cousins (one nephew with the ex and one nephew with his current girlfriend).

My daughter is normally very patient with him but this time he wouldn‚Äôt give her toy back. She then decided to yank it back by sticking her arm between the gaps of the fence. She then sat with her back against the fence and played with her toys. She just stopped playing with him and ignored him but this upset him greatly and so he tried to get her back for not playing. He then took out his penis and peed straight on to her head. My daughter lost it and was so angry that she couldn‚Äôt even formulate any words. He ran into his home. 

She just walked angrily up and down the balcony muttering things to herself. She then peed in her toy bucket and waited while still wet with his piss. She waited until he got close enough and it didn‚Äôt take long, it took less then a minute before he was close enough and she dumped the bucket of piss over his head. She then walked in the our home shouting ‚Äúmom I pied on him and don‚Äôt care if I get punished.‚Äù She then explained everything to me and I then checked my security camera to see what happened.
About 20/30 minutes later or so the boys mother was screeching from her balcony that I should punish my child for peeing on her kid. I told her that her kid started it and my kid finished it. She was adamant my kid was the one who started it. I showed her my security camera recording. She then said that I needed to punish my kid too teach the kids that they were both wrong.

I (30f) was asked by my partners cousins Fianc√© to do her makeup for her wedding (I did a course in makeup artistry when I was 16 and never finished it because it wasn‚Äôt my thing and I also had chronic health issues that made it hard to go to class every day). 

Anyway this woman asked me if I could do her makeup, and in return she would buy a piece of my art. (I was a bit weirded out by this part and should have seen a red flag there...) anyway I told her I don‚Äôt really do it but she was persistent so I said ok. 

Also - I have a chronic illness that strikes at any time and effects my energy, and causes pain. (Everyone in his family knows this). I can still do some stuff but i have limitations and have to sort of conserve my energy. We had family staying with us and it started to really drain me and i started to have a flare up. Sadly I had to message her and tell her that I couldn‚Äôt do her makeup as I was feeling really lousy.. I wanted to go to the wedding though as it was Thier special and I didn‚Äôt want to miss it. I ended up going to the wedding and she ignored me and was super cold towards me when she talked with my partner. Anyway we left early as I wasn‚Äôt well and needed to rest so we said goodbye, and  I could tell she was pissed (it looks could kill) even if she didn‚Äôt say anything. 

She never said anything to me but my partner and I used to go out with them a few times a year but that flat out stopped after the wedding and now every time I have seen her since she has been icy as hell and doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me.


Maybe I‚Äôm being paranoid or overthinking it... but as I‚Äôve had major surgeries in the past and she knows I have a severe chronic illness, that she might have a backup plan. Also she never wanted a practice makeup or anything and had never seen any makeup I had done except on myself so she was kinda taking a big risk there too.

Also a big note she is a super money conscious and thrifty person even though she and her husband makes a really good salary. But I was ok for doing it for free because its family..

I really connected with her in many levels and one thing that I appreciated was our promise to keep each other in check, look out for each other, and ‚Äòbros before hoes‚Äô/‚Äòsisters before misters‚Äô sort of deal, because in her past relationships, she would entirely ignore me when her bf was around. I thought she changed, until she got into another relationship with my guy friend. She didn‚Äôt change at all, ignored me constantly, and left me on read.

I‚Äôm not one to confront my problems but, I decided to let her know, and I admit that I was very blunt. I told her my frustration. It was if she entirely forgot what we promised each other. She ended up being really understanding, apologetic for the first time. We hugged it out later, and I felt a lot better.

Months after, nothing changed. During quarantine, I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone for a good week (this problem+personal problems), but still posted on my ig story (ACNH stuff). She ended up blasting me on her snap saying ‚Äúall my friends are fake‚Äù, which lead me to prove that with my whole week break was a test that she wouldn‚Äôt ever care to talk to me first unless I did.

I decided to message my guy friend/her boyfriend. He always went to me about their problems and advice, and I was always there to help because they fought constantly at the start. Because of it, I‚Äôd let her know that I was concerned for her relationship because I didn‚Äôt want her to fall into toxicity again. 

I asked him how Ellie was and how she was feeling (because of that snap), and proceeded to tell him how I felt about us. He didn‚Äôt take it well. He called me rude and selfish for messaging him instead of her, and how going through to the boyfriend instead of the person was a dumb move.

The day after I messaged him, Ellie sent me text, and to be fair, she was just as blunt. She said that I‚Äôve been problematic, I‚Äôve been selfish, and have been butting into her relationship. She said I involved myself too much and whenever I told her I was worrying about her relationship, she was annoyed and uncomfortable. She said that of course she‚Äôs going to care about her boyfriend more, and even thought all of my social media posts during that week was to shove in her face about how well I‚Äôm doing while she isn‚Äôt, hence why she ended up never messaging me. Ellie even said that everything she told me during our last talk wasn‚Äôt 100% sincere, and she only said it to please me.

Apparently she reached out to our whole friend group about us, and everyone is on her side, mad at me without ever reaching out about my side of the story.

Turned out it was a pinched nerve  and treatable.

At the time I had a long discussion with the vet about quality of life and, it was important to me that I not keep my dog here for me if he no longer had quality of life since my dog was (is) deaf with cateracts and arthritis. I was advised to identify the top things he loves to do and when they start to be impossible for him I should consider letting him go.

Well those things are ticking down. If I had the money I would be at the vet today.

He always talks about how I am going to mange the dog when I move out and so on. He thinks the dog is not that bad off, yet he can no longer get in a car, jump on the bed or play with kids, eating is all he has left.

It's for our school's volunteer work requirement but it's a really nice thing to do anyway and we've continued with it after our school dropped the volunteer work requirement to graduate because of covid.

Even though I'm the organizer, it's an informal thing, it's me and six other high schoolers, I am not like a boss to them, I do all the same work as them, my job is mainly just organising days to meet. 

One of the girls, Jess, is a friend of mine and her parents always make her bring her little 10 year old brother. She hates having to babysit all the time so her parents can just sit at home and do nothing.

She said she's been trying to get them to stop but they won't listen to her and it's gotten worse after covid. Before that at least she could go to school and to soccer practice alone but now she's not allowed to do anything alone because she has to babysit her brother. 

It made me mad that she has been treated like the mom of her brother because her actual mom and dad can't step up.

So I wrote a very stern formal letter, as the organizer of the local trail cleanup organization saying that I had become aware that they were sending a 10 year old along with their 17 year old daughter to events, and we had to inform them that the events had a lower age limit of 16, unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. That it wasn't acceptable to send young unaccompanied minors on challenging hikes without ensuring the group had someone trained in the supervision of children, which we did not.

I had my aunt who's a business manager and who is really good at writing formal letters look it over and make some edits to make it sound really legit and official.

I didn't mention in my email that im just 18 and that this is just an informal group, I really acted like I'm some leader of a really legit group. 

And I didn't mention that the rule about ages didn't exist before they started making Jess bring her brother everywhere. But it is a rule now, and one that I think is smart to have anyway.

Apparently it worked, Jess's parents bought it and apparently didn't try to push back because they were worried they'd be in trouble for having already sent their younger kid to events unsupervised. 

Jess has kept coming to events, she said her parents don't know it's no longer a requirement to graduate high school. And I've been happy it worked but I'm also a little stressed about it being found out that I'm not some older club official of a serious club, I'm just a high school kid who's organized some informal volunteering.

Basically, one day at lunch a friend of mine (We‚Äôll call him James) brought a really elaborately cooked meal. I can‚Äôt remember exactly what but it was around the level of sushi or something that you could feasibly make at home but is generally considered difficult. My other friend (We‚Äôll call him Jeremy) and I complimented James on making this hard meal himself and he said that he was glad he had been learning to cook for so long since it‚Äôll be a handy skill when he leaves home for college soon. 

I have been cooking for my family since I was about 12 since both my parents worked full time and I wanted to help them out. Along with cooking, I also do most if not all of the cleaning just to take pressure off my parents. So to me, what James said was very understandable as the skills I have learned from cooking and taking care of a house are going to be really helpful when I move out. 

Jeremy said he was worried about leaving home because he doesn‚Äôt have much experience with cooking or cleaning because his Dad is a stay at home parent who does most of that, but said that he was trying to at least get the basics. The real problem was our other friend who I‚Äôll call Amy. As soon as we started talking about cooking, Amy seemed to almost brag about how she had no practical life skills.

422,AITA for not vacating my apartment while the landlord's realtor is here?,157,Not the A-hole,45,hpcc2n,1594511859.0,"A bit of background. My fiancee and I, as well as another couple, have been splitting a two-bedroom apartment in a small, four-apartment complex for about two and a half years. We all work a variety of shifts first through third and generally we've never had any real problems with the landlords. 

A couple weeks back however, they started exorcising their right to enter our apartment with 48 hours prior notice, as per the contract we signed when we moved in. This happened twice, with a realtor coming with them the second time and randomly taking photographs of our apartment. We inquired about what was going on, and were told very promptly not to worry about it.

Then, two days ago, we get a call from the realtor--not the landlords--who tells us that she needs us to vacate our apartment for roughly a span of five hours over the weekend so she can show the apartment to perspective buyers. Perplexed, we called the landlords, who finally inform us that they are selling the complex. In short, they want everyone up and out of their apartments, even those who would normally be asleep at that time. We are further notified that they expect the same from 4-7 PM on Monday evening. In edition, the realtor has been given keys to our apartment and permission from the landlords to enter whenever she likes.

Thus far, we have refused to vacate. This is our private home that we pay to live in. With everything going on across the world right now, we really don't even want them in here (our contract states that only our landlord's can force an issue of entry), but past our initial year contract, we've been renting on a month-to-month basis and don't want the landlord to get pissy and find a reason to evict us. This might not even matter, in the end, as we've come to find out that there's a good chance everyone who lives in the complex could get evicted at short notice depending on the buyer, and that they avoided telling anyone what was actually going on because it looks better to the buyer if people live here.

Me (M38) and my girlfriend of 2.5 years (""A"" 35) have recently decided that she and her daughter (""K."" 13) were going to move into my apartment. We are planning on moving into an actual house in 2021 or early 2022, but my apartment will have to make do for the time being. K. Wasn't happy about that, but reluctantly complied in the end. I was never close with K., we do not interact with each other a lot, but I think we're both pretty content with that, as she doesn't show any further interest in me whatsoever. That's ok.

The main one being that she keeps going into my fridge, taking everything & anything she pleases without asking or informing me in any sort of way. I do most of the cooking and virtually all of the shopping in my household, so I find it to be very infuriating to find that some of my ingredients are just being eaten without my knowledge. 

I tried to talk to her about it and she told me that I'm being ridiculous, since neither me or her mom even cook dinner (which is part of my current lifestyle) and she doesn't get to eat the lunch I cook because she's at school (She refuses to eat any leftovers so I stopped cooking extra).  
Basically, she wants me to buy her enough groceries so she can feed herself, which I am not willing to, as I do not want to spend any more money on the abundance of groceries that I already am, which is more than enough, mind you. All I want from her is to tell me about the ingredients that she's taking, or better, ask me about taking them. She left the conversation without saying another word, and instead complained to her mother about me.

A. is mad at me because I do not make her daughter feel at home and try to control and restrict her. (A. is very lenient in her parenting methods and does NOT see where I am coming from)  
K is apparently very sad about the move and misses being close to her friends (which she also brings over without my permission). This doesn't change anything for me, though.

424,AITA for taking baby food from a pantry for myself as an adult [34F]?,157,Asshole,245,hph8a2,1594528573.0,"Mick (27M) & I have been together for about 2 years.

In the last year, times have been rough, and I started to get our food from pantries.  I got into that routine and have a pantry calendar to optimize hauls.  Overall, we get a ton of free healthy food.

I have chronic illnesses, including gastroparesis.  Gastroparesis is painful delayed stomach emptying.  Medications are not helpful, and most of what I consume is liquid.  It can get very expensive and time-consuming having to turn everything into a broth or juice, as one needs a ton of inputs per any wanted output.  

I cannot digest plant fiber, fat, or protein without having it broken down.  It's very hard to stay satiated and have enough nourishment.  Snacking on easily digestible foods is important.  I usually have nut butter, applesauce, yogurt, and saltine crackers.  Smoothies are hard for my body to digest.  I always transport digestible foods with me and learned that baby food is an easy go-to years ago.

My neighborhood charity has a daily ""grab and go"" section (outdoors on tables) when they're closed.  Oftentimes, trucks deliver food on the off hours and pantry-goers donate what they don't want from their own pantry hauls.  I like to go after close and see what's available. 

My boyfriend, Mick, finally went to the pantry with me.  When we arrived shortly after close and started to look through the items, I came across an entire crate of organic baby food.  I was stoked, and planned to take about half.  Mick saw me loading up baby food and was appalled.  After I loaded some jars, another pantry-goer came up to look around.  I moved away from the baby food in case the woman needed some.  She didn't take any.  

Mick made condescending comments about me ""needing to tell him something"" knowing I have an IUD to shame me.  He said it doesn't matter if that lady wanted baby food or not, it's wrong to take it because I'm not a parent or baby.  I disagreed, saying it was donated and left outside. ""Baby food"" specifically is packaging, for all intents and purposes.  Many items could be ""baby food"" with different labeling, but they are marketed to adults.  He countered by saying that's how I know if a product is suited to me or not.

I have a very sensitive stomach and am perpetually malnourished.  Having baby food for a little nutrition is helpful because it's a safe, reliable food.  Very few foods qualify, and they are typically very expensive. 

Mick says that I am literally taking food from hungry babies.  I do agree in some ways, but I also don't think it's that simple.  I don't want babies to starve and I need to be able to eat *something.*  This one is tough for me.

So Reddit, AITA for taking baby food for myself?

Edit:  I make bone broth, fruit & vegetable juice, and nut milk, plus consume nutritional drinks.  ""Snacks"" (aka meals to me) might be a bit of applesauce, a couple saltine crackers, or a teaspoon of peanut butter.  With gastroparesis you don't really eat many ""meal-sized portions""  and must get a little nutrition in every couple hours to stay conscious.  It takes a long time for the liquid/food in my stomach to move along, thus I'm very prone to hypoglycemic episodes *and* syncope from dehydration (low blood volume) and electrolyte imbalances.  

Blending and pureeing are *absolutely* staples.  I have a blender and frequently use it.  However, *most* foods cannot simply be blended and be gastroparesis-friendly  I wish it were that simple, but unfortunately that's just absolutely not the case.  When I'm too tired to juice, sometimes I make a smoothie and despite straining it, can only handle a couple ounces.  The ""wrong"" blended foods, or foods period, *absolutely* exacerbate gastroparesis and can easily block absorption of everything else for the next 12-24+ hours while the undigested food sits in one's guts. 

Edit 2:  For full transparency, I got an exact count of the baby food I took.  Most items are past expiration date; 3 are not.  It's less than my estimate in the comments.  Full list*:

- (1) Gerber 2-pack ""sitter 2nd foods"" carrot 
- (1) Gerber ""sitter 2nd foods"" ham and gravy
- (1) Beech Nut Naturals ""stage 1"" carrots
- (1) Beech Nut Organics ""stage 1"" pumpkin
- (1) Beech Nut Organics ""stage 2""  apple, kiwi, and spinach
- (3) Beech Nut ""stage 1"" beef + beef broth
- (1) Beech Nut ""stage 1"" chicken + broth
- (1) Beech Nut Classics ""stage 1"" turkey + turkey broth

*I also inadvertently brought home an 8-pack of glass infant formula jars from the crate and brought it back to the pantry the next time.  

Edit 3: I cannot afford to buy baby food (and other easily digestible items).  I have not been to a grocery store in 9 months.  There isn't money for it.  That is why I go to the food pantries, because I cannot afford food.  Buying my own baby food is not an option for me.  Trust me, I'd love to ""just stop being poor.""

Edit 4: Well, that sucks.  I violated Rule 3 and got myself suspended for 3 days.  Sorry for arguing, that wasn't my intention.  Thank you for the ongoing conversation and comments.  I appreciate everyone's perspectives, even if I'm an/the AH.  Nobody wants to be an asshole, especially when it comes to nutrition and the most precious and vulnerable in society.  I'm truly trying to learn what is and isn't acceptable in this particular (ongoing) scenario.  That's not my last pantry visit, certainly, and I don't want to be TAH moving forward.",False,1594624988.0,2020-07-11 21:36:13

She stuck to her guns.¬† She wouldn't go to the highest ranked school or the school where she got the fellowship, but insisted on going to the medium ranked school.¬† She was an adult, and I couldn't stop her.¬†¬†If we couldn't afford it, she would take loans.¬† I am against student loans, as she well knows.

After many hours of discussion, I told her I would pay for either of the other two schools, but if she chose to go to the most expensive college, I wouldn't support that decision financially, and I would roll college money I planned on using for her down to her siblings. I can't say that I feel good about it, but I can't support her decision.¬†  **EDIT: I can use this money in other ways, like to pay for graduate school or weddings or house downpayments, or even college for grandkids.**

So, am I the asshole for refusing to help her pay for an expensive college that I don't think is a good investment in her future?

EDIT:  Everyone, thanks for commenting.  Many of you are asking questions which ask me to defend my position, but I have been reminded by the mods of Rule 3, which says I should not ""draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject.""   I will answer informational questions,  but I have been told not to debate this or I will be muted.   Thanks again for your input.

Every year there's a game on my birthday. I haven't celebrated my birthday for the past five years due to her games. This year my girlfriend made plans and I decided to spend time with my girlfriend on my birthday. We ordered take out and watch Marvel movies. We drink wine and had some fun time. I was too wasted to drive and for the first time, I missed my little sister game. My mom sent me a long paragraph on how I ruined my little sister's day by missing her game. I told her that I wasn't sober enough to drive and for once I celebrated my birthday. We argue. But am I the asshole?

427,WIBTA if i let my family exclude my mother from our yearly lake trip?,148,Not the A-hole,20,hqobau,1594704781.0,"Here‚Äôs some backstory.

My mother (35F) is an addict. She used to leave me (17F) home alone for days on end with no texts back or phone calls to let me know she‚Äôs safe. When she WAS at home, it would either be with a new guy, or to take a day to sleep, shower and pack more clothes in her bag. It wasn‚Äôt always like this, but ever since her younger brother passed suddenly in December 2018 she‚Äôs gotten worse and worse.

Sometime in October 2019, my grandma, auntie A and auntie B all talked with each other and decided that me living with my mom would no longer be safe. They decided to ask me if I wanted to move in with auntie B. I agreed, and in less than two days I had moved out of my mom‚Äôs apartment and with auntie B across the city.

Here‚Äôs where the AITA part starts.

During our yearly lake trip, we rent cabins for a weekend for our entire family. This includes my grandparents, aunties and uncles, and all of my cousins. Some of our cousins from the other side of the family come too. It‚Äôs a big event that everyone looks forward to, and thankfully isn‚Äôt cancelled due COVID-19.

Since I moved in with auntie B, my mother no longer receives family insurance and got very angry with my aunties about it. Because of this, they decided it would be safer for our family and myself that they didn‚Äôt invite my mother to our yearly lake trip. They did tell me that if I still wanted her there, they‚Äôd try to talk it out with my mom so everybody can be civil for a weekend. So Reddit, WIBTA if I said I DON‚ÄôT want her there?

Edit: I want it to be known that I still love my mother, and I want to be her daughter again. I miss her so much and she misses me too. I know that if I exclude her she‚Äôll react badly, but what I dont know is if she‚Äôll take it out on me, our family or on herself and if it makes me TA for doing so.",False,1594705600.0,2020-07-13 22:33:01

So I (23 genderqueer) have always have a... turbulent relationship with my mother (48f) to say the least. Not that she was outright abusive, but she's definitely dancing on the fringes of Entitledom. To give you the scope, she is the type to believe that the cause of economic downfall is solely ""foreigners stealing our jobs"", something I was heavily against. She used to bully me a LOT for my views, even once called me a terrorist sympathiser for not thinking every Muslim person was bad and that hijabs weren't a big deal.

I may be bias in this description, but it's all I can do.

My relationship with her has semi-cooled in the last month or so, and I went around today to sort out through some old items. I was telling her about my post univeristy plans and maybe applying to study in this abroad program, which had an option to study in Poland, which I said I would not be doing.

Mom: Well, why not?

Me: Poland has some really strong anti-LGBT attitudes there. I wouldn't feel safe.

Mom: Ugh.

Me: What?

Mom: You can't paint every Polish person with the same brush.

Me: I'm not. Their /governmental policies/ make me feel unsafe. Besides, you're not exactly one to talk.

Mom: What do you mean?

Me: You and Stepdad literally have a history of hating Polish people.

Mom: No we don't! We have Polish friends.

Me: You literally both used to blame Polish people for stealing jobs. I remember you guys complaining listening to the news.

I (19 M) have been going to therapy for a few weeks now. My therapist told me today that I should schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist to get on a low grade anxiety medicine. My mom was upset because she doesn‚Äôt see medicine as a solution but rather a ‚Äúband-aid‚Äù. I pushed her on it and finally she relented saying ‚ÄúOnly if you can provide us with a clean drug test will I pay for medicine.‚Äù The ‚Äúdrug‚Äù I‚Äôve been using is just weed.

One cousin, Megan (31f), is a very mean and spiteful person, always has been. It wasn't until a few years ago that I began to fully understand just how awful of a person she is.

A couple months ago, we got in an argument that Megan started and based on some cruel things she said, it basically terminated any chance of ever rebuilding a relationship with her again. Not a big deal to me as she isn't someone I'd like to spend time with. She made a point to tell me that this is the ""last I'll ever hear from her"" as she's ""done talking to me for good."" This is also not the first time she's said this to me/other people and always comes back around when she needs something from someone.

Yesterday I got a knock on my door around 3pm and it was Carrie (Megan's younger sister). Megan was waiting in the car. Carrie said that the two of us should ""talk things out"" because she's sick of hearing Megan talk about all this family drama. I told her it's not my problem if she's hanging onto old news and that I've moved on and don't want to invite her back into my life. Carrie insisted and told me how it'll ""mess up the family dynamic"" if we don't make up, since holidays/family gatherings/etc will all be awkward if there is this divide between us. I told her that Megan said some very unforgivable things and that I'm not willing to just forget about it like I always have before.

Carrie continued to insist and waved for Megan to get out of the car. I told them both to leave and that I'm not interested, so I shut the door. Carrie starts knocking again and so I told her that if I don't see their car start to drive out of my driveway in the next 30 seconds, I'll be calling the cops because I've already told them to leave. She said ""you wouldn't do that"" and so I grabbed my phone and started to dial.

Well they ended up leaving after that, but today I've had to listen to what an asshole move it was to threaten to ""call the cops on my own family"" for not leaving my property. Some of my family thinks I'm an asshole for that, because apparently ""Megan was trying to make amends."" My friends, however, think that I was totally in the right.

She gave the fakest interview about it, saying how hard it has been for her to take the video down from porn sites and how much abuse and harassment she has faced over it. It was extremely obvious she was faking and trying to leverage this situation into more fame and Instagram followers.

We were discussing this with my friends and pretty much everyone agreed, but there was this one girl, Lena, who got extremely offended over my stance and said that what happened to her was horrible and she's a victim in this whole situation.

I told her she was being naive if she believed that woman's crocodile tears and that she's as much of a victim of revenge porn as Kim Kardashian or Paris Hilton.

She started calling me an asshole and said that even if that was the case, I still shouldn't be speaking out against her because her message (don't upload stuff without consent) is still valuable and needs to be heard.

I obviously agreed with her that the message was correct, but I told her that it was still important to point out this was most likely a publicity stunt by someone who was after Instagram followers and views.

She automatically assumed I would help her with legal documents (drafting, review), but no big deal. I was happy to do it even though I already have a full time job that takes up a lot of my time and it required some extra research on my part. 

Because this was not my regular job, sometimes I had to put work for her on the back burner. Any reasonable person should be able to understand this, I think, but not my wife. She felt entitled to be 1st priority even though I explained to her that I had to prioritize the job that was actually paying our bills, which only upset her more. 

We had several argument about this, and during one of them she accused me of being lazy. She said that my job is easy and anyone could do it. I just didn't want to help her because I didn't believe in her, never mind that I'd been spending my free nights and weekends doing work for her. That upset me so I told her I was done. If she wanted someone to review her legal documents then she should find a local firm and hire them. That upset her too because her margins were already thin, so the extra expense didn't help. And she didn't mind letting me know how she felt about that decision. 

A friend of mine was recently looking for someone to do some interior design work for him. He had already talked to my wife, but I told him that if I was in his position I would use someone more established and who wasn't a wreck 24/7 (basically told him about our fights and that based on how she'd treated me lately I questioned her mental fitness to do a project like his). He was surprised by that but decided to take my advice and go with someone else.

When my wife asked me to help her talk to him, I told her no because I'd already told him not to use her. This became another big fight, and we are still fighting about it. 

She told me that this could have been a big step forward for her business and because of what I did it may mean she doesn't make it. I don't know if that is true or not, but I stand by my advice to him. She is an emotional wreck and in no frame of mind to help anyone.

For a little bit of background, my parents (specifically my mother) have always had me on a ‚Äúvery tight leash‚Äù (said by other family members), an example of this is that one of my earliest memories is crying as at the dining room table for 4 hours memorizing my spelling words in pre-k . In the past my mother has said she treated me that way because she thought she would only have one child so she ‚Äúwanted it to be perfect‚Äù. This makes me feel kinda weird but it makes my younger sister feel like she was unwanted. 

Anyways, to get back on topic I‚Äôve been trying to be more independent by filling out my own applications for college, emailing my teachers regarding their plans for the upcoming school year etc. When i told my mother this she felt that i was getting an attitude, and that i was making her into a villain and that im disregarding everything shes done for me. Every time we talk now she feels like i have an attitude with her, and i admit i am guilty of being disrespectful in the past, but i have always apologized and in our recent conversations I have been trying extremely hard to not hold any attitude in my tone/body language. 

I tried to have a conversation with her by saying things like, ‚Äú i love you but im almost ready to leave home for college and I need to be able to perform some of these things on my own‚Äù. i told her that I was sorry she was perceiving my actions as disrespectful, but they weren‚Äôt intended that way and she freaked out and said that she was the parent and the only thing that mattered was her perception because she was the adult.

So, myself (33F) and my husband (36M) got married 7 years ago. The day was beautiful and we had a really great time. In the lead up to the wedding my brother in law convinced me to hire his friend as a photographer and he would give me a good deal. I gave the photographer some pictures with the sort of photos I was wanting &amp; what I would really love, he agreed to do so &amp; I paid him. Well, I did, I did most of the planning so I see this as my fault. 

The day went well. The photographer and his wife turned up on time and were helpful during the getting ready stages. The photographer looked like he was in pain all the time &amp; he eventually told me he had hayfever and a sinus headache. Which I completely understand and I deal with it often, it can be debilitating at times. So most of the morning and ceremony he got his wife to take photos while he rested (his wife isn‚Äôt a photographer). 

Anyway, after about a month I got a USB with all my photos. I absolutely hated them. None were anything like what I was wanting &amp; 99% of the photos were just like headshots &amp; from the waist up. I got no full length photos of my dress, no photos of the reception at all either. None of the photos were edited either. We had them there &amp; supplied them all their drinks and meals. I can‚Äôt even look at them without feeling a little hurt. I didn‚Äôt tell the photographer that I hated them, didn‚Äôt ask for any refunds or anything. 

Now, I know this is ‚Äúfirst world problems‚Äù but I mainly want to know if what I‚Äôm planning is justified. 

I am thinking that on our 10 year anniversary that we do a little redo. Not a wedding redo, but a photography redo. I get a nice dress, my husband dresses up, my kids wear little suits. I hire a great photographer, spend the money and just get some beautiful photos. I know it won‚Äôt replace the day, but it‚Äôs just something I want. I want beautiful photos, of me and my husband dressed up. 

I told my brother in law about this and he called me an asshole. Said that I am being an asshole to his friend for redoing all his hard work &amp; an asshole to him because he‚Äôs the one who suggested him. I don‚Äôt feel like I am, but my husband is sort of on the fence between me and his brother so I‚Äôm not sure on if I‚Äôm overreacting or being an asshole. 

So, reddit, AITA?

EDIT TO ADD - since it was brought up, I didn‚Äôt realise that my heading was so deceiving. And apparently I‚Äôm slight TA for talking about my wedding photos. 
But, it‚Äôs not me saying I‚Äôm redoing my wedding photos, it‚Äôs my brother in law. He‚Äôs saying dressing up and getting an anniversary shoot is like redoing my wedding photos. So I assumed that from the amount of shit I was getting from him, that I was actually trying to redo them. 
Sorry.

Me- hey! So I was considering at our 10 year anniversary that we do a little photo shoot at the beach! You were the best man so I would love you to be there!

My friend was great, but they lied about a lot of things. Some of them were utter BS (I have superpowers, I‚Äôm a vampire, I‚Äôm dating Tom Holland, Tom Holland is my biological brother but I was put up for adoption), but some of them were just stupid in general.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been taking piano lessons‚Äù but cannot play a scale correctly/ play with more than one hand/can only play Turkish March, nothing else.

Recently, our entire friend group was hanging out at my house (4 people in total), and they said they had autism because they were very sensitive to loud noises. I also am sensitive to loud noises. They don‚Äôt show any signs of autism AT ALL, so I just kind of passed it off as another lie and moved on. (Note: My brother and sister both have Aspergers, and they still show some more mild signs. I understand autism affects everyone differently, but they showed literally no signs)  

Not even two minutes later, they pulled out their phone and started blasting this incredibly loud video (Think earr*pe on max volume) and they were still able to hold a conversation while it was right next to their ear. I became VERY uncomfortable, and asked them to turn it down. They laughed and turned the volume up. I didn‚Äôt want to cause a confrontation, so I walked away, into my bedroom. 

A while later, the other two walked up to apologize for the loud noises, but the ‚Äúautistic‚Äù friend said they thought I was just faking it for attention and I was trying to act autistic when I‚Äôm not. 

I‚Äôm not autistic, but I don‚Äôt like loud noises. I wasn‚Äôt acting autistic, I was acting in a non-confrontational manner by removing myself from the situation until I could calm down. 

I freaked out on them, and told them that I wasn‚Äôt claiming to have autism,  I am sensitive to loud noises.

They told me they were sorry, that they missed the social cue because of their autism. 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt. Have. Autism.‚Äù

They ran off crying, and said I was a major AH to call them a liar in front of our friends.

As of now - I have a cat and he has NEVER had a pet. I talk about getting a new pet when I‚Äôm doing my PhD or having a career - but for right now, my cat is good 


So my birthday is a few days away and my boyfriend has been excited to tell me about a special surprise gift that he has for me 

Personally, I told him I would prefer a surprise and what not so I never pried 

Well, he just let me know he has been talking to some guy on Facebook marketplace or something and got my a hamster - all excited because he had to pick it up earlier 

I thought he was joking at first - but when he kept insisting he wasn‚Äôt, I told him I had to refuse the gift 

I explained how - a) it could NOT be in my room with my cat and I never discussed it with my roommates and b) I don‚Äôt like pet hamsters, I‚Äôve had them before and they aren‚Äôt my cup of tea 

He told me that he had been planning this for months and he was super excited for it and was upset I wasn‚Äôt excited too 

I apologized but tried to explain that hamsters - especially ones you get older - are not always the cute little things you see on Instagram stories. Plus, it‚Äôs feels like I‚Äôm literally dangling an appetizer out there for my pet cat 

He explained that if I didn‚Äôt want The hamster, I would get nothing and he would have to go through the embarrassment of telling a stranger he‚Äôs been conversing with he changed his mind 

I told him that was totally fine with me and he was pretty passive aggressive - especially in front of friends explaining he had the ‚Äúperfect gift‚Äù but I was ungrateful 


I eventually snapped and told him that ‚Äúextra responsibility without my approval is not a gift‚Äù 

He‚Äôs pissed - I never heard him explaining any desire to have a hamster (nor have I ever) so I‚Äôm super confused about the whole thing.

My (30M) mother in law just moved into a new apartment, we came to help her move. After we were done I went to take a nap, I do a biphasic sleep schedule. In the meantime they went over to my partner's sister's to see her. All great so far.

Next my MIL's friend drops off the most adorable six week old kitten. We spent about an hour together, him trying to get acquainted with the new environment and myself just in awe. He trusted me very quickly and would meow at me to follow him so he feels safe exploring.

My partner and her mom come back home and bring her sister (31F) and her two kids (3 & 7). Instantly the kitten is terrified and the kids are all over him -- completely understandable, he's too cute. I asked them to be gentle please because he's little and went to get some food for the kitten.

I was a bit worried because these kids are very far from disciplined and I've had to stop them from being too rough with my adult cats before. Anyways I come back, put the food down, and walk to the bedroom where the kids and the kitten are.

I see the younger one shoving the kitten forcefully into one of those Kitty huts -- the kitten was terrified trying to get out, meowing desperately. The kid shoves him back in and forcefully tries to close the hole so it can't get out. My instant reaction was ""Hey! Don't do that to the kitten, he doesn't want to be in there."" At this point only the ""hey"" was stern.

He smiled at me and ignored me, doing it again. So at this point I sternly told him ""I said stop. You're scaring and hurting the kitten."" He finally stopped and told me ""I wanted him to go in the house.""

His mom comes out of the bathroom already pissed saying ""you didn't have to give him that ATTITUDE.""

Now this is where I dropped the ball hardcore... Maybe it was having recently woken up, maybe it was being protective of the kitten, and maybe it was the previous history of the parents and how undisciplined I find these kids.

Anyways without thinking I answered in a snarky tone ""well fuck... Who's going to then?""

She went livid from 0 to 60 ""ex-fucking-cuse me? You don't talk to a child like that over a KITTEN.""

Not gonna lie this made me livid also because I can't stand when people use ""it's just an animal"" to excuse humans (adult or children) from treating them horribly.

I just said ""go fuck yourself"", albeit louder than I should have around kids, and walked out. 

So now in my partner's sister's eyes I'm the most horrid human being alive for being ""rude"" to the kid.

Once a year, my parents host a big party to celebrate New Years. They always invite this family who is full of entitled kids. One of the entitled kids (EK, 8M) found a nerf gun.

EK takes the nerf gun and walks up to me (16M). I was playing Smash Ultimate with my friends at the time, so I didn‚Äôt notice when EK points the gun at my face. He says, ‚ÄúAvengers assemble!‚Äù, and shoots it at my face. It stung, and I got salty, but I couldn‚Äôt afford to lose the close match with my friend, so I just threw the bullet away.

The EK found the bullet and put it back in the nerf gun, and he walked up to me again. After saying ‚ÄúAvengers assemble!‚Äù, the little bastard shoots the cup of soda next to me, spilling it all over my shirt. I was even more salty, but I couldn‚Äôt do anything with the amount of adults in the living room, so I just walked to my room and changed my shirt.

However, I forgot to hide the bullet, so when I sat down to play with my friend again, the EK walks up to me again, preparing to shoot me. Just like before, he said, ‚ÄúAvengers assemble!‚Äù But right after he finished saying that, I twisted the nerf gun around at shot it at his forehead. He immediately starts crying, attracting the attention of all of the adults in the living room.

Everyone at the party called me an ‚Äúasshole‚Äù for not ‚Äúplaying with the little kid‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt cave into pressure and refused to apologize.

As she was from another country we ended up getting married so that it would be easier for her to live and work her, we've been married now for 6 years and everything was great.

Lockdown was hard for my wife as she couldn't find much to keep herself entertained. She started playing a MMO again and this has affected her sleep schedule as she mostly plays with Americans and is awake until 3/4am. She's been furloughed and I'm still working so I've taken over the office whilst she's set up in the living room as I need more space for my work.

I've grown out of gaming so I mostly keep myself entertained with exercise, reading, gardening and a bit of DIY in my shed. I've tried to include my wife in things but all she wants to do is play her MMO. She'll usually wake up at 12/1pm and after eating and showering she'll be sat in her den until the early hours of the morning. It was a struggle to ever get her to exercise a bit as she'd be sat down for at least 12 hours. The most contact we'll have is if I sit in the living room and watch TV, even then I have to wear headphones or I'm disturbing her. 

My issue however has arisen over how close she is getting with some of the people she plays with. She's always talking to people, but I also noticed she'd always texting someone as well. I had a little stalk of her Reddit account and it turns out the MMO she plays has a marriage system in it and she got married to a guy she's been playing with. I confronted her about this which led to an argument about how close she is with this one guy she plays with. She showed me the texts and he's always flirting or trying to get her to send pictures.

I asked her if he knew she was married and she said no, her excuse being ""he wouldn't help me in the game if he knew"". I had enough of this and the fact that all she does is play this game for 12 hours a day and told her to quit the MMO.

Now she's not talking to me because I'm a ""controlling asshole"".",False,False,2020-07-09 21:42:26

A few weeks later I found out I was pregnant. At first I was still hurt by his words and actions and I didn't want him to think that I'm using the baby as a way to get him back so I decided to wait for the first trimester to be over before telling him.  But when I tried contacting him I realised I had been blocked everywhere. I didn't know his new address but from my mum I found out where he worked now. So last week I decided to drop in because I'll be moving away before the baby arrives and he should probably know he'll have a son soon.

So I showed up and told him and he was less than thrilled. He said I should have told him earlier when something could have been done about it still and he wasn't happy I showed up at his work. ( I didn't go in, I waited at his car).

He is very displeased with the whole situation. I'm not sure if I'm TA because he did tell me to never contact him again and when I tried it didn't work. And running after him just wasn't my first priority especially because I knew I'd keep the baby no matter what.",False,False,2020-07-11 11:36:41

So lately my roommate, let's call her Elizabeth, has been shitting in my bathtub at least twice a week. The first time it happened I assumed there was a break-in because I couldn't imagine she'd do something like that. Then I started to notice it only happened during times she was home alone. She refuses to acknowledge that it's even occurring to the degree that it's bordering on gaslighting. Meanwhile, she continues to repeatedly complain about how I got the bedroom with the bathtub, despite claiming she wanted the other bedroom as it is larger but has a bathroom with a shower only. I feel like I'm going insane!

The situation came to a head last Friday when Elizabeth told me that I need to see someone about my schizophrenia as clearly no one is shitting in the bathtub. Later that day, she then complained about the smell coming from my room after she had clearly shit in the bathtub again. That is when I blew up and starting throwing her things out off of the balcony (we live on the second floor) and told her she needed to move out immediately and that I would cover the rent going forwards I just can't live this way anymore.

Currently, she is posting daily to her Facebook about the struggles of being homeless in a major city. I wonder if I should feel bad, but I just can't. AITA for kicking her out?

My wife has had some conflict with my family, and in the past I've always taken her side. My parents are both Persian and they were not happy when I married outside the race, but they have not said anything directly offensive. I guess this all happened two years ago but it is just coming to light.

So my parents had an arranged marriage, but most people are surprised to learn that because they did fall genuinely in love. I guess when I was engaged my mom told my wife about her arranged marriage. My wife asked my mom some questions about how it worked and my mom convinced my wife that her father sold her to my father for $300. This objectively makes no sense because my grandfather is pretty well off, so why $300? She gave her a fake story about how my dad would come over and inspect her and her sisters like horses. My wife didn't say anything because she thought it was a secret, but I guess she felt bad for my mom.

Now my sister recently got engaged. The man is Persian but it was not an arranged married. My mom said to my wife, I guess the prices went up because she sold for $5,000. Again this objectively doesn't make much sense because my dad owns a successful business and $5,000 isn't a big deal to him. My wife got very upset and told my dad that he is a pig (he was in on it) and told my sister we would help her get away. My mom admitted it was a joke and now my wife feels like an idiot.

I think it was a bitchy thing to do, but I can't believe that my wife fell for it. She wants me to go to war with my family, but I think it just needs to die a natural death. I did tell her i was surprised that she was so gullible, and now she is upset with me.",False,False,2020-07-13 16:14:32

After years of living together, I‚Äôve decided to move out and live on my own. Stacy and Nicole have also decided to end their leases, so we all decided a day to clean the apartment together. Because of the pandemic, Stacy and i have been living in our hometowns (mine is 2 hours away, stacy‚Äôs is about 45 minutes away, and Nicole lives in town, but with her boyfriend), so we decided a month in advance that we were going to deep clean the apartment/kitchen area all together. Nicole picked the weekend that worked best for her. We also agreed for everyone to take their items out of the cupboards and move out, so that the day could be about cleaning and not about moving their items. 

Nicole called me about a week before we were supposed to clean to tell me that she grabbed everything that was hers, and the rest of it was Stacy‚Äôs.

448,WIBTA to only invite one twin to a party?,131,Not the A-hole,52,hould0,1594435455.0,"This happened before lockdown but it was on my mind today because we went to school to pick up books before the holidays and I saw the mum at the school gates. 

For my daughters 6th birthday party she wanted a climbing party. She climbs every week at our local gym and she wanted to share her hobby with her friends. The climbing gym has pretty firm rules for parties with strict ratios between the instructors and the kids so there are limits on how many kids you can have. In total we had 20 kids with 4 instructors (1 instructor to 5 kids). We had then hired out a conference room to have party food and games after the climbing.

My daughter goes to a big school with a few classes in each year group. And she had invited probably about 1/3 of her class plus friends from our neighbourhood and other clubs she goes to. We received 19 confirmations plus my daughter making 20 kids in total which meant we only needed to hire 4 instructors. This was all sorted out weeks before the party and I thought everything was all sorted until I received a text message from a kids mum at 11pm, 2 days before the party. Her kid, K1 was invited to the party and they had sent their RSVP weeks ago. 

Mum: ‚ÄúHi, K1 is attending the party, can you let me know if his brother (K2) can attend, he is the same age‚Äù

Now, I didn‚Äôt know that K1 had a twin because my daughter had never mentioned him and he was in a different class. The school let you split twins up if parents choose, to encourage independence. 

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry but we‚Äôve already confirmed the numbers with the gym and it‚Äôs too late to change, we have hired the exact number of instructors for the number of kids attending. If someone is sick on the day I can let you know and K2 could take their place?‚Äù

Mum: ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôve thought about it and I would like to pay for the extra instructor. Please could you tell me how to arrange this with them.‚Äù 

I was pretty taken aback by this, you can‚Äôt just invite yourself to someone‚Äôs party and I had already filled and named all of the party bags - I had bought little carabiners so it wasn‚Äôt as simple as making up an extra bag as I didn‚Äôt have extras.

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but I think it‚Äôs just too late notice on this occasion. If another child is sick on the day then I will text you and K2 can attend, but otherwise I don‚Äôt see how it is possible‚Äù 

In the end another kid WAS sick on the day and I let her know and both her boys came. A few people have said that I should have invited both twins but in my mind if you choose to split them into different classes you should expect them to have different friends and go to different parties...

The thing is, when I texted my friend Kate (not her real name) and asked her what she wanted for her birthday which is in a little over a month, she said that she wanted a sweater like the one that I had just knitted. 

I like Kate and consider her ‚Äúsweater worthy‚Äù so I didn‚Äôt have a problem with it, but the thing is that sweaters are pretty expensive and also, in my sweater, I had indulged in really fancy and expensive yarn (mohair). 

I told Kate that I would be happy to make her the sweater, but that she would have to pay for the materials. I also sent her a list of her choices between yarn depending on how much she wanted to spend. 

Kate got really mad over this and said that the entire point of gifts is that you purchase it for the person. That makes sense, but I would consider the gift all of the time and effort that I would put into her sweater especially since I‚Äôm pretty slow knitter so if would be a lot of work to have it finished by her birthday. 

I explained that to Kate that if she wanted something smaller, I‚Äôd pay for it, but that the sweater is out of what I‚Äôm comfortable paying if since she isn‚Äôt willing to have it in acrylic. That made her really upset. 

I‚Äôm conflicted because on one hand, if I use significantly cheaper yarn, I could pay for it and it would still be basically within a reasonable amount to spend on a birthday present.

He has called out younger brother a 'r#tard' because of his autism, and mocked him when he thought nobody was looking. I ignored the slurs against me but I did get very angry about the R-word comment and I did attack him over that. I take responsibility for attacking him over it, but I do not regret it.

She said that I was being dramatic and that he'd been joking, but I wasn't having it and told her that I wasn't going to the wedding unless he swore not to say those things, and that our brother (who relies on me a lot) wasn't going if he was just going to be demeaned. 

My sister said that I hadn't made any attempts to get to know him, which isn't true, and that it was only a joke, but I said that was a bad joke to make and also that I wasn't going to entertain him because he was a 'd#ck'.

Dropped a couple of f-bombs saying that it was a disgrace that they couldn't even be bothered to write a card or do something nice like breakfast in bed etc.  Told them that our disappointment comes from a place of love and high expectations, that they are dear to us but that they need to show more gratitude to their mum (who bends over backwards for them), especially on a milestone birthday and especially after having such a shit year.

I joked about how if I knew that guys had such a ginger fetish, I wouldn't be so happy that I don't look so ginger anymore.

Seeing all the positive attention on her, I decided to dye my hair ginger again, and I actually like it. But over one incident I'm wondering if I'm an asshole:

I was out with my friend a few days ago (lockdown has been lifted here) and a guy approached her telling her he liked her hair and asked her if it was a natural color. She smiled and was about to reply, and I said ""no it's not, but I am a natural ginger"". He said nice, talked to her a little and then left.

My friend got kinda pissed off that I replied instead of her, and I told her that it's not fair to lie to guys like that, especially since some of us have been bullied for being born like that. She said she never lies about her hair and tells everyone who asks that it's dyed. I genuinely didn't know this.

I guess she's not that mad anymore, tho I still feel that she kinda distanced herself from me. I don't think I'm the AH as I genuinely didn't know, and also it's not fair that me being born ginger resulted in me being bullied and hating my hair/freckles, and she gets all the positive attention and it's not even her real hair.

I was pretty furious since she had forbidden to go my therapist for almost half a year and continued to call me an attention seeker whenever I braught it up .

456,WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt return furniture I got for free 12 years ago?,121,Not the A-hole,50,hqsdle,1594719384.0,"12 or so years ago I was away at college and came home on a break to find new bedroom furniture in my room- two dressers, one with a massive mirror attached, and a nightstand. My mom said my aunt gave them to me because she was getting new furniture, and for clarity, this aunt is my moms sisters husbands sister, so not technically an aunt or relative. 


When I moved out to my own condo about 5 years after that, I took this furniture with me. I love it, it‚Äôs a very modern style, all white with black knobs. I designed my bedroom around it by going with a black and white houndstooth theme. 


Last week I received a text that my aunt wants the furniture back. She said this furniture has sentimental value, as it was her grandmothers and as other relatives have passed she wants to hold onto what she can by ‚Äúkeeping it in the family‚Äù. This was new information and I can understand her points but, this furniture was clearly newish, probably less then 10 years old when I got it. Its not antique or something that‚Äôs been in the family for generations. 


Where I could be the asshole- after 12 years, this definitely feels like my bedroom set. I enjoy the look of it and don‚Äôt want to look for a replacement. It would also be very expensive to unexpectedly replace my bedroom set. I understand it was hers and she gave it to me for free, but do I owe it to her to return it because of sentimental value when I love it too and it has sentimental value to me?",False,False,2020-07-14 02:36:24

I'm an 15 year old autistic girl I've recently had my P.I.P results and my jealous older sister wants me to use my money to buy her a new phone

( To those who don't know what a P.I.P is. It's means¬†Personal Independence Payment¬†(PIP) is extra money to help you with everyday life if you've an illness,¬†disability¬†or mental health condition. You can get it on top of Employment and Support Allowance or other benefits.) 

From my p.i.p I get around ¬£600 to ¬£700 ( from what my mother has told me) 

So let's get to the story
Since I was diagnose with autism my older sister ( let's call her Katy) has been really jealous of me, yeah she's since to me ( most of the time) she always got what she wants from makeup to brand new laptops etc. She would break her arms get herself ill just for attention, she has brought me a few things which seems strange to me when tho she hates me.

So when I told her that I was accepted with me p.i.p she suddenly started being really nice to me ( and I mean REALLY nice ) and started buying things like Dragon ball z merchandise, new clothes ect. Which I do use some of the money I earn to buy her things back since I love my big sister

Then she send me a message on discord asking me to buy her a new phone since ""I brought you so much, so you owe me it"" so I told her ""sorry Katy mum says that the money is to help me with my future so I can't use it on others it's for me""  then Katy response ""Why do you get all of this money but I don't it's not fair"" then I respond back ""what happened to all the other phones that your dad got you?"" She types back ""those other phones are so useless my dad can't even get me decent phone"" so I replied ""I'm sorry Katy but I'm not going to use my p.i.p money to buy you a phone"" 

Then she said something that really broken my heart ""oi you little shit, I am the one who got you all of those  Dragon ball DvDs and shit, you are going to buy me the phone as a re-payment, I deserve that money not you, you only have autism it's not that much of a big deal"" 

I couldn't take it anymore so I blocked her on discord and banned her from my server, she has compiled to my step-brother (Jonathan) that I am a asshole for not getting her the phone

There's a zoo nearby so we spent the day there while we were close by and had a wonderful day. When we was going through the giftshop I spotted a cuddly toy that I instantly fell in love with. It was on a display for collectable bears and they were pretty expensive. I'm a bit of minimalist (I don't like to have items that clutter or have no real purpose in my home) but I just found it to be the cutest thing I've ever seen, it cost just shy of ¬£100 but my fiance insisted that he'd buy me it as an ""engagement gift"".

His name is Cyril and I love him - the bear that is. Its got long fluffy fur in a blueish grey and black pattern. I never thought as an adult I'd become so attached to a cuddly toy, but I've slept with this thing every night since. Even on trips away, Cyril comes with. It's a very well made bear and has a lot of weight to it, so it almost feels like I'm cuddling a small dog or something. It reminds me of my fiance when he's not around and brings me a lot of comfort. 

As it turns out, these bears are very collectable. Someone in my one of my group chats mentioned that she collects these specific bears and i excitedly told her that I have one of those bears and it means so much to me. She asked for a picture and she freaked out at me. 

She asked me what the hell I'd been doing to it, and I told her that I sleep with it every night. She told me it's worthless now and I'm stupid for ruining something that could be worth even more money one day. She said I should've just gotten a cheap bear to cuddle and these things aren't toys. She genuinely seemed offended. 

Cyril has definitely seen better days now his furs all tatty and he's a bit cuddled out of shape, but he's been very well loved and is absolutely priceless to me. I still feel kinda bad after being solded for ""ruining"" him. AITA?

However, the last few years have been especially bad. I am generally a private person so very few people in my life know what has been going on. My best friend, Rachel, (19F) is the only person I have talked openly to about this.

About 18months ago I went off the rails. I would drink excessively at social events and was a huge asshole to a lot of people, especially Rachel. The thing that scared me into getting help was when I ran away from a party that Rachel was meant to pick me up from because I started hearing voices and shit. Rachel spent 2 hours looking for me and it changed our relationship.

The next week I made an appointment with a counsellor and I now have regular appointments and am on medication. I was completely sober for the next 3 months but after talking to my psychologist I decided to drink again as I believe that it was the shit going on in my life that was the problem, not the alcohol. I have gotten my drinking and mental health under control and have gone out drinking multiple times with no issues. However, Rachel constantly says that I am an embarrassment to her and she can't trust me when I'm drinking. I have apologised to her multiple times about how shitty I was to her but I have also explained that a lot of it was due to my poor mental health at the time. However, she still continues to make comments about me being an alcoholic and brings up my past actions which I have explained is hurtful and makes it harder for me to move on. I have asked multiple people in my life if they feel the same way and no-one agrees with her. I don't think that mental health is an excuse but I do think that it can help to explain a situation and that if someone is actively trying to better themselves it should be taken into account.

She and one of my other best friends (Lucy) are having a joint party for their birthdays which I was very excited for. It is expected that everyone will be drinking and they are providing alcohol. However, she privately messaged me saying that if I drink I will be asked to leave as she doesn't want me ruining her day. I understand that it's her house and her rules and I wasn't even planning on drinking as I'm working the next day, but being held to a different set of rules over something that happened over 6 months ago, that I have taken multiple steps to address, have apologised for multiple times, and haven't even come close to repeating for 6 months has really hurt me and made me not want to go at all.

I don‚Äôt dislike Dan, but I know he‚Äôs a slob.

471,AITA for wanting to go to a bar with my gf and her work friend?,105,No A-holes here,81,hot4bs,1594430812.0,"So me (24) and my gf (22), Megan (pseudonym), have ben going out for nearly 2 years now. We're pretty serious and committed to each other so there's no questioning either of out loyalty to each other. Lately, there's this guy from her work, we'll call him Dave (23), she's been hanging out with particularly at a local bar in their town. They enjoy each other's company as friends and I'm okay with it myself. I met Dave, he's a pretty decent dude, we got along pretty well.

Recently however, Megan came to my house and met up with me just after work. She'd been aware Dave wanted to call and tell her something after he got off work himself. Lo and behold, shortly after I came home Dave called Megan and I was there, silent, for the whole conversation. Megan had her suspicions beforehand, which she made me aware of, and she turned out to be right. Dave had feelings for her and wanted to confess, asking her to keep it between the two of them. Megan let him down as best she could and affirmed her commitment to me. I have no doubt my presence didn't make a difference to her response; I trust her completely. They're still friends and, though he isn't aware that I know, I'm still cool with Dave as long as he doesn't overstep his boundaries.

Cut to present, Megan has next Tuesday off and told Dave they could have a few drinks at the bar Monday night. I myself have some time and would like to join them which wasn't normally a problem before. She's asked me now if I wouldn't be upset if she asked me not to come. Her reason being she doesn't want to make Dave feel uncomfortable after his little confession. Ultimately, I don't mind her and Dave having a few drinks together without as I'm not worried about then doing much else. I personally feel scorned though, just wanting to have a couple beers with my girlfriend and Dave cause the more the merrier but honestly if he's uncomfortable with me being there and is still under the impression that I don‚Äôt know about his feelings for Megan that's his problem and it shouldn't get in my of spending time with Megan, though I do respect him hope he finds someone else to be with him. Naturally this seems to possibly be spawning an argument that perhaps no one will be happy with the outcome of though I do hope it doesn't come to that. Am I the asshole though?

Edit: I'm aware of the possibility but don't jump straight to the conclusion that she's cheating on me. You don't know us and you don't know our relationship. When I say I trust her that doesn't merely come from me needing to believe she wouldn't do such a thing. It's not her I'm worried about.",False,1594406259.0,2020-07-10 18:26:52

My mom got really mad and started insulting me and accusing me of being of not being an actual woman and being a man because only men hate makeup (idk she has always had this mindset). These comments upset me for many reasons and we started to fight. 

When the actual party happened, I was in a very bad mood and my mother got very angry again because I was in a bad mood and that she has worked very hard for the birthday party and that she has been working a lot and spent a lot of money for the party. She stated that I only exist to screw up her life. We started fighting in front everyone which basically ruined the party.

I get tested regularly. 

I also have been balancing online college courses at the same time. 

My boyfriend worked a couple times a week before the pandemic and was laid off a few months ago. He makes a good amount of unemployment benefits right now. More than what he made while working.

I wake up everyday for work before 8 am and come come around 6-7 every day. I am tired. 

My boyfriend cleans when I ask him to, does chores, and has helped ‚Äúbuy groceries‚Äù because he has state benefits. That‚Äôs in quotes because it‚Äôs not really coming out of his pocket.

My boyfriend always sleeps past noon. This irritates me even though he does chores.

My (20f) mother (48) is an absent mother. She's there but she wasn't  *there*. When I turned 18 I moved out while her and my step father (in his 50s) were at work due to the abuse I got at home from the step. For 2 years I've been trying to have some sort of relationship with her but it always seemed to fail. 

Eventually she texted me saying ""I love you but I don't want drama in my life anymore"". That shattered my heart. A few months later my sister calls me up bawling that our grandmother was put in the hospital. For two weeks I went and visited her and always seemingly missed my mother being there. Sometime in the two weeks my grandmother passed and that was another very hard blow to the heart. 

Her funeral comes around and I'm getting all the details from my sister who is getting them from our other sister who got them from our mother. At some point in time our mother wants to make amends and connect with all of us again. We all happily agreed. Well that never happened. That was last year. Later in the year I got married and also got pregnant. I told my mother this in hopes of...something I guess and all she said was ""okay"" and then suddenly I just stopped caring. 

My older sister is trying to get me to talk to our mother because ""she realizes its a mistake and wants apart of *her grandsons* life"". Well I never told her the gender. I only told close family and friends and told them she is NOT to know anything or see any ultrasounds. She made her bed. Apparently my older sister decided to not listen to me. Ever since our mother has been trying to reach me and all it's doing is stressing me out.

I have talked to my older sister as she has broken my trust and stated that she did. She thinks I'm an asshole for keeping our mothers grandchild away from her but she wanted nothing to do with me when I first told her I was pregnant so why does she suddenly get to be apart of it now?

Now I'm starting to think I might be the asshole because I really miss my mother and having a mother but my heart is telling me I can't go through it again when she decides her husband is more important yet again..

So tell me..am I the asshole or are my emotions getting the better of me?

My sister and her boyfriend (now fianc√©) moved into the other side of the duplex last year cause she was pregnant and needed a bigger place. Her son was born in January. (For reference, the duplex is two bed one bath on each side).

I work remotely for a company (even before ‚Äòrona) but they want to start moving their remote employees to in-office over the next two years. My gf is in nursing school, so once she‚Äôs done we‚Äôre gonna move to my new job location a couple states over, probably the tail end of the two years.

My sister has a tendency to... not think things through. She has told our mom, who told me, she wants to get pregnant again by next year so her kids don‚Äôt have a huge age gap like us and our older sister (8 years between her and me). This is a terrible idea for a lot of reasons, mostly cause pandemic, her boyfriend was laid off a few months ago, and she effectively ghosted her job after her son was born and maternity leave ended. They have almost no income aside from unemployment right now. She thinks it‚Äôll all work itself out and is not concerned.

She asked me when my gf and I were gonna move out, and if it was gonna be within the next year. I said no, probably not. She said she was talking to mom about renovating the duplex into a single-family so they can have more room for the kids. She then asked if it would be possible for me and my gf to move to another place until we leave the state so the Reno could start soon.

Told her hell no, the duplex is cheap and way nicer than we could normally afford on my salary plus my gf‚Äôs part time CNA money. We‚Äôll be staying at the duplex until we move out of state.

My sister was trying to compromise (mostly in her favor) and I kept denying her. She asked that I do her this one favor so she can give her kids a lot of space to grow. I said she has one kid right now, who is a baby, and she can wait two years. She insists she wants another baby soon and we‚Äôre not using all the space in our unit anyways.

Today I woke up and decided to take it upon myself to look up diy cleaning solutions. The jewelry I chose to clean weren't real gold or diamonds or even expensive so I figured it was safe.

Well I had everything but a toothbrush so I decided to go and ask my cousin (who I live with) if she has one.

Me: ""hey B, you got a toothbrush?""

B: ""Sure.""

Then she gave me one and made some joke about how only old ladies have spare toothbrush but she wanted to always be prepared in case someone needed. By this point she already gave me the brush and so I went to clean the jewelry.

Fast Forward and I asked her opinion like 2 times on if the jewelry looked differently to her.

Story: My boyfriend (26M British) and I started dating in December 2019. In March, we moved in together just before lockdown and are doing great. We are of the mindset of ‚Äúif we survived quarantine, we can survive anything‚Äù and have talked about how we both want to get married and have set an approximate date for the wedding (August 2022). Since my family is all in Canada, and we want to get married in England, I want to tell my family and friends that I‚Äôm inviting as soon as possible for them to save money and arrange. This is true for my friends who have just graduated from uni, and for my family members who have kids. It is really important to me that my uncle, his wife and 2 kids attend, as well as my godmother, her husband and their 2 kids. 
When I told my mom about our plans to get married, and how I wanted to tell close family and friends, she immediately said it would be tacky to invite people before we were actually engaged or we sent out the Save the Dates. 

Today, our landlord sent us an email today stating that they are selling the property and we need to be out of the house by the end of August. Obviously not ideal, but it gives us the opportunity to look for someplace closer to work and maybe a bit cheaper. When he got home from work, my boyfriend surprised me with a promise ring, which was great considering the rest of the news we got today. I am very excited and still can‚Äôt stop looking at it. He has promised to get engaged in the near future when we can afford a better ring, and to always make me happy. 
I FaceTimed my mom to share the news with her, and I asked if I could tell my family now because I really want to share this news with them, and give the people I really want there the best chance possible to attend. She immediately said no because we aren‚Äôt officially engaged. I asked her why. Would our close family think it was tacky? She said I was being rude and hung up on me. 

My boyfriend/future fianc√© said she was being unreasonable. As have the few other friends I have told. It almost seems like it would be easier to just let us do our own thing, and have my parents be guests at the wedding instead of asking them for advice and help while planning. 

Would I be the asshole for completely excluding my mom from all wedding plans, especially if she wouldn‚Äôt be contributing financially?

TL;DR: My over-controlling and un-approving mom doesn‚Äôt want me to tell important family members with children about my future wedding overseas because I‚Äôm not officially engaged.

Edit: wrong date! Changed wedding date from August 2020 to August 2022!

Edit 2: wow! Thanks everybody! This was very exciting to wake up to! I will go through all of your comments today and answer any questions. I really appreciate the kind words of support you‚Äôre all providing. I know I have a complicated relationship with my mother, and I have a constant need to please her. Maybe moving halfway across the world was my rebellion and I‚Äôm trying to break the cycle. This is just a reminder that I am my own person and I don‚Äôt need her approval for everything or anything!",False,1594708454.0,2020-07-13 21:20:01

After I got annoyed, I started saying I was busy and couldn't set it up for him, or that I was using the charging cable of the controllers, etc. Then, my mother started noticing and started asking why I wasn't letting him play (he would go out making a sad tone every time), and now she pressures me to stop being selfish to let him play, at least a bit.

I begged him to pull over because I did not feel safe. He refused. He insisted that he had control and that he was absolutely right. We did make it out safely but I strongly believe it was a risky dangerous move that put our entire family in danger. 

After we reached safety, I was so upset that I had a panic attack. I feel that he disregard my feelings and intuition. I feel he put my life at risk when I begged him not to. I don't feel like I can trust him with my life anymore. I feel like he disrespected me. He believes he did absolutely nothing wrong and refuses to apologize.

491,AITA for not hiding my mastectomy scars?,90,Not the A-hole,37,hq05se,1594610245.0,"Throwaway, mobile, sorry for formatting. English isn't my native language!

Backstory: I (26 FTM) had top surgery when I was 20, but my doc botched it up. I have fixed how my chest looks, but the scars are still an eyesore

My family was supportive all trough my transition, but DH (25 FTM) family is a mix of supportive and red neck hill billy degree of discriminating, the worst of them being SIL (34) and her crotch goblin Luci(fer) (~18F). Her other kid, Sam (13M) is an absolute angel.

But by GOD do I hate the SIL and Luci.

She disapproves of our ""lifestyle"" and marriage, but she keeps her mouth shut when ILs are around.

Last week we decided to have a family gathering. I originally didn't want SIL and Luci to come over. DH felt bad not inviting them. I wanted to be a good husband, so I agreed to have them over on the condition that if she fucked up twice, she was out.

Skip to the gathering, everyone is having a good time. It's hot AF so most of us guys are just in just shorts. I see SIL and Luci giving us dirty looks, but I just ignore them.

I go to the bathroom and when I come out, there's SIL, standing like a bloody harpy. She goes off to say to cover my chest and ""how dare I show such perversion to her kids and God Almighty.""

I tell her to either GTFO or STFU and went back to the others.

Later the subject of our marriage came up, and SIL just had to jump in with snide remarks.

She was pretty drunk and went off on another tangent how we weren't ""actual men"", it ""wasn't an actual marriage in the eyes of God Almighty, how we were just women who went too far."" She repeatedly pointed at my chest and said how disgusting it was, how I was ""a predator, and showing inappropriate things to her children, trying to tempt them from God almighty with my chest and wild ideas of what women are able to do, how I seduced her 'sister' into becoming a fag"", etc. Then the crotch goblin began saying the same shit.

I was pissed and said they were being extremely homophobic.

SIL says that it's just her faith and if my DH wanted, she knew a plastic surgeon who could ""fix"" him after he ditched me and realized he was a woman.

My IL looked ready to tear her 16 new ones, but I beat them to it. I told her a lot of shit about her life that was disgraceful in her religion, said that if she wanted to hide behind her faith, it would be her faith that would be taking her for vacation and pith in on Luci's college fund.

SIL tried to argue, but I threw her and Luci out of the house.

DH was broken up about it, he'd always looked up to her.

Later, I got a long ass message from the SIL how this was all because I didn't want to hide my scars, then demanded we pay for Luci's college and pay for the vacay because it's our ""moral obligation as women"". This was followed by bargaining, pleading, yelling over text from her, and some nasty messages from the hill billies of DH family who had rallied behind SIL and Luci.

493,WIBTA for making my husband choose less expensive orthodontics?,89,No A-holes here,110,hr2j39,1594765782.0,"So my husband (41M) never had braces as a kid. We have two kids, ages 6 and almost-4. We do fine financially, but are not wealthy. 

Last year, husband‚Äôs dentist noticed that his front teeth were chipping. He built them back up with enamel, and told my husband he needed to get his bite issues addressed. This year, his dentist needed to build the enamel back up again because it had already chipped off. The dentist told my husband that he really, really has no choice but to get braces. He referred my husband to an orthodontist, who quoted $6000 for Invisalign. We have $1000 in an HSA we can use towards this and our dental plan will pay $1000, so we‚Äôre looking at $4000 out of pocket for this option. 

We have a friend who works for a large dental chain. I have not heard great things about this chain, but they do Invisalign for $4000, and our friend says that Invisalign is Invisalign, wherever you get it done. (The friend is not a dentist or hygienist - he fabricates dentures and crowns.) Invisalign through the chain would run us about $2000 out of pocket. 

I asked my husband to also get a quote for metal braces from the orthodontist, since those are usually less expensive. He said no - he doesn‚Äôt want metal braces. He wants to just do Invisalign through the orthodontist. He doesn‚Äôt trust the chain place, and his dentist said that he should not go to the chain place and should see a real orthodontist.

I obviously want the best for my husband, but the difference between $2000 and $4000 out of pocket in the next year is a lot of money in our world.

When my daughter was 15, she came out to me as a lesbian. I deeply regret my reaction but it was out of surprise more than hatred. We have no gays or lesbians in the family so it was a first. Plus she was and still is my baby girl and it upset me to realize she is thinking about sexual relationships already enough to realize she has a different sexuality. My other child is a boy too so I was also expecting to do plenty of things only with my daughter, talking about boys (when she'd be a bit older), then marriage planning, etc...

So that day I said things I regret, that it was just a phase, she was doing it to spite me. She was very rebellious too at the time so that's why I assumed. I now know it wasn't a phase, and I wish I could go back in time. I now fully accept my daughter's sexuality and she is in a relationship with a good woman.

They are getting married in about two years. And as we were talking about it (via texts) ... I was informed that I would not be involved in the planning. At all. No dress shopping, nothing. I'll be a guest. I was extremely upset and asked why... She said she hasn't forgiven me for the way I treated her when she came out. She said I said things that can't be forgiven, so I asked what things and she told me, and I can guarantee I NEVER said those things. She also said we weren't close anyway. She moved away in another country so it's not my fault.

I asked who would do the mother of the bride parts of the wedding then, trying to make her realize it was absurd to exclude your own MOTHER. She said it would be her MIL. That she was closer to her MIL than me. It broke me. I'm not even my own daughter's mother in her eyes.

I refuse to attend a wedding to watch some travesty where another woman plays mom with my daughter, so I told her I wouldn't attend unless I get my proper role in it, and she left me on read.

I'm 24 (male) and met this guy 53, back in October. I had just come back from overseas after graduating, so I've been living with my parents since. As we met on an app, we both wanted a one night thing, but it turned out we fell for each other and had been seeing each other every now and then. I was raised in a very respectful family where children obey the house rules, no matter their age, as they don't pay rent, food or bills, so my parents have to know when I hang out. On his side, he lives with his partner, so he isn't free whenever he wants. (I know this is bad, but he is in an open relationship).
After only a few months, he wanted to leave everything for me, so we could start something together, but I wasn't ready as I still hadn't found a job. He has been pretty cold since this day, even though I told him that once I get a job, we could have our own place. The problem is that I don't want him to leave everything he has for me, as I don't have a job.
Recently, he got angry at me for having it too easy (as my parents have money and get me everything I need) and not taking risks to be with him. We met to discuss this, but he was so furious that he didn't want to understand my situation. My parents are actually a great support, as they offer to pay for my first car, my first apartment and even help me find a job through their network. As I'm young, I don't want to jeopardize my career for a man that I met on an app who gets easily angry when I don't do things his way. Also, if my parents learn about me not taking all the opportunities that I have in life just for a guy I met on an app, I would lose all their support.

They were an independent old couple, but they couldn't do strenuous tasks such as shoveling snow, mowing lawn, gardening etc. as the husband had a rare muscle disease ever since he was a teenager, and the wife had grown frail over the years. 

Every time it snowed, or they needed their lawn mowed, anything they needed, I would do my best to help them. My brother would help sometimes, but rarely ever helped, as he was never a morning person, and had his own life and reasons. 

The old couple would try to pay me, and I would turn down constantly, saying I don't need it, my pockets are full etc etc. Then my mom came into the picture. She would come out to help and go to the porch to wait for them to come out, taking any money they wished to grab. 

Finally, they would start calling my name and asking for me to come inside, that's when I saw that he was a coin collector. I asked about his coins, what type he collected, etc etc. He was surprised someone younger like me would be that interested in collecting coins. It became a routine that every time something came up, he would tell me about his new coins. 

At one point, he told me I would get his entire coin collection when he passed. I felt honored, and had no idea what to say! I told my mother, and she was confused, but believed me, and was happy.

Jump to about 2 months ago, and the old man died due to a bout with bone cancer. Instantly I was shocked, and sad. My mom on the other hand, was excited. She asked things like ""when are you getting the collection?"" and ""what are you gonna do with it?"". This gave me a weird feeling, but I thought nothing of it. 

Eventually I did get his collection, and after going through it, it was estimated I might have around $50K-$100K! I was floored! I told my parents I was going to sort through it all, and I was going to keep the more expensive coins to myself, saving them for later in life, and selling duplicates, or the lesser coins. My mom would joke at ""maybe you should start paying some rent, hahaha"" and odd comments saying I should start to contribute to the house more. My dad was not for it, saying I should save these for my education, and for later in life. 

All throughout the next months, my mom would look through my collection, eyeing up the expensive pieces, and would ask ""are you giving some to your brother?"". I would say I would share some of it, but not a large portion, as he didn't go over to help nearly as much, and I generally had a bond with the old man. My mom didn't like this response. She was calling me ""an asshole"", ""greedy"", and would tell my dad behind my back ""that boy is selfish, he always has been"". I'll admit in the past I've been a bit stingy when it comes to spending money, but nothing ever extremely selfish, I would always offer to help my family, and even suggested that part of my pay checks go towards house upgrades in the future.

I own a business in a state where weed is not legal. Recently some new tenants moved into the apartments above my store and since they have moved in, most mornings when I come to work my store smells like pot. I have no problem with people who smoke pot, I've been around it many times at parties, and normally I don't care about it. I personally don't smoke but that's just my preference. The only reason I care is because I don't want my business to smell like pot. Air fresheners do not always cut it.

I want to mention this to my landlord so that they stop. Here's the kicker - the apartments above my store are rented by the Department of Corrections (might be DOJ) and the people living there are either recently released from jail/prison or on parole. I do not plan on reporting it to the police, just my landlord. What he does is up to him.

Today has been pretty full as I woke up, received multiple calls, had to go to the office to deal with some things, got back and offered him lunch, then got back to work as soon as possible and received even more calls plus one group videocall (that only made me waste one hour of my time). Everytime I was not on the phone he tried to talk about stuff (not important, like discussions other people were having in a group chat, or something he was reading). I voiced my frustration at having many overlapping tasks on my schedule, he said it's ""cute"" I get very invested in work and don't notice stuff like him getting up to eat etc.

I also work with social media so earlier I was posting an IG story for my company while he interrupted me for a short kiss. No big deal, I'll gladly take it. I moved on to another task, I was on Teams with my colleague writing about the project while he asked me questions, and at one point I just basically laughed/cried in stress ""Please, please don't ask me now, I'm doing stuff, you can see it, I can't pay attention and I don't want NOT to reply to you or not listen to you"" and he got offended. Said he could not see I was busy, didn't look like it to him (maybe because of the IG story which is still work?), and I just should have told him (which I have?). According to him I ""whined like a child"" and he left the room.

I've tried to ask him not to start any more than small talk when I'm busy, or asked him to leave the room if I have an important video call, which does not sound like much to me but he always feels neglected or kicked out (""But you always text me when you're working!"" yes, but I take my time, I don't need to listen and reply in the very moment I'm busy. ""You're kicking me out of the room!"" yes I am, I have work to do and I sadly have to look the part - and I feel like you making noises like coughing loudly or randomly commenting stuff or anything like that makes me look unprofessional).

Is this too much to ask? I mean his stay is almost over, so this is mostly me asking if I do make sense. I just don't think it's that hard to understand if someone is busy when they're in the same room and just had to answer call after call - but his reaction made me wonder.Am I the one who should apologize?",False,1594832296.0,2020-07-15 16:11:43

I came out as Non-binary recently and I changed my name!

I said yes at the time because I thought I would be able to explain it to them for him and have him just sit aside. Later I talked to my mom and said
""oh yeah I'll probably explain it to them myself"" and she responded with
""Oh no he doesn't want you to do that, he won't budge on it I've talked to him""
And she went on about one of their kids seeing a therapist and that he doesn't want anymore problems.

I'm thinking of trying to confront him and telling him myself that it causes me dysphoria to be called by my old prounouns and deadname and that it'd be too hard to visit his house.

Our dad past away when we were quite young and my mother past away 3 years ago. My mother was sick for a couple of years and my sister was her main caregiver. 

I was still in college and she was/is a stay at home mom so she decided that she wanted to take care of our mother herself and she did amazing. 

When my mother died we were both obviously sad but my sister was wrecked. She had become closer to our mom in the years caring for her and now not only missed our mom but also felt extremely empty. She has had trouble with depression since then. 

She is not as bad as she was the first year, but she is also not getting much better. And she doesn‚Äôt want to go to therapy because she doesn‚Äôt like discussing things with strangers (her words) 

She had a daughter (6) and she is doing the best she can to shield her from her own troubles and she puts on a brave face for her. And she is doing quite ok with it. On real bad days her husband takes a day of or she stays with me for a night. 

Her husband is one of the sweetest people I‚Äôve met but also one of the biggest pushovers. He works more than full time, he‚Äôs doing well enough that they‚Äôre financially well of but can‚Äôt afford to work a lot less. My sister is ademend about giving her daughter the best live possible so she doesn‚Äôt want him working less.

Disclaimer for you Americans: I live in the UK, where we don‚Äôt have roommates. Instead we have flatmates (normally 4-6 people to a flat) where everyone has their own bedroom & bathroom and a shared kitchen/living room. 

I (F20) am about to start my 3rd year of university. My mum‚Äôs friend‚Äôs daughter ‚ÄúLeah‚Äù is 18 and starting university this September. 

Now, almost everyone will probably have had a nightmare flatmate at some point - all of my friends had. I, however, lucked out. All 5 of my flatmates in my first year were amazing and we were very compatible despite being randomly assigned. We made the decision at the end of first year to keep living together, and have done the same this year. 

My mom‚Äôs friend wanted me to talk to Leah about university and the flatmate-situation, because she knows that I got along really well with my flatmates. Well, when it came to it, I gently let Leah know that she shouldn‚Äôt have the same expectations of her flatmates as mine. 

My words exactly were: ‚ÄúWith 5 strangers, it‚Äôs pretty likely that you won‚Äôt get on with at least one of them. Among them, you‚Äôll probably find a great friend and you undoubtedly will enjoy your time at university, but don‚Äôt expect to make five best friends out of your flatmates.‚Äù Seriously, I‚Äôve heard of some psycho flatmate stories from friends, and I wanted to give Leah some sincere advice as well as reassuring her. 

Leah seemed to take it well, but she seemed kinda taken aback by me saying that she won‚Äôt make best friends with them all. We had a good talk about some of the realities of uni, as well as some of the enjoyable parts, and she went home. I thought I‚Äôd actually done really well on talking to her, and she understood me pretty well. 

But, I‚Äôm sure you can see where this is going. Leah‚Äôs mum called me later in the evening to tell me that I‚Äôd ‚Äúmade Leah cry‚Äù and ‚Äúbroken her heart about her flatmates‚Äù. I was literally astonished. I didn‚Äôt say it aloud, but I was kind of shocked that someone as intelligent and headstrong as Leah really thought she‚Äôd become best friends with 5 randomly assigned strangers, especially considering that she seemed to understand when I told her. 

I‚Äôm kind of in two minds about this - should I have let Leah believe she‚Äôs going to be in the same predicament as me or is it good that I gave her a reality check? AITA?",False,False,2020-07-14 00:29:01

She left a nasty letter and got the post master involved because she almost hit my father the other day because she wasn‚Äôt looking at the road, speeding like a bat out of hell, and cut to the inside of the blind curve (which is the right of way of the incoming driver not the leaving driver). The 2 families that live on our road had to pay for a mirror to be installed which granted we needed it but at the end of the day it was only installed because she was an unsafe driver.

My family lives out in the sticks, but it‚Äôs only about 20 minutes by highway from the small town our post office is in. My biggest issue is with her package delivery.

I can't eat a lot of foods, and I get tired easily. I throw up often, and my boyfriend deals with these things.

My sensitivities to synthetic fragrances and cleaning products seem to be difficult for him to deal with. It's gotten to the point where certain products, if used in the house, can literally bring me to my knees and induce migraines and vomiting. 

I know these issues are hard to deal with. But they come in junction with being with me. I'm not forcing anyone to be with me, and it's completely understandable if someone decides that my health is a deal breaker for them. I am a Sick Person and that's something that I have to grapple with. 

I do not have time to grapple with my boyfriend acting annoyed with me when these things impact his life. Because for every little way that *his* life is impacted, mine is impacted a thousand times more acutely.

I put it down to 72, which is still higher than we‚Äôd like as our bedroom gets really hot, even with our portable AC unit. This was discussed with my sister in-law by my wife, who shared it with me. The premise being that we would communicate if it needed to change.

When my doctor first told my mom this, she agreed, but when we got home, nothing happened.

I've had to do this weight loss plan as secret as possible, because the last time I had shown that I was trying to get more active, my dad said ""Look who's finally exercising"", and that demotivated me quickly.

Just recently, my dad went to his doctor, and while he's actually at a healthy weight (as per his doctor), he's concerned about his cholesterol and sugar levels. He tells my mom, and seems it's of our culture, she's the one that makes all his food, so of course, she's the one that is in charge of what he eats.

I've been forced to help her do research, shop, and most importantly, prepare my dad's food during the day and serving him. 

All of this makes me furious.

Apparently my attitude seeped out. The day would usually go with my mom telling me what to make for my dad and reminding me to make sure my brothers ate and when afternoon would roll around, my dad would ask, ""What's for lunch"", I'd say I didn't know, he'd tell me to pull something together, and once he left upstairs waiting to be called for, I'd go back on my phone and scroll through social media. Once maybe half an hour or so passed, he'd call me again and I'd feign memory loss.

I was exhausted today and asleep throughout the day. My brother woke me for a bit to tell me my dad was asking about his food, I ignored him and went back to sleep. Some time passed and my dad wakes me up, angry, but I, as usual, feigned memory loss.

This evening he had a convo with my mom and I overheard him mentioning that I have an ""attitude"" whenever I have to serve him.

We usually do an hour in the gym then she goes to the sauna and swimming pool whilst I shower and wait in the waiting room for her to be done. I don't use the sauna or swimming pool because I'm embarrassed about my body, so the only option I really have it to wait until she is done.

My mum has been trying to pressure me into coming to the sauna, quite forcefully, for a while. I told her I don't feel confident but she wont take no for an answer. Part of the reason I don't feel confident is because she has been so rude about my weight in the past.

After a few months at the gym she mentions this guy who is ""creeping"" on her. Basically, some guy was talking to her in the sauna, they were getting along, and he started apparently eyeing my mother up and down and he made a possibly lewd remark.

I think it was something like, my mum saying she was annoyed at how fat her legs were and he said something like, ""well they look good to me"" then ensues a creepy smile.

My mum was quite taken aback by this, and has been telling me I need to come to the sauna and sit beside her so this guy leaves her alone. I feel personally this puts me in a very awkward position, because I know for a fact my mum will comment about my body and make me feel bad.

Their deposit was set at $250/person, so their total deposit was $500. Jeff paid me in cash, and I gave him a receipt. They signed a lease under both of their names and moved in.

During their time at the property, COVID struck and they got behind in their rent payments. At the time, they owed me about $1000 in past due rent.

After COVID, they broke up and she decided to move out but he wanted to remain at the property. I signed a new lease agreement with Jeff and Diane moved out. In the lease agreement, I specified that Jeff's security deposit and back rent would move over to his new lease. Jeff said he would get half of the back rent money owed from Diane to pay me off. I stated that the old balance due would carry over to the new lease, and whatever Diane and Jeff decided to do to pay me off between them, I didn't care. I just wanted to be paid eventually once the moratoriums end.

I e-mailed Diane about her security deposit on June 28, asking her where it should be sent. Diane moved out on July 1.

Rent was due by the 6th. Jeff and I conversed on the 6th and Jeff stated that the entire security deposit was his, so the other $250 should be sent back to him.

I thought about it and I didn't see any harm in this. I was returning the security deposit to a person that was on the lease agreement. How they decided to pay the security deposit, how could I know what their arrangements were between them? They paid in cash and they paid their rent under one account per month (not two accounts - one for each person). Plus, Diane hadn't gotten back to me since June 28 and it was already July 6 (10 days). I didn't figure that she would ever get back in touch with me.

I returned the security deposit to Jeff by deducting it against rent owed (so now they owe $750).

Diane finally got in contact with me on July 9 and stated I could send her a check to the leased property address and she would pick it up. I stated that I already returned the money to Jeff, who was someone on the lease agreement, and that if she wanted her money she needs to talk with Jeff.

Diane is pissed that I gave away her security deposit. I tried explaining to her that I returned the security deposit to someone on the lease which is all that was required of me. She states that it's $250/person and that she contributed $250. She should get $250 back. Jeff states this is factually incorrect because he paid all of that with his own funds. Diane states all funds were shared between them so it came from both of them. She should get $250.

I stated that I deducted it against rent owed which both of them owed anyway. What's the difference? How they want to handle it, they can handle it between them.

AITA for returning the security deposit to the ""wrong"" person?

In the future, I'll definitely have it specified who gets what security deposit in the lease agreement. I never imagined that it would turn out like this. I think I could have done this better by communicating with Diane directly instead of waiting for her to respond.

EDIT: Slight edits for clarity. Original story is unchanged.

EDIT EDIT:

Diane's complaints are as follows (in her paraphrased words):

\- I sent her an email asking about deposit reimbursement but did not wait for her response (it took her 12 days to respond). So I emailed her about money that I really never intended to give back to her.

\- It's $250/person in the lease, and she was a person on the lease, so she's entitled to $250. Therefore, I gave away her money. (After looking at the lease, it does not state this. Instead, it states it's $500 for the room. But online advertising says it's $250 for a single occupant and $500 for a couple, so I could see how one could reasonably think this)

\- I immediately took Jeff for his word and didn't verify that with her

\- Now that I've already given the money to Jeff, I won't take it back from him and give it to her",False,1594683127.0,2020-07-13 21:24:26

I was actively involved in school activities and while my mom (57F) was at every showcase and every school play my father was a rare attendee.

When I was in late junior high/ early high school I was very very depressed and had to go to therapy. My therapist wanted my parents to participate and my mom was all in. My father, however, quit after just a few sessions for whatever reason (honestly I still don‚Äôt know why).

Today my parents had men coming over do do some work on the house. When the men arrived at the house my mom was on a work call so my father needed to deal with them. I went into our garage to tell him they were here and it did not go well. All I said to him was ‚ÄúThe work men are her could you go deal with them‚Äù and all hell broke lose. He yelled at me and said ‚ÄúYou WILL RESECT me‚Äù and I got fed up and said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù I told him that he had never been there for me when I was growing up and had never done anything to earn my respect. All he could do was yell ‚ÄúYOU WILL RESPECT ME‚Äù louder and louder. I said ‚Äúyou are throwing a temper tantrum, and only children throw tantrums like that‚Äù. At that point I was low key scared and said ‚ÄúJust deal with the work men‚Äù and ran upstairs to my room.

Later on my mom came into my room to talk about what had happened. I told her and she said ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your dad and you should respect him‚Äù at this point I told her ‚ÄúHe may be my father but he is NOT my dad‚Äù I let it all out and told her about how I felt and she just said ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt hold on to all that.

Or he tries to take any food I've made for myself instead of making his own or eating something that was made for the whole family. He never takes no for an answer and does whatever he wants.) Also he tends to patronize me for anything I do, so I know that he would try to put me down for anything I've watched. Well, he got into my account because I was watching it with a friend and it stayed logged in. He got in while I wasn't home, so he knew that he was going behind my back and watching it without my permission. He was halfway through Tiger King when I confronted him about it, and his only response was ""Tiger King is for adults.""

My church is like that as well and believes that homosexuality is a sin. My younger brother (13m) is high-functioning autistic. He's the baby of the family and the closest sibling is 4.5 years older. He is not stupid. He is too smart for his own good and uses it to his advantage. My parents enable and coddle him. And he knows it and milks it for all its worth. We'll call him J.

About a year ago, a family moved into the house across the street. They had 3 kids. A boy (S) (11) and two girls (9 & 4) I quickly became the go-to babysitter for them. The kids loved me. Never had any problems.

J and S quickly became good friends. They would play together often and run around the neighborhood. J has a filter problem. He often says anything that comes to mind as well as private family matters. To keep something a secret, we either don't tell J or have to really stress not to say it.

So yesterday while I'm at lunch with a family friend and my dad getting college advice, my dad gets a call from S's dad, D. He walks outside and talks while I am still getting advice. He comes back and I don't think anything of it. We head home and i work on college applications. 

I get a text at 6 from the family telling me that they don't need me for babysitting the next day, no explanation. I just assume something got cancelled.

At 9 that night, my dad says ""Hey your laundry is done and mom and I need to talk to you,"". I say ok and go to their room. My dad explains what the phonecall with D was about. 

D called my dad and said that J had told S that I was gay. He wanted to make sure my parents knew. I break down sobbing. We talk and I cry for an hour with them. More things were talked about but I won't drag on the story. 

My dad took J on a walk afterwards and talked to him about how he messed up and ""didn't protect me"" like men in our family are supposed to do.

I told my parents that they need to keep J out of my sight for a bit. They agree but idk how long they will let me ignore him. I know he didn't get the gravity of the situation 100% when he told S, but he still did.

WIBTA If I let an old co worker try to present my stolen work at an award conference, knowing he will get caught?

So this situation has me entirely pissed off and I am looking for some unbiased opinions on how I am handling this situation. 

To be absolutely clear- I am not looking for judgement on the fact that he is trying to pass my work as his own- I plan on doing something about it either way, but mutual friends think my plan takes it a bit too far. 

So about 6 months ago I left a company I had worked at for a very long time. Since I had been there a long time, I had several large design projects I was in charge of and I helped train new members coming onto the team. Enter ‚ÄúSteve‚Äù- I have never really meshed well with him as a person, he was very cocky and refused to take any fault for anything that went wrong in his life, work wise or personal. Regardless, we got along OK on a professional level and I helped train/mentor him as a designer in our field for over 4 years. Now during my tenure at my old company I created several large design projects that others would often use as templates- I am totally fine with that, it helps them learn tricks and shaves tons of development time. 

The problem occurs when Steve entered to present at a design conference, using work I created and passing it off on his own. An old co-worker/friend found out and told me via SnapChat tonight. I am totally pissed that he would do this, knowing he is trying to get an award off work he didn‚Äôt create. 

My co-worker asked what I was going to do or if I was going to confront him, and I said ‚Äúnothing‚Äù. I am planning on just sitting back and waiting. Why? Because I have won awards at this conference and I know something he doesn‚Äôt- they always check the embedded details of the file to ensure the license that created it matches the person who is submitting it. The design board would automatically catch him and his career/reputation in our field would be basically destroyed. 

This is my conundrum- old co-worker/friend thinks I am being to harsh and I should warn him first, confront him personally and not let him get caught publicly. It could just be an accident, he will reflect on his actions, he might try to submit something of his own‚Ä¶.etc. 

I am all for the public shaming on this one, but I admittedly didn‚Äôt like this dude to begin with and have a pretty bitchy/blunt personality so my viewpoint is very biased in this case.

As it gets closer to the end of my degree I have been discussing what and where I will go after I secure a job. I just want to have some type of plan. Every time I bring it up my mom brings up how I can stay at home and pay the bills for at least two years while she saves her money for a better place. The first couple of times I shot the plan down as I planned on living on my own but it ended up with us arguing do now I just say I will think about it.

Last month when I brought it up she said if I continued to live with her for another I could get a cat. (She knows I've always wanted one and I can't have one currently because of her health.) I told her I would rather live on my own and get my own cat and she asked for me to just think about it. 

A couple weeks later she brought up that I and my sister who is in college (she is supposed to graduate at the same time as me) could live together for 2-3 years. I would use my paychecks from my job (I would be paid once a month) to pay the rent. My sister would pay the other bills and my mom would save her pay so that once the 2-3 years are up we could move out and she would have enough money to pay the bills by herself. I immediately shot the plan because I know my sister would never go along with that plan and I definitely don't want to either. She got upset with me when I told her that wouldn't work and dropped it.

Well I tried to bring it up again today and she asked would I mind moving into *state that she enjoys visiting* and I said no as I have been to that state and do not enjoy it. I then asked why and she said that wherever I go she will be going with me as she can't do all the bills by herself.

My mother told my fianc√®e that she along with my brother and a friend will be flying over to have a small birthday party for me in a hotel room. My fiancee knowing how I feel about the entire situation told me and I told her to hint at me not wanting us to do anything since the risks outweighs the reward significantly.

Last time I spoke with my mother she hinted at coming to visit after I said people need to be patient and cut down on unnecessary travel, gatherings, etc... to paraphrase, my mother replied, ...""well you know I'm hard headed"". 

My fianc√®e and I have been taking every precaution, sanitizing masks, cleaning daily, removing shoes when entering our place, cutting down on store visits ordering delivery, etc... 

I don't want to go because it's too risky, I don't want visitors that have just got off of a plane because it's too risky, the entire situation seems selfish on my mother's part.

So I asked my hubs why and he told me that his friend- let's call him R- and another guy - C- have started buying drugs together because it is cheaper and then they split it and sell for a higher profit to their buyers. They are using our property as a drop/exchange spot because there are less eyes here than at their homes. I asked what they were buying- because even though I dont smoke or do anything I fully believe weed should be legal across the whole country- and my husband told me weed, dabs and ecstacy.  I kinda freaked out over the ecstacy- and my husband was like ""chill out it's only to keep you awake- I've even taken it"" and I was like ""when!?"" And he said ""two weeks ago?"" And I freaked out on him. I told him I was in NO way okay with that or them doing their exchanges here. We have 2 kids, this is our home, and it should be a drug free space (my husband doesnt smoke weed in the house).  My husband rolled his eyes at me and went outside. I messaged friends asking if I was over reacting and they told me I wasn't. But my husband- and his brother- dont see anything wrong with this situation and refuse to tell them to meet somewhere else. I looked up ecstacy and it is an automatic felony charge with a minimal 10,000$ fine and 2 years in prison here in Texas. So since no one else was doing anything about it- I slept on it for a few days and then made a report into crime stoppers. I know what this means- they could be arrested and in prison for a long time. But C just got shot twice in the stomach during one of his deals, and I have caught R doing coke outside of my daughters room before. It was 3 years ago and with my husband and I cussed them both out- and they apologized and said it would never happen again
 And I thought it was a done thing, the drugs. I thought my husband was only smoking weed or dabs. I know my relationship is probably about to end- we've been together 11 years and he's turned into an alcoholic and now a drug user since meeting R.

We started dating in Tokyo while I was finishing my studies, then we came to Colombia and got married here since same sex marriage is not legalized in Japan, curiously enough my wife liked it here more.

Anyway, when my mom and my wife met, I had to change many details during translation to help them get along, is not that they had radically different ideas, it was more because of cultural differences and I didn't want that to damage their interactions, I was also nervous because I came out to her during the wedding announcement.

My mom wanted to make her some local desserts because I used to tell her that japanese food tastes really bland, she thought my wife would appreciate it, but she was too used to the blandness in food, so she didn't enjoy the ones with strong flavors and out of courtesy she bowed and said it didn't fit her taste, I didn't want to disappoint my mom, so I told her she said ""it was very delicious, I'm impressed"" my mom got excited and got up to the kitchen to bring her some more, and I told my wife ""she says she'll try to make better dishes next time"" and then stop my mom from bringing her more.

One day, my mom came for my birthday and brought all my ex girlfriends with her.

I'm from a small town where she lives right now, and came to my house with 3 girls that she thinks were my best friends, it was hell.

I wasn't out to my mom back then, but my wife knew all of them were my exes because we talked about them and I showed her pictures, I also didn't want to tell my mom that I dated all these girls she brought, worrying that she would think badly of me, but my wife thinks it's really disgraceful to lie to your parents so I told her that she knew they were my exes.

I had to change basically everything they asked about each other and compromising contexts to keep my mom and wife oblivious of the situation, my wife would ask in front of my mom to one of them ""how was dating me"" and I changed it to ""was I a good friend?""

It was honestly exhausting and I don't even remember what I said.

Eventually she started learning spanish, and by the time she got confident enough to hold a conversation with my mom, they both noticed how many small details they thought they knew about each other, weren't... Exactly accurate, and they found out that I was the source of the incoherent information.

My wife, who has never been really angry at me stopped talking to me since yesterday when I admitted what I did, she said a translator duty is to be faithful to the meaning and not interfere with it and that basically what I did was lie to her and my mom.

553,AITA for being mad at my partner for telling his mum I lost my job?,63,Not the A-hole,32,honev6,1594410019.0,"Let me just give you some background first.. My partner and his mum are very close. Since lockdown he has moved back in with his mum (130m away) as his place was too small to work from home. His mum occasionally makes comments about me that make me feel awful so I don't like her knowing too much about what's going on in my life.

I went to see him about a month ago when lockdown restrictions were eased enough to allow couples in long distance relationships to see each other. While I was there his mum was saying that we should look for a place to move in together that was convenient for his job because he is the one in a secure job while I'm not (I was on furlough). I tried to explain to her that when the time comes, where we move to will be our decision and we will try to find somewhere that is convenient for both of us rather than just one person.

A few days after this conversation, I was made redundant due to Covid19. I told my partner and asked him not to tell his mum because I wanted to avoid any hurtful comments she might make about it.

Yesterday, his mum sent me a job vacancy in a pub. There was no 'sorry to hear about your job' 'are you okay?'. Just 'this just got posted'. I immediately text him to ask if he'd told her and he said he had told her some weeks ago because she kept asking what's happening with my work situation. I got mad and upset. I was hurt, I feel like I can't trust him anymore. I said to him had he just told me she kept asking I probably would have agreed to tell her. He also said he wasn't going to tell me that he told her and has turned it into me making him lie to his mum.

I now feel horrible and am wondering if I was TA in this situation. But I am still adamant that he should have come forward and told me he told her rather me finding out when she sends me a random pub job that I more than overqualified for.

554,AITA for charging a woman for unnecessary saxophone lessons to pay back my parents?,63,Not the A-hole,22,hodg50,1594364570.0,"Throw away on mobile.

Last October I (28m) purchased my first home. My parents paid $300 to have it professionally cleaned as a house warming present. They used a woman we‚Äôll call Roxanne whose mother knows my mother. Well when I moved in the house was filthy. There was still dirt and dust everywhere and basically every room in the house had multiple issues. I asked my parents if they would contact the cleaner but they advised against it as my mother didn‚Äôt want to create tension between her and her friend. I ended up cleaning it myself.

Fast forward to last month. My mother tells me that she has a friend whose grandson wants to take saxophone lessons. Although I‚Äôm not a pro sax player by any means (tuba main) I‚Äôm still a music educator and know how to teach it. I charge $20 for half hour lessons. Our first lesson was fine but it was very apparent that he hadn‚Äôt played since early March when the schools closed due to Coronavirus. Which I get, sixth graders typically don‚Äôt have the best practice habits. I was basically teaching him how to play the instrument all over again. Most of what we were doing was a bandaid and he honestly would be better off waiting until band starts up again and he can get an hour of instruction every day rather than a half hour once a week with me. 

After our lesson ended I walked him out to his car and was prepared to tell his mother that I wanted to cancel lessons. My reasoning being that I didn‚Äôt want to make them pay when presumably the first month of school will be teaching the entire band the basics again. Although my lessons are helpful they aren‚Äôt totally necessary at the time. 

Here‚Äôs where I might be the asshole. His mother immediately tells me that she was the person who cleaned my house and started talking about how great she is at her business. I decided on the spot to continue doing lessons with her son without mentioning my concerns. At this point in time I‚Äôve had four lessons with the kid. My plan is to make the 300 dollars back and spend the money on my parents since they basically got ripped off.

Recently I've been really getting into taking care of my body again and I spend a lot of my time working out or going on walks. 

Yesterday I was on a walk, and I saw this empty playground with monkey bars, it somehow awakened something in me and I decided to just do a little upper body workout. I am very anxious and even just something silly like this takes courage for me to do.

I think about 10 minutes in, a woman walks by, and starts yelling at me if I think that's okay. At first I didn't even realise she was talking to me, because however odd, I honestly didn't see any harm in what I was doing. 

I tried to explain to her that if there were children that wanted to play or whatever of course I would let them,  I also mentioned that I did have sanitizer and cleaned the bars before and after use.

She didn't give me a reason as for why it was wrong for me to be there, and in my head I don't really think I did anything wrong, but maybe there is a reason that I didn't think of as of why it's wrong?

I‚Äôm also not that experienced, I‚Äôve been programming professionally for around 4 years, only 2 years with this language in particular. My salary is not that great either, I‚Äôm definitely earning less than most of my peers, but I‚Äôm comfortable in my job and I get along with my boss, so I figured earning less for now is not a priority. 

With covid-19 I‚Äôve been working from home, and you could say my boss has taken some.. liberties. she knows I‚Äôm home most of the time and that I have my work computer with me, so if there‚Äôs an urgent matter she will call me even if it‚Äôs at 10pm. I am not paid to work extra hours but I still do it because these issues are caused by my code not being solid enough, even though I learn fast I am still not THAT experienced.

I decided to take some days off a week ago, and what I feared most happened today. My boss called me because something urgent happened and wants me to work on it despite me being on holidays. I was kinda thrown off in the moment so I lied to her and said I was not at home for the day, I also acted very cold as I was feeling pretty mad to be called at work even if I‚Äôm just chilling at home with my computer next to me. 

I feel sorta guilty because I know its my unpolished programming skills causing these errors, but then again, shouldn‚Äôt I be able to enjoy my officially requested holidays? AITA for lying and being cold towards her?

So to give you guys some context, I‚Äôm (f16 almost 17) my mother is 50, my friend is (f15) now I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a cultural thing for me, or if it‚Äôs just cause i was taught to do it growing up, but I was taught to always give my parents a kiss before leaving somewhere or going to bed, obviously just a little peck on the lips or on the cheek and nothing more (usually the cheek though)

Recently my father passed and because of it I‚Äôve been somewhat more adamant about giving her a goodbye kiss or a goodnight kiss, also doing it when shes also leaving for a while if I‚Äôm staying home, I‚Äôm definitely not obsessive about it but it‚Äôs something that brings me a little peace, especially after my dad passing

Now a few weeks ago (possibly a month) my friend was over, we live close and usually hang out at her house but decided to hang out at my place because it‚Äôs summer and I have an ac and she doesn‚Äôt, my mom was on the way out to go to the store just to pick up the things we needed for the week, and I gave my mom a little peck on the cheek and did the usually I love you bye thing and sat back down with my friend

 she did look a little uncomfortable so I asked what was up and she said she found it really strange/weird that I kissed my mom and asked me if I could not do that in front of her again, I was a little confused but agreed because I understood not everyone was brought up to do things like that
 
Well a couple weeks later she was over again (like 2-3 weeks ago) and we were leaving my house just to head back to her place to grab a few things she forgot and again I absentmindedly gave my mom a kiss before leaving, she literally went ‚Äúugh gross‚Äù and walked out without me, I ran after her and asked what was up and she said something like ‚Äúit‚Äôs just gross to kiss your parents and you should stop, your not a little kid anymore‚Äù 

I just kinda became quiet because I didn‚Äôt really know how to respond to it, when we got to her place I helped her with a couple of things before making an excuse that I was tired and I wanted to take a nap and we could hang later, I honestly still don‚Äôt really know how to respond to that, of course we‚Äôve hung out multiple times after that but, I wanna respect her boundaries but I‚Äôm not gonna just completely stop giving my mom little cheek pecks/kisses just because someone told me too, and any time she‚Äôs over I try not to do it where she can see 

But every time she does catch me giving my mom a peck goodbye she always talks about how gross she things it is and goes on about it for a little while

Edit: I barely ever give my mom pecks on the lips because I realized how wrong people would perceive it as I‚Äôve gotten older, and I always make sure to NEVER do it when people are around, but every now and again I absentmindedly do it and just mentally remind myself not to do it next time",False,1594370764.0,2020-07-10 09:05:49

560,AITA for memorializing my ex-MILs facebook?,70,Not the A-hole,19,hrqhn0,1594858458.0," This is a long, and short story, but I think the details matter so bear with me.

The best starting point is that my now ex-husband, 7 year marriage, kids, etc, is mad at me for memorializing his deceased mothers facebook page after her death last year claiming it wasn't my place. Going so far as to publicly call me out using my maiden name to say I don't even deserve ""their"" name and saying I am not part of the family. Since yesterday he has been harassing me, calling me at 11pm, messaging me at midnight, posting on facebook. He claims I ""shut it down"" and they lost all her photos, which if you look at the the memorial info is not true.

Back story: The reason our marriage ended was that he had an affair, and not the first, but he got this one pregnant. It started while I was pregnant with our second, and continued until he got her pregnant and her then husband found out. We got divorced rather quietly about 3 years ago so not very many people know the real reason (I'm not one to cause a scene, I even found some of his items in my shed a few weeks ago and gave them back to him, sentimental stuff like his baby blanket) , and I know he demonizes me on the regular to make people think it was my fault. I now see how abusive it all was to say the least and this is only the tip of the iceberg, I am now just happy I made it out alive and stay as little contact as possible even co-parenting.

But back to the current issue. He is mad that I had a part in memorializing her page (I didn't even actually do it because we were no longer facebook friends, but suggested it to people who showed me what was happening and it was reported by more than 1 person). What he fails to share is that it was being used AFTER HER DEATH to message people and make comments that were, in my opinion, a disgraceful way to use her ""voice"". Messages to family/friends degrading them, telling them they must not believe in god for the way they are treating the family, and signing the messages with her actual name as if it actually came from her. Comments on posts backing the family in fights and quoting scriptures and things.

I loved this woman like my own mother. I moved states away from home to marry that man and moved away from everyone I knew, and with that I gained a new family that I was then (mostly) ejected from when he decided to do what he did. I saw her days before she passed, took the family food, grieved, I attended her funeral, he acknowledged at that time that she ""was like a mother to me"". It hurt me to see her memory being used that way, and it bothered anyone else who saw it or received messages as well, but to be fair as he said ""I am no longer family"".

I was told to pack my stuff and get out and to leave my son behind because I am the one being kicked out not him. When I replied that I will be taking MY son with me I got screamed at saying it‚Äôs not right for me to take away their baby.

They‚Äôre downright cruel to her. Antagonistic and causing problems.

I love them, they‚Äôre a huge part of my life, and the only other family I have, especially because my parents have alienated themselves from me.

I need my brothers in my wedding. I want them to be part of the ceremony. The only way they can come is if my parents bring them. We have no close relatives or friends who could bring them instead. 

We‚Äôre only having 20-30 people, most of them her family, so not having my brothers would really make the celebration feel hollow for me. 

I told my fianc√©e I have to invite my parents in order for my brothers could come. She‚Äôs very upset because she thinks if they come they‚Äôll ruin the day with cruel comments and their typical insane acts of sabotage. Her fears are justified, so I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm being an asshole by inviting them. But I‚Äôm also justified in wanting my brothers there. I‚Äôm at an impasse. I need impartiality.

For instance, if it has a computer/fuse block on top or if we have to go digging for it or, if we have to remove anything to get to it. The reason is that if we break it, the customer is in a way worse situation. 

So a lady calls in and asks if we can change her battery, my manager explains that we can't do all batteries and that we would have to take a look at it first. He literally says ""some have parts on top we can't mess with"" 

She comes to the store and I look at the battery, not only does it have a fuse box on top but it has corrosion under the fuse box (big no-no) I explain we can't because it could break EASILY. And had her keep the car running the whole time. I went into depth about why I couldnt change it. We part ways and I go back inside. She comes in a minute later and says ""I'm just gonna buy the battery and have y'all put it in"" 

I give her the whole rundown AGAIN. And then she gets pissed and goes outside and she's outside for a LONG time because she turned the car off.

570,AITA for snooping about a pregnancy?,54,Asshole,38,hoapts,1594355484.0,"I (23m) have been dating a girl (20f) for about 4 months, if you can call it that during corona virus. We have meetup a few times and I had indicated that I wanted a long term relationship and that honesty was something that is super important to me, I'd followed this and explained things I was slightly embarrassed about but didn't want to withhold from her. This seemed agreeable to her but we both agreed that taking it slow would be okay.

Recently I had seen a post on Facebook talking about pregnancy problems, specifically different sizes of belly during and the sort of social stigma/worry around that. She had commented to a friend of hers had been way different also. This made me ask the question of was she a mother? I started looking through her Facebook posts to see if there was any information, I had found mentions of a baby boy and all the lovey dovey stuff associated, but I didn't have anything concrete, just little flags. I decided to straight up ask, she explained that the pregnancy hadn't gone well and there was no baby, she apologised and explained that she didn't want to share about it to much. I completely sympathised and said she shouldn't be sorry and that I totally understand the situation, I was interested in how long ago this had all happened and the dates didn't quite add up from her other posts. I looked further and I reached a point where I couldn't shake that it wasn't the truth.

So I asked her again, she reacted defensively asking why I had been snooping and where I pulled up the baby's name from, which I understand but there was no explanation from her side . I answered honestly about looking through her Facebook (at the time of doing so we were friends).

I would seriously consider being in a relationship with someone who has children from a previous relationship, but my main concern here is the lack of honesty, at least from what my gut and the Facebook snooping are telling me. Maybe I've completely fucked things by accusing someone of lying about something so sensitive, but I don't think I could have let this go and I asked in a way that was as honest as possible.

I've been blocked now and I'm left wondering, AITA?

edit:I can see I've made a real blunder of my message, I hope I can clarify accurately.   
There wasn't any issue raised about talking about it, just that she didn't want to bring it up because it was sensitive, but I had brought it up and that she did explain what happened with the pregnancy, but the information she provided didn't match up to the information on her profile. Specifically in that she explained things ended poorly in October and the Facebook posts indicated things were okay and that there was indeed a baby boy in January. She felt comfortable enough to explain to me, but was upset when I pointed out the disparity in information. ",False,1594328877.0,2020-07-09 21:31:24
571,AITA for not supporting my (19F) pregnant sister's (29F) wedding?,58,Not the A-hole,14,ho86fx,1594347398.0,"It's a wall of text, I'm so sorry.

Hey. So, this thing happened literally a last night and I'm (F19) not sure how to feel about it.

My sister (Now, 29) had a first love back in high school. A time in which she was a bit wild. Skipping, drinking, drugs. The guy--let's call him James--cheated on her, and they broke up.

She got very depressed. My parent, who usually worked overseas, decided to let her drop out of high school and sweep her away to their place. So, at least they could supervise her.

When she was 20 she got pregnant & chose to not get married. The guy then chose to not get involved with the child. The child was raised by her with full support from the family.

Then, she met James again & they had an on-and-off relationship over the years. Whenever they went ""off"", however, they went off with a bang.

Even when they're ""on"", it's not that different.

Now, she got pregnant again. This time she decided to get married. Because *the baby is a sign*.

James and my sister made an effort. In the beginning, James doesn't even have a job. Now they recently had rented a place for themselves. They have kicked their drug habits.

It's also true that the family-- including me-- held James to an incredible standard. My family is a bit of a higher middle class. Not to say that James' family is not also the of similar stature. But James himself is a guy with not even 5 years of experience in the workforce. Even if it's only a small family of him, my sister, and this child, the standard would definitely be different compared to the first child.

The fact that he even wanted to raise a family without excessive help is even commendable.

By now, my parent had made their choice. They won't take care of this new baby the way they took care of my sister's first child (I have to add that during her on-and-off relationship, the first child was mostly taken care of by my mum). They won't let James walks through the gate, but my sister could come by anytime.

As things go on, although I'm not the type to outright said my agreement or disagreement, I just had more and more bad feelings.

Today, my sister came by to pick up something she left behind when she came over this morning. Then this conversation happened:

My Sister: Did you know? I gave my fabric to the tailor and it costs so much. Like, I can't believe it.

Me: Hmm, really?

MS: Yeah. Like... \**she kinda whispers*\* you don't wanna help me out a bit, baby sis?

Me: (*I tried to put my words as gently as I could, I swear I tried*) It's not that I couldn't, it's just that.. if you asked for help for you or the baby, I'll try. For the wedding, I just can't.

MS: \**kind of angry*\* well, I was just saying. Don't take it seriously. I wanted you to, at least, say if I should ask mum or something.

Then after having a few parting words, she left. Don't know if she would be back tomorrow.",False,False,2020-07-09 19:16:38
572,"AITA for leaving my shoes in the kitchen, and asking my mom not to put them on my bed?",59,Asshole,79,hqfd14,1594676105.0,"Every morning, i (16f) leave for swim practice, and come home through the garage. My house is built so the garage door leads into the kitchen. When coming home, I leave my shoes underneath the counter. Mom has told me multiple times that she would rather me not do that, but it's a bad habit of mine. I keep forgetting to put them where she wants them, but when I'm reminded I apologize and put them away.

Yesterday, my mom decided to take it upon herself to put my shoes away. Except, she put them on my bed. Muddy soles down. First of all, for a woman who yells at me about 'disrespecting my belongings' at least once a week, this is mildly hypocritical. Aside from that, I really just don't like it when shoes are on my bed, especially when they're dirty. I have to wash my sheets again, and i can't do that every time because i only have 2 sets of sheets for my bed. I understand that the easiest way to get this to stop is to not put my shoes in the kitchen, but this has happened before when i put my shoes by the stairs, and again when i had 'too many shoes downstairs'.

I asked my mom to not put them on my bed. Honestly, I was a little frustrated at the time, so my tone might not have been the nicest. She took my tone to be rude, and yelled at me for being 'disrespectful'. Mom told me I have to think of how SHE feels when she trips over my shoes (now that I think about it, there's no way for her to trip over my shoes I put them UNDER the counter). I tried to stay calm and continue to talk to her in a polite way, but i guess my tone wasn't polite enough, and she got more upset.

The conversation escalated and she threatened to ground me for a month, take away my phone, take away my license, not let me swim , etc. Now, normally when she starts punishing me I have three general options. I can: a) be quite, and have her yell at me for ignoring her, b) say ""ok"" and ""got it"" to acknowledge i'm hearing her, and be yelled at for having 'attitude', or c) cry and fight back, and get yelled at for disrespecting her authority and acting like a child. I chose option b this time.

The conversation escalated, and we both started yelling at each other. I mentioned how mature she was acting, and that pushed it further. Eventually, we quieted down.

Fast forward to today, I tried talking to her again. All I want is for her not to put my shoes on my bed. She could literally do anything else to put my shoes on my bed, and I would be fine. So I calmly asked if she could maybe try another way of reminding me. She said no, she's been telling me for months not to do that, ,and she's tired of it (its been 3 weeks since practice started again, so that's a bit of an exaggeration). I left the room so i wouldn't yell at her.

all I want is for her to not put my shoes on my bed, but AITA for leaving them in the kitchen in the first place?

She went on to say that she wishes she could get back to where her family lives more, which comes up pretty frequently. I asked her why she chose to move out here if this was going to be a constant issue. I guess what I said was less than cool, but her family treated her really poorly when she lived with them and took advantage of her and when she moved out here, she was thrilled to be leaving. So it rubs me the wrong way when she acts like she's missing out on not being around them. Then she got mad and told me that it's normal for families that live apart to see each other regularly and I disagreed. I'm poor. I grew up poor, I've always been poor.

We also just travelled across country to see my wife's family (on her parent's dime) on a lie her mother told about a dying family member because she wanted my wife to come out for her birthday. It was a terrible time that was very stressful for both of us and they made us sleep in the room where their dogs piss all day. I cannot see why my wife is so eager to do it again. I personally have no desire to go back there. They basically ignored us the whole time we were there and all we did was eat.

574,"AITA For letting my brothers express themselves, and then rubbing it in our families face?",57,Not the A-hole,47,hpcxk5,1594513879.0,"This might be pretty obvious, idk. 

So I 17m and my brothers 15, 14 + 3 all live with our grandparents. As soon as I'm legal, I'm adopting my boys and leaving. Grandparents are pretty chill, but they don't want us here. My mom was the reject kid, and we very rarely interacted with her family, so they don't wanna interact with us.  

My two middle brothers are currently regressed due to trauma, so they are mentally about 7/8. I'm working on getting them into therapy. My youngest brother is very special to all of us. Anyway, all three of them are amazing in their own regards, and extremely sensitive. 

I let them express themselves in a way that is less stressful. Dresses, skirts, dolls, everything typically girl. Now, the older two are very reserved about engaging with it, but do occasionally, and I honestly don't think they're ever happier. Mom used to play dress up with them, so I think that's why. 

The littlest isn't very reserved about his love for more feminine things. He will strut around dressed like Elsa, and he loves it. I don't think he owns one ""boy"" toy, besides gifts. He does have dresses and skirts that he wears in public, they make him happy and diaper changes are much easier without pants. Win in all situations.

My grandparents don't care. If one day he's their granddaughter, they're fine with that. The rest of the family isn't. We've had a lot of arguments recently because I'm letting him grow his hair.

Last night the lid popped and it was an hour of screaming. In the end I had to promise that I would not let him wear dresses again at which point everyone chilled. 

Apparently it makes them all really uncomfortable because of their own sons and daughters being around it, despite them all being practically adults. They also hate dresses with diapers, they never put their daughters in dresses when in diapers. Which I sort of understood, but he's my kid, so they can fuck off. 

Now that I've explained all that, here comes the part where I may be an asshole. I got paid and decided I could spoil the kids with this pay instead of saving it. Last we went online and picked every dress and pink thing he wanted. Somehow, family found out and it caused a huge rift (again). I went the extra mile and got him pink diapers (which cost a fortune, by the way) on my morning run and am now letting him walk around in them. 

My grandparents have put their foot down and basically no one is allowed to say anything when baby is in the room. They're kind of awful but they come through when it counts. So I'm just strapping my baby to my chest and walking around with him. Everyone is silently seething.

For some reason, my fianc√© insists he needs to spend around an hour in the bathroom to poop, and he does this 2-3x a day. We have gone round and round about it. He says he has no stomach troubles, is not constipated or having diarrhea, it is just his routine and he wants to make sure he is ""all done."" Only to repeat the process a few hours later! Yes, that means he is spending 2-4 hours in the bathroom EVERY DAY. He admits he is mostly playing on his phone, but refuses to cut down the time he spends. It is his routine and he enjoys it.

Okay, then. Unfortunately for me not only does that mean I'm constantly waiting on him and he interrupts our plans at home, I also can't use the bathroom while he's in there obviously. The thing is, we do have a second bathroom, but it is in the basement. Down a dark, narrow staircase. And the bathroom itself is fine but certainly not as nice as the upstairs bathroom. Since I have a small bladder and have to pee frequently, it means I am constantly running back and forth. And I'm tired of it. It doesn't feel fair that I don't get to use my own bathroom (to pee, shower, brush my teeth, put on makeup, refresh deodorant, grab medicine, change a tampon, etc, etc) for multiple hours of the day because he's decided to hog it.

So I have asked him before if he can go use the downstairs toilet if he knows he's going to be a while, but he refuses.

So I (at the time 18 f) was a shipping clerk for a agriculture company, my job was to coordinate with lift driver to make sure they put the right crates on the right trucks. At the job there was only one person who was licensed to drive the big fork lift (it can pick up 4 crates instead of two), he was the main person I talked to. Let‚Äôs call him Kevin. Kev was really cool, like a fun uncle type. Always down for a convo, always nice and ready to get work down. He did mess up quite a bit and I had to make him fix his mistakes.

I look down to my papers then BOMB. about 5 meters away, Kev had smashed into a small lift driver. This guy (call him Tim) was a new guy with long blonde dreadlocks. Never smiled. Never talked to anyone else. The site was a mess. Both vehicles were in pretty bad shape but the small lift was done for. A piece if it‚Äôs rear landed pretty close to me.

She will have a full meal plan with the school as well. 

My reason for doing this is mainly because I want her to be focused on her school work and be apart of the campus life.  It is a HBCU and before COVID, was full of activities (not sure what this year will be like). If she has the car she will try to leave to come back home any chance she gets to visit her HS girlfriend, who I think is a lovely young lady but like any teen relationship, not truly going anywhere.

Also, the school allows freshmen to have cars. I own her car so technically it‚Äôs not her car.

When we bought the ticket, we were undecided about when to return, but the agreement was always ""we'll go for two weeks, but stay for more if we want to"". During the first week, I was talking with my wife saying ""well we could stay a little longer, there's no reason to go home, and it's easy to relax with your parents looking after the kids."" The problem is that ten days in, I am exhausted living with the in-laws and need to get home to my life and my house. 

My wife, however, is not keen on returning. She has maternity leave until the end of august, and works in healthcare, so never is allowed any more than a week or so of leave at a time, so now is the only opportunity she can get to spend a long time here. Furthermore, the free childcare from her parents means she gets more of a chance to relax, time which neither of us have had since we are constantly entertaining and cleaning-up-after our son - which we will eventually have to return to.

As for me, I'm starting to really feel the stress of living with the in-laws, they treat my wife as their child (rightfully so), but I end up being lumped-in with this, despite being in my thirties and a father, which is *constantly* infuriating. There are comments about me doing anything in the house, such as getting a snack, getting coffee, going out of the house for a walk, going for a drive to the shop - comments which I don't get when living at home. When I drive them anywhere, the comments get worse, making sure I'm driving safely, commenting on directions, explaining everything simplistically. There's comments about making sure my son is safe when he does things, which I have managed to achieve by myself in his ten month lifespan without problems. It's infantilising and after this time is really grating. 

On top of this, my car is only insured for two weeks of international travel. To extend this, I - as the only one of us earning a wage - have to call my insurer (not easy in another country) and pay for an extension that I don't necessarily want, but I know it's hard for my wife in her situation. 

The other day, I bought the return train ticket on the day we were originally planning and my wife was not happy. She said ""You said we were going to stay for longer!"" and then got upset about us returning, and chastised me for going back on my word, and that I was depriving her of more time with her parents. I feel like shit having done it. We've been discussing on-and-off whether we would stay for another week, but we never said anything consequential, now she's really upset and quite resentful. 

Am I the asshole here? I feel like something went wrong along this process and could use some help.",False,False,2020-07-15 14:25:15
581,AITA for lying about where I'm from and my ability to speak English and Russian?,57,Asshole,25,hr1br9,1594761422.0,"I am American and I go to university in Lithuania, I spent the first year learning Lithuanian so the following year I can start my undergraduate in Lithuanian. The problem is, most young people (those under 30 i'd say) speak English in the big cities, Kaunas, Vilnius and Klaipeda, while everyone also speaks Russian, and most of the older people and occasionally younger people speak Polish as well, though that's mainly just in Vilnius and some border areas. Whenever I tried to speak Lithuanian, they hear my accent and just respond in English which was fucking annoying, then when i went to a small village i got berrated by the people there for speaking shit Lithuanian. At parties, whenever anyone asked where I was from and said America they'd all want to speak to me in English and have me improve their English and I got asked everyday, why the hell would i study here and not in America. 

I got so sick of this shit from now on I started telling people I was Bulgarian and I didn't speak English.Most of the other foreigners don't have this problem, nobody asks the Indians, Ukrainians or others why they're here.  Whenever I was anywhere, shop, train station, whatever and someone asked me where I'm from I always said Bulgarian or I just told them I can't speak English. Well eventually it caught up to me, as I told all my friends I made that I Bulgarian becuase I didn't want them to speak to me in Lithuanian. Look I know what you're going to say, you should just ask them to speak to you in Lithuanian, which I've tried before when I was doing a summer program in another city and nobody cared, they just kept speaking English becuase it was easier, which prevented me from learning it, and making good Lithuanian friends and being in a Lithuanian friend group, I didn't want to be a part of the expat groups.  Since all my friends are Lithuanians here, we only spoke to each other in Lithuanian which greatly improved my Lithuanian to the point where I no longer have issues speaking it and nobody ever tries to speak to me in English when i talk to them in Lithuanian. 

Recently, my mom called me and my friends heard me speaking perfect English, as its my native language, and they started accusing me of being a spy and all sorts of shit and they were fucking pissed as hell to which I confessed. Half of them thought it was fucking hilarious but the other half don't trust me anymore and its tearing our friend group apart.",False,False,2020-07-14 14:17:02
582,AITA for telling my mother she is to blame for a lot of my suffering because of her denial?,53,Not the A-hole,24,houx2l,1594436471.0,"I am 33F, diagnosed with ADD and autism as an adult.

Part of this is because my parents had always been in denial.  I am high functioning and have a high IQ. While it was blatantly clear I had ""problems"" from a young age (strong reactions to stimuli, constant headaches if in noisy rooms, problems concentrating once but hyper-focusing at other times), my parents were not really the kind of people to take mental health seriously.

I was considered rebellious, lazy, difficult, etc - up to the point I actually started believing it might be that. 

I had to drop out of high school because I had so much problems, but eventually got my country's version of a GED. I went on to study, and graduated - albeit with delay. My parents believed I ""pulled myself together"" and this would be the end of it.

I am 4 years ""behind"" on my peers but all in all I thought I did well. 

I can in fact come over as a normal person on first impression. Holding a job, and working full time has always sort of gone wrong, though. It always goes the same: I start out with a lot of courage, but some things (like multitasking, doing work in a noisy office, understanding priorities, etc) are inherently hard for me. Employers get less enthusiastic, contracts don't get extended, etc.

My country's national employment agency saw there was something wrong, and assigned me to a job coach  to see what I could do. Through her, I was encouraged to get tested. After this, I have been assigned a social worker, who will try to help me look for the possibility of jobs that could be suitable - perhaps get me an internship somewhere after this Covid business has settled. and evaluate how it goes.

For now, I have found a job that I do mostly remotely, for 10 hours a week, spread over 3 days. It has been hard for me. It has a higher learning curve than imagined, there's a lot of voice calls, some multitasking, etc.

Basically the job has made a few things harder - I feel more anxious, scatterbrained, and overall exhausted. I was lamenting about it to my mom, and felt on the verge of tears. She went into one of her ""you're exaggerating and being difficult"" modes. At some point she said something along the lines of ""you can't work, but you can have fun with your friend and drive him around!""

(For context, my best friend has been cooped up alone due to Covid, and as restrictions lifted here a bit, we decided to go on a ""one day road trip"")

I  exploded at her. I said that she did not want me to have one of the few things that makes me feel happy,  and that if she had not been in denial I'd had gotten me tested sooner I'd be doing so much better, because I'd have gotten help from a young age, instead of having failure after failure and not knowing why. I said that was irresponsible and it's bad parenting on her end.

She is now upset and still thinks I'm exaggerating. AITA?.",False,False,2020-07-10 20:01:11

She moved to our town in high school and didn't have very many friends because she's a little on the weird side. We got close due to extracurriculars and classes and I realized you just have to get to know her. Over the years we've been there for each other through breakups, fights, moving, vacations and even a cross country trip. Things sort of changed when we met our current boyfriends. I settled down more, had my son and got more responsible and basically stopped going out all together. B on the other hand went the complete opposite, she treats her bf like a babysitter. He's always having to take care of her after a night out or even a day of her just staying home and getting high/drinking all day. I felt like maybe her sudden change had to do with us having the baby or moving on in our life, so to show I wasn't leaving her behind we invited the two of them over for a cookout. While B and I were inside with the baby the men were off course outside manning the grill. We all laughed and ate and had a good time....or so I thought. Later that night my bf told me that Bs bf is trying to find a way to break it off. Yikes. I mulled over it all that night and ended up telling her the next morning that she needs to make a change or she's going to lose her bf. She waited until the afternoon to reply to my message and all she had said was if I have a positive pregnancy test lying around. I was shocked. I kept asking her what she needed it for and she replied well I can't get one positive right now but she could stop taking her birth control and have one soon enough! I'm at the point that I don't even know who she is anymore. My bf says I have to tell Bs bf to warn him because she's obviously lost it.

So I (21F) get that they would see each other during work hours. However, yesterday, her ex husband came over after dinner and my girlfriend said they were going to work on a project.

They are still in her office when I doze off. I wake up in the morning assuming he went home, since it was only a 5 mile drive from the house we were vacationing in in East Hampton, to Bridgehampton, where his house was, and it wasn't that late.

Yet when I walk into the kitchen I see him casually pouring himself a cup of coffee and asking me if I liked hash browns. I don't know if I'm just not a morning person, but it was pretty triggering because he had owned this house before their divorce, and he was clearly more at home in it than me.

My girlfriend walks in and they start talking and were ignoring my attempts to join the conversation ( it was not about work, just small talk), until I was practically pulling on my girlfriend's sleeve to get her attention.

I ask her why he stayed over, and why he could not have gone home. She gets offended and says I'm being rude and insecure, and that she was just being a hospitable business partner. Her ex husband starts petting the dog and says that it was his fault and he just missed the dog, but sits down and makes no motion to leave.

I immediately feel bad because I didn't want to keep him from his dog. My girlfriend says when you do business together, you're not supposed to mean to your business partner. Then she says that she has a problem with my mom, and is well within her rights to complain to the owner about my mom breaching her privacy, but she didn't ( when my mom told me she mistreated her when she was her waitress.)

585,AITA For Getting an Apartment Without Consulting My Grandparents,56,Not the A-hole,15,hoiqlw,1594385339.0,"Hey guys, my girl doesn‚Äôt have an account so I‚Äôm posting this on her behalf. 

A little context. My GF is 22, just graduated nursing school at the end of last year and was fortunate enough to almost immediately get hired at a hospital. For the first time ever she‚Äôs capable of being totally financially independent. Her grandmother and her aunt have basically been the financial support that got her through nursing school, loaning her money for classes, books, buying her a car, and even taking in her German Shepherd when he was no longer welcome at her house. All things that gf is very grateful for and has been paying back whenever she has extra money. 

It‚Äôs worth mentioning that her family has a history of being manipulative, and sometimes gossiping and lying behind each other‚Äôs backs to turn favor to or against some family member, a habit that both gf and I find exhausting. Also worth mentioning that gf has a shifty relationship with her mom, being sometimes on really good terms and sometimes really bad terms (mostly due to her moms psychology but that‚Äôs not entirely relevant here I don‚Äôt think). 

Now let me tell you about the issue. Last weekend her grandma said she has until the end of August to find a place for her dog, either gf gets her own place or pays her stepdad to let her keep the dog at home. Not entirely out of reason either the pup‚Äôs a lot of work. Her stepdad absolutely does not want the dog back and no amount of money will change his mind so looks like she‚Äôll be apartment hunting. Well just today, my gf found, applied for, and got approved for an apartment that would be perfect for her in price range, space, and being close to family and work! Amazing right?! I guess not. Both her grandma and aunt are entirely infuriated and - as they say - emotionally distraught that they were not consulted or asked for help beforehand. More so, they kept mentioning that they were insulted that gf‚Äôs mom (whom she‚Äôs been on good terms with all year but was not on good terms throughout all nursing school) was the first to find out and celebrate with her (there really wasn‚Äôt much more celebrating than ‚Äúomg you got the apartment how great‚Äù). They aren‚Äôt even answering messages or calls other than to say how hurt and disappointed they are that they were never consulted or given the chance to help, and are now being tossed aside now that gf has income even tho they helped her throughout all her nursing career. On top of everything, the apartment won‚Äôt be ready until late September, and they‚Äôre now saying that the dog has to be out by end of August and she‚Äôll have to figure out where to keep him in the interim. 

Me personally think that they are emotionally gaslighting her, but to what end I don‚Äôt knowy. Gf is feeling really good about this new apartment and this new change, and is overall very happy and excited with her decision, but she has lingering doubts on whether she acted out of line.

We used to only see Mary occasionally for the first year or so that we were renting. Then she offered to feed out cats when we went away for a weekend, we took her up on it and were very grateful. 

After that she started to pop in for about an hour every Sunday at the same time, this was fine as we knew to expect her. She then started to regularly ask for small - large favors from me and my SO, nothing major but it definitely got a bit irritating to be asked to do something every time she came over.

It went from every Sunday to any day that I was home, if I had time off work etc Mary would call over for a visit. I dismissed it as loneliness and would never give any indication to her that I didn't like her constant visits (I have a very hard time being assertive or saying no, I'm my own worst enemy!)

Then the lockdown happened. She began to visit every day. Asked us to ""temporarily"" do her food shopping which was again fine but she would get pissy if we weren't able to get everything on her list. As the restrictions eased we said we were going back to getting our food delivered so we wouldn't be able to get her shopping anymore. She asked for us to include her shopping when we are placing our online orders ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Unfortunately Mary had a bad fall. I brought her to the doctor and for an x-ray. She had to get an operation and is currently still in hospital. The hospital is about a 2 hour round trip from my house. Mary asked me to bring over her slippers yesterday, and then asked for more clothes today ( I did ask if she needed anything else on the first trip!). She then asked me and my SO to move her bedroom furniture downstairs before she comes home and assumed that I would be collecting her from the hospital. 

She has a very wealthy brother who is also my landlord and lives 2 minutes from her house. He has thanked me for my help but is not making any moves towards taking over as a carer/getting her help.

I'm so stressed and my anxiety is sky-high over the thoughts of her coming home. I've seen her turn on people very quickly and despite all we have done for her thus far I think she will hate me if I try to be honest/set boundaries.

Yes. she is her stepmother, but my daughter doesn't call her mom, momma or anything like that unless she is sick, but they have a good relationship and are very close.

So when I had the jewelry made I only included my son's birth date and stone, nothing for my daughter.

I expected my wife to be excited when I gave it to her, but she seemed confused. I asked if something was wrong and she told me they had forgotten to include the date and stone for my daughter and we'd have to get it fixed. I told her that it was intentional because I thought she would just want it for our son since she's not my daughter's mother.

That was the wrong thing to say. She told me that it was her daughter even if it was only through marriage and I was a jerk for thinking otherwise. She then demanded that I have it sent back and fixed.

I don't know if I want to fight her on this as far as fighting over whether or not we should include my daughter on the bracelet, but even if I should have included her, I don't think I can be blamed for not doing it.

598,AITA for stealing my little sister's hamster?,50,Not the A-hole,17,ho9skv,1594352529.0,"I (19f) class myself as a huge animal lover. I have a bunch of pets of my own, and I take pet care really seriously. I got all of my pets when I moved out a year ago, and ever since I moved out, my sister (6) has been begging my mom to let her have a hamster. My mom eventually agreed, under the condition that my sister would be responsible with the hamster, and she would not be allowed to give him away if she got bored of him. 

Inevitably, my sister did get sick of Hamilton hamster. She's 6 for God's sake, of course a child is going to get sick of cleaning out his cage, feeding him, watching him while he roams, etc. I feel like this is my mom's fault for refusing any care of Hamilton. I do think kids should have responsibility, but I don't think it's fair for a young kid's first responsibility to be a whole little life. 

So, recently I've started spending weekends with my parents because I've missed them loads, and I've found myself spending most of the weekend with Hamilton. He is a very friendly hamster if you know how to handle them. My sister obviously does not, and Hamilton bites her every time she puts her hand in the cage. I tried to teach her how to handle him properly, but she told me she hates him and just wants him to go away. I've been going for three weeks, and every week his cage has been gross and I've cleaned it. I've bought him more engaging pieces for his cage. I even bought him a new cage a few days before the incident occured. 

So, my sister cracked the cage hoping Hamilton would escape. She owned up to it straight away to my mom and I, saying that she 'knows hamsters can live fine in fields' and that he hates her so he'd be happier anyway. My mom sent my sister to her room. We found Hamilton after about two hours of searching, and I told my mom she needs to rehome Hamilton. I offered to take him. She kicked up a fuss, saying that my sister has to take care of him, no matter how shitty that care is. She said my sister's life lesson is more important than Hamilton's life. 

So, later that night I took it upon myself to take Hamilton back to my house. I told my sister about my plan, and she was pretty happy with it. My mom was not. She's furious with me for taking Hamilton, and I don't care. I think the life lesson of treating animals kindly is more important than her awful attempt at teaching responsibility.

599,AITA for leaving my home angry after my boyfriend undermined me infront of my child?,47,Everyone Sucks,52,hqov2u,1594706574.0,"30F, with 2 children, 9yo and 5yo males. My boyfriend (32M) and I have been dating for 4 years.

For the past month I have been in mental turmoil. Lost my job due to Covid and struggling to make ends meet, have lost loads of weight, cry often, etc. I'm slowly getting better after doing counseling twice a week via facetime but some days are still hard. 

So this morning started out horrible to say the least and I've been in a mood upon waking. I've tried removing myself from situations but have failed; due to me living on the 5th floor in New York City and being surrounded by my boyfriend and 2 kids. It's simply impossible. 

So just to give you guys a hint about my day... I spoke to my BF this morning regarding me being set off so he knows I'm in a bad mood. He said he would make the kids breakfast. 20 minutes later he asks me to finish cooking so he can shower. No big deal. I go in to lay down afterward and read a book. He comes in several times and plops down on the bed and starts blaring youtube videos. So I go on the porch to read. 15 minutes later he is out on the porch trying to get me to watch videos with him. I give him a stern look and say I need to be left alone for right now. He goes back inside. 

At this point both my boys have come out repeatedly to ask questions like ""Can I get water"" or ""Can I go to the bathroom"". Both questions that neither of them ask normally. Boyfriend comes out again and asks me what I am making for lunch. I'm pissed from being badgered and storm into the house. I make lunch, serve plates and lock myself in the bedroom. Boyfriend then proceeds to knock on the door 3 times for miscellaneous things (such as grabbing his belt, for no freaking reason). At this point I put up my book and go take a shower. All 3 of them continue to badger me by coming into the bathroom.

So now I'm making dinner. My youngest comes out several times after I told him to stay out of the kitchen. The last time he came out, my boyfriend is right behind him and starts saying things like ""Ooh careful, mommy's big mad today"". So I look at my son and tell him to get out and stay out because he knows better to be in the kitchen when I am cooking. My boyfriend proceeds to rip me a new AH saying I need to calm the fuck down. So, I left. Grabbed my keys and walked out. 

Now I'm getting texts saying I'm an AH for taking off.

EDIT: Yes, I did communicate multiple times that I wanted to be alone. No, I did not take this out on my kids. The only time I spoke to my kids in a ""harsh"" way was when I told him to get out of the kitchen and stay out, after already speaking to him multiple times about it. I have a strict rule of no kids allowed in the kitchen while I am cooking because they do not need to be around the stove. This is not a new rule, simply because I was having a bad day.

My sister and my dad came back from a small holiday outing last thursday (it's safe to travel, it's just not recommended, they did not go by plane, just to our neighbouring country). They got home at around 9:30 PM after driving a whole day and also going out to dinner at the best BBQ restaurant in our country (it's en route, and about an hour away from our home). I worked from 12 to 9 PM that same day, and got home around 10:25 (long commute, always). 

Now I work a pretty physically demanding job, nothing outrageous, but after a 9hr shift I'm pretty exhausted. I just want to eat dinner and go to sleep. 

Well because my sister and dad just came home they wanted to talk about their holiday, I was standing in the kitchen getting my frozen pizza out of the oven when my sister shouted to me ""can you bring me a slice of cake"". I was already trying to take both my glass of water, her glass of water that i got for her, and a pizza back to my chair to sit in and just recover from work honestly. So I cut of a slice of cake for her, shifted my pizza a little to the side and rested the cakeslice a little on the crust of the pizza. 

Now when a slice of cake hits a pizza, it obviously absorbs a little of the grease, nothing too major tbh and there wasn't even that much grease on the pizza to begin with. The cake was still totally fine when she picked it off my plate but her immedeate reaction was ""WTF ARE YOU DOING? YOU ARE RUINING MY SLICE OF CAKE!!!!! THIS IS SO NOT FUNNY OMG THIS IS DISGUSTING YOU'RE DISGUSTING"". As tired as I was I just laughed it off, I truly thought she was making a joke (I've seen her eat Nutella out of a jar ffs, a little pizza grease of a slice of cake isn't the worst thing in the world). She got really upset with me, stormed off angry upstairs to her room and left me sitting alone. 

Ever since then, she's been ignoring me, being short with me and just making a big deal out of everything (I use too many towels after I've showered???

602,AITA for comforting my mom instead of my gf?,46,Asshole,128,hq568u,1594628199.0,"A brief family history: My parents used to be cruel to her (as was I, but I was young and immature - I've changed now). They would stalk her and try to get her fired or evicted, and a whole bunch of other stuff. Every time my gf would make the effort to fix things for my sake, they'd ignore or threaten her. Then later, during family stuff, my gf would rarely go but when she did she said she felt judged and left out, and that I never included her. So she stopped trying entirely. I think my parents have changed but she doesn't believe it.

Well last Christmas, my gf surprised me by inviting my family to Christmas Eve with her family. It was the first time the two families were getting together. But I guess, in my gf's opinion, everything went wrong and is still hurt from how I acted. This is what I need judgment for. 

The doorbell rang (it was at her brother's house) and my gf told me I should greet the guests. I went by the door and was shocked to see my family come in. It took me a few seconds to even process they were really there. Then I started crying and hugging my mom thanking her for coming. Then I went to hug her brother and thanked him profusely for having them over. Then went back to hugging my brother and dad and was crying the whole time. This was when my gf said she started feeling hurt. That I barely thanked her or recognised how hard it was for her to set it up, since I hugged my family the whole time and thanked her brother but not her. Honestly I was just shocked. 

The whole night was great for me, and the most thoughtful gift from my gf. For years, I mostly spent Christmas Eve with her family, and this was the first time my family was there, so I didn't notice my gf was silent and feeling left out. And I saw my mom was feeling nervous so the whole night, I sat beside her and hugged her. After it was all over and we were leaving, she started crying in the car. She said she felt neglected, and that I spent the whole time comforting my mom when she felt she needed the comfort more, since in her opinion, the situation was harder on her. I told her that she had her whole family for comfort and she said that my mom also had her family, and that she's also not close with her family so she needed me and I wasn't there for her. She also was upset that I didn't firmly stop my dad from pressuring her into giving them grandchildren (I didn't know how) and that I didn't defend her when the first thing he said to her was that she got fat. Honestly, I didn't hear it since I was so emotional in the beginning. Well now she doesn't want to be involved in my family stuff since she said if it'll be like that again, there's no point. I know I could have handled it better, but I was just happy to see my family. I want them to hang out but my gf doesn't trust them and doesn't trust me to have her back around them.

Names changed just in case anyone I work with comes across this. 

I (19f) work at a teriyaki restaurant in my town. The owner of the restaurant is Korean, and only handles the financial duties for the restaurant, while her son in law (30m) runs the restaurant (if that makes sense?).

I have been working here for about 5 months, give or take. Minus the kitchen staff, there‚Äôs about 4 people working there including myself. Alex (24m) and Noah (18m) are the two employees I have uncomfortable experiences with. 

Noah doesn‚Äôt really understand personal space, and is constantly standing really close to me, watching whatever I‚Äôm doing or just staring at me. He‚Äôs touched me inappropriately a few times (a gentle caress on the back, arm) and I‚Äôve told the manager. The manager understood and said that Noah had been doing it to him too, so he will talk to him. He also decided he wouldn‚Äôt schedule me with Noah anymore. Noah has been here for about a month or two.

Now, Alex is the person I mainly has a huge problem with. This guy has decided he has fallen in love with me. Which scares me because I do not talk to him outside of work, and nothing I‚Äôve ever said to him would implicate that I like him. He‚Äôs constantly asking the kitchen staff, (I am actually pretty close with them!) who mainly speaks Spanish, on how to say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù, ‚ÄúI want to be with you tonight‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou are so beautiful‚Äù, only to repeat them back to me. He also constantly talks about how he needs a girlfriend. I‚Äôve pretty much been given huge obvious hints that I‚Äôm not interested. 

Things came to a pretty disturbing turn when the other day, during our shift, he asked me if he could try my drink. Well, what was left in the drink was basically just half the drink and half of any backwash. It was also many hours old (like 5-6). I told him this and discouraged him from drinking it. He proceeded to grab it, drink it all up, give a slight ‚Äúmoan‚Äù and tell me that it was really, really good.

Cue me, shivering, and immediately put off. I take my lunch break and start crying in my car because it was so off putting.

At the end of the shift, Alex proceeds to follow me to my car and give me his cash tips for that night. 

I‚Äôve told my manager what happened, and he told me it‚Äôs not his problem and he can‚Äôt do anything because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù problem. 

I‚Äôm at a loss. It seems like he only fixed things with Noah because it was affecting him too, but because josh doesn‚Äôt doing those things to him, it‚Äôs my problem only.

This is also a small family restaurant. No HR, no nothing. 

I feel a little bit like an asshole, since there would‚Äôve been no way for my manager to make my schedule so I wouldn‚Äôt work with either of them, as Alex is full time and Noah is part time. 

But at the same time.....I don‚Äôt know. My friends are telling me to leave, but I don‚Äôt want to leave over something kind of minor?

           A couple days ago I was playing basketball by myself in our driveway with the AirPods in my ear (as I do almost everyday). My mom came outside and after about 30 seconds of watching me, she walked over and started trying to take the ball from me. I think she was just trying to play, but at the time it was slightly irritating because I was working on my shots and didn't expect it. However, I just decided to go along with it. 
           About a minute later, she accidentally hit my ear with her fist and the left Airpod fell on the pavement. I went inside to make sure it wasn't broken, and it would not turn on or charge. My mom says if I want to replace them, I would have to pay the full price. All of my birthday money and Christmas money from the past 2 years can pay for about half of it, so I asked her if she could pay the other half since she kinda contributed to their breaking. She has been refusing to do so, because ""I shouldn't have been wearing them playing basketball"".
       
            I got these as a birthday present a couple years ago and I use them all the time, and right now I don't think i'll be able to replace them.

My cousin (~22M) is in a halfway house right now after getting busted for drugs. His father is basically a POS and when he gets released on probation my mom is going to file a motion for my cousin to come live with us since were the only family he respects and and she fears if he goes to live with his dad that he'll relapse. 

My grandma had custody of my cousin until she had passed away, and as a result my cousin never actually learned how to drive and doesnt have his license. He fears being behind the wheel of the car because he never had somebody sit down with him to teach him. 

My mom has told him that the first priority when he moves in with is is going to be to teach him to drive and get him a license. And I told my mom that I dont want to help teach him, and I dont want him driving my car (I'm 24F), nor do I want to have to share my car with him. 

When I was 18, I bought my car from a family friend for $2000, and I bought it all on my own, so my car is my baby. I dont want anything to happen to my car. 

My mom reassured me that hes going to buy his own car with his own money, but that's going to require him to save up the money for it when he gets a job. And knowing my mom, shes going to backpedal when he gets up here and tell me I should share my car with him until he can get his own. My mom is known for saying one thing but when the situation happens, shell backpedal and say that she had never said that in the first place. What she says goes. 

I know that since it's my car and the title is in my name, I get final say, but I have a feeling my moms going to try to manipulate me into giving in and letting him drive my car.

I have a dog, Kinder. I‚Äôve had him since I was 18 and love him to bits, training him and teaching him manners has always been really important to me.

Whenever there was a family event/reunion/get together/ whatever I used to ask if he could come. I‚Äôm totally ok with leaving him home, it‚Äôs not like I won‚Äôt go if he can‚Äôt go, but my family enjoys having him around and he likes to come.

However the first few times he came my family (specially my uncle D) would give him food from the table, scraps and whatever. I would always ask them not to as it‚Äôs bad for the dog (he always gets an upset stomach later) and bad for the training we‚Äôre doing about not begging for food. My uncle and my grandma would always laugh it off and my parents wouldn‚Äôt say anything to keep peace so after a few times I said I wouldn‚Äôt be bringing Kinder anymore, he could stay home and we could enjoy quality time without arguing. They said I was exaggerating, it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and there‚Äôs no reason for Kinder to stay home alone.

It all came to an end on a Christmas Day a few years ago. We got to my grandma‚Äôs place with my parents, uncle D and cousins. I brought Kinder because they all said they‚Äôd behave.

Well, they didn‚Äôt.

Whenever I looked at my uncle D he‚Äôd be feeding him something (potato chips, shrimp heads, meat, bread...).

To make things short my grandma started to cry, I started to cry, everyone started to scream at each other and I was accused of ‚Äúpurposefully ruining Christmas‚Äù. I went to another room to collect myself and a few minutes later my mum came to try and make peace between my grandma and uncle and me. We finished our meal but obviously the mood was ruined. 

I have taken my dog to very few family events since and whenever Kinder is around they always make sure to tell him how ‚Äúthis food looks so yummy but they‚Äôre not allowed to feed him because I will get upset‚Äù.

Outside dogs are pretty common where I am but this dog was dirty and tied up to a chain attached to a dog house. He said it was his roommate‚Äôs dog and his roommate moved out and told him he‚Äôd be taking the dog soon. I ended up helping him give the dog a bath and a larger chain. 

Eventually I learned that my ex is overall kind of a shitty person so we ended up breaking up. I felt so bad for the dog that was stuck outside in the small dog house on the chain... so I took him. I made it look like he broke his chain and got out but I really just went into the backyard and took him while my ex was at work.

612,"AITA for disagreeing with my husband about how to spend his ""birthday money""",50,Not the A-hole,52,hq3h31,1594621748.0,"The short of it is this: my husband was unexpectedly given around $625 from various family members for his birthday and I think (and he has previously agreed) that he should keep half of it to spend on himself and the other half should go towards some of our shared financial goals. He's now going back on that.

Context: We are over 50k in debt and my husband makes about 50k/ year. I am a stay at home mom. We currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment with two young kids. Our financial goals include paying down a big chunk of our debt by next year so we can at least rent a house so our kids can have a yard and more space. We've agreed that we are serious about this and all extra money needs to go to debt. 

Historical context: I married him not knowing he had a large sum of credit card debt (not the 50k referenced above, that's all shared at this point). Thousands of dollars that came from my parents (a wedding gift) and selling my car (got about $14k) went to paying down this debt. He has issues with spending money when he is emotional/ stressed. We've curbed that for the most part - meaning it's rarely if ever an issue at this point. We have a 5 year plan to pay off all debt, plus a $500 snowball per month to get there faster. Also selling one car. 

We had decided with our budget, he could spend about $100 on something for his birthday this year, then he unexpectedly received $625 from family. We were in the middle of a fight and not speaking when he received this money and he bought a ton of stuff on Amazon (this is a huge no bc of his history with spending, we talk about everything we spend money on). He returned some things he bought and was wanting to buy more saying it would even out. I told him I needed to see the refunds and write everything out. He said his plan was to spend $300 for himself for his birthday  and for $325 to go towards essentials for the family or debt. When we wrote it all out, it turns out he was about $40 over budget of the $300 and he still wanted to buy more. 

Que another fight. Now he is mad at me and is saying I can't tell him how to spend his money and he wants to spend the full $625 on himself. (For context that's more than our monthly grocery budget and could almost pay off an entire credit card). Also, $250 of it was already put into our bank account and used for essentials. 

AITA for being upset about this ? It makes me seriously question whether he values our common goals the way he claims he does. Sometimes you just have to be a grown up and do the responsible thing. In my mind he was being reasonable and then got upset seeing he couldn't buy more. He also is pushing to spend while he's upset and not discussing it rationally with me (again, a no in our relationship). 

And yes before you point it out, I know we have bigger problems.

Edited: clarity about the debt and our ability to pay it off

Update: This morning my husband apologized and said he never intended to spend the whole $625 on himself, he only said it because he was upset. He thought he had more to spend and was disappointed after going over everything and seeing that he he'd already reached the $300 limit he'd set for himself. This all would've been avoided if he'd just talked to me first. And yes, for those asking, they're definitely his kids. Thanks for the laugh though lmao.",False,1594661048.0,2020-07-12 23:29:08

She had a dog that was currently living with her aunt & uncle. She said she wanted to have the dog move in with us, and I told her I was fine with it as long as the dog was trained/well behaved. 

Well, issues arose. Multiple times a week, the dog would be left 12+ hours overnight while she stayed at guy‚Äôs houses after going to drink. (Note: she would also be at work all day before this, let the dog out quick, then go.) The dog would howl and scratch at the kennel all night and day long. Along with this, it wasn‚Äôt potty trained. At all. I mean multiple occurrences of poop and pee in our house everyday. Along with A LOT of my stuff being ruined. (Furniture, rugs, decor, etc.) I knew I said I was okay with her bringing the dog, so I never asked her to pay me back for any of this. 

I finally sat her down and told her I wasn‚Äôt okay with the situation. 1. Her being gone all the time wasn‚Äôt fair to the dog or me. 2. I was tired of my stuff being ruined and living with dog pee/poop.

We talked about it, and she said she understood where I was coming from. It continued. Once COVID came along, I decided to move home for the remainder of our lease. 

I went back the week before our lease was over to move out my last few things, and there was poop all over the floor, along with damaged carpet, pee stains, and the whole place reeked. Way worse than when I left. I don‚Äôt have a dog and didn‚Äôt want to be charged for it, so I stopped into the leasing office to loop them in on everything. They said they would asses it upon move out and go from there.

Not only was our $600 deposit each taken out, but an additional $3k bill. The bill was itemized, and my portion of the deposit covered more than the ‚Äútypical cleaning things‚Äù. Paint touch ups, additional clean in the oven, etc. The remainder of these items were lined out as dog damage. (Dog hair, dog poop on carpet, pee stains, ripped carpet, etc.)

I told her that I didn‚Äôt think it was fair for me to pay that, as I wasn‚Äôt the one with the dog. She ended up paying the bill, but told me I was a toxic friend for doing that to her, talked mad crap about me to all our friends, and blocked me on everything.

Last year she got into a bit of trouble (nothing illegal, just made some bad friends and got into some trouble with a boy over social media.) 
So recently my parents have been trying to help her find some better influences. My best friend is also my cousin and we hang out at lot. Frequently we hang out with her older brother, his friend, our other cousin and his girlfriend. We will go out to dinner, swim, play games, etc. 
A few weeks ago we had plans to go mini golfing, eat dinner, and play games. My parents encouraged me to invite my sister to go with us even though she was not invited. I refused but my parents kept prodding me to invite her because they wanted her to feel included and have some good influences. This is where I feel I could be TA because although they are my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù they are her cousins too. My reasoning for not inviting her is because she tends to steal the spotlight. She always takes over conversations and makes me feel less important to the conversation. 
The next week our group decided to go geocaching and swim after and again my parents pushed me to invite her. I refused but they kept making me feel guilty about leaving her out. A few days later my cousin/ best friend invited me to swim at her house and my parents encouraged me to invite her and I eventually caved and she ended up coming. The whole time she talked over me, jeopardized the conversation, and ‚Äústole the spotlight.‚Äù The next day my cousin and I had plans to ride our bikes and get a snack and my parents pushed me to invite my sister.

My daughter ""Wilma"" is the HS friend of my son. Her mom has neglected her even though she has a good job. No decent food in the house, only pizza and ranen noodles, no new shoes or glasses when she needs them, no lunch money. She graduated HS and her mom told her that night that she had 2 weeks to leave, she was being kicked out. After her mom kicked her out, she lived in a few places around our state. We'd help her move, buy good shoes, we paid for dental work she needed ($700) and I helped her get a picture ID and phone so she could get her first job. I've probably spent $4000 on her over 6 years.

Well, Wima got her drivers license, her boyfriend lent her the money to buy a car, i registered it in my name and paid the insurance on it. I never found out if she paid her boyfriend back. She moved out to Colorado with a friend in September, has had 3-4 different jobs since then. She paid $70 for the first month of car insurance and then nothing after that. I told myself that she'd make good on it and all kids need someone who's got their back. 

 In Feb she told me her battery was dead and she'd have to replace it. In may, she told me it was still dead and she didn't have the money to fix it. I got upset, because I'd been paying car insurance on a car thar had sat in the parking lot for 3 months. I sentvher the money to get a new battery and told her she had to get an inspection on the car so I could pay the property taxes. In my state (NC) they won't let you pay the taxes on a car unless its inspected.

Shr said she didn't have the money so I sent it. Then she didn't have the time and I told her to make the time. It was registered in my name and if she got into an accident or something happened, it would all come back on me. Then she told me she had a fender bender but that her new company she was working for would pay for it. She also told me she cussed out the cop who gave her the ticket. 

I told her that if she didn't take maintain the car, drive it properly and show up for her court date, i wouldnt be able to carry the insurance on it anymore. I warned her that she was burning her bridges. Wima freaked and said she would talk on the phone with me anymore, only text or email. She thought I was being unfair, that I was putting her new job in jeopardy by making her take off an afternoon to do this. Any boss understands that we all have stuff to do. I told her in NC, the inspection stations were open on Saturdays too.

We've  signed the title over to her to get out from under the responsibility for the car. I think she sold it. In my last email to her, I told her to get some therapy, because I'd seen that she had a habit of using people and throwing them away when her obligation to them got to be too much.

She said and did a lot of very hurtful things to me that she‚Äôs refused to acknowledge when I try and talk to her about them now, which is fine, but it means that I‚Äôm not sure I can have the kind of relationship with her that she clearly wants. 

My region has done very well handling the outbreak, and my family takes it very seriously. My mother doesn't allow anyone in our family to leave the house. They go for groceries about once every two and a half weeks (""they"" meaning her or my father - I am not allowed outdoors). I can't even go for walks anymore.

Instead of just telling me why this wouldn't be acceptable, she flies into a frenzy calling me a promiscuous slut for wanting to go to another man‚Äôs house that badly (my best friend is gay. she knows that), accuses me of wanting to kill her, and among other things threatens to throw my cat onto the street while I‚Äôm gone if I insist on going. My cat is almost 16 years old, has special needs, and she knows he would almost certainly die if she did this.

She starts screaming and sobbing and runs downstairs to cry to my father.

It‚Äôs been a week since then, and the argument hasn‚Äôt been spoken about since. We‚Äôve kind of just reverted back to normalcy.

One sister has an older dog, which is her emotional support animal. My fiance and I started planning our wedding last year and said from the beginning that her dog wouldn't be able to attend, the reason being that there are several people on both sides heavily allergic to dogs and the dog sheds a lot. She replied with ""well then I guess I'm not invited either!"" and then proceeded to talk badly about me to my mother about not allowing her dog to come, which I overheard. Because of this statement, as well as various other statements made by her (""Well I hope you'll take lots of pictures because I will not be there"") and my mom (insisting I change my mind), I did not ask her to be in my bridal party since I was acting on the assumption she is a potential no-show to the wedding. 
Later, she asked if they (her dog and her) would be allowed to come when I try on dresses). I said no, because it was going to be a small thing, and she huffed at that. 
I know it sounds selfish, and I am really trying to please everyone. My real problem is that even if we ignored the allergies, our venue has strict stipulations for pets on the premises and she isn't the best handler. When I've gone into stores with her and her dog, she lets the dog loose, not on a leash and wanders away to just waits for her (dog) to find her (sister). She also Barbara-like complains constantly about how people look at her dog (yes, just looking at the dog) and how because she has anxiety and a dog, she should be treated differently with special treatment.

Edit: Thank you all so much! This might have sounded kinda silly, but it's been weighing heavily since we got engaged. I can't reply to comments anymore so I guess that means my post ran through its time? As far as I know her dog is a glorified ESA. She does call her a service dog, but that's simply to be able to take her everywhere without questions.

I‚Äôve not asked them for a penny towards my wedding since I feel it‚Äôs unfair. All I expect is they buy the outfits (my priority was making sure they were happy while it was something I felt fit), and buy their own tickets to Greece. The rest of the party and guests had this. Most of the important relatives could make it, and most of my friends could. Everyone I spoke to was more excited to have a vacation honestly.

So when I spoke to my parents, they said they wanted me to pay for these tickets. I declined. There was too much money spent on the event and I couldn‚Äôt afford to pay anymore towards costs like these. I offered they go to my grandparents since they had a lot of savings. They weren‚Äôt going to attend the wedding since they didn‚Äôt want to attend such a westernised wedding. I believed (with their salary) they would save up more than enough to actually get the plane tickets for the four of them. They said they‚Äôd started spending money on renovations and extensions of the house just a few months prior, hence why they didn‚Äôt have enough.

I didn‚Äôt feel like this was a good enough reason so simply said unless they can get the money on their own, they won‚Äôt be able to attend the wedding. They feel like I should pay for their flight and ticket even if they could pay.

AITA?

Edit: me and H are from England. My grandparents are from Asia.

Edit: I used the word ‚Äúexpect‚Äù as they offered money towards the wedding in more parts before, so if they wanted to attend, I simply expected them to have enough money, which it appears they don‚Äôt.

If they can‚Äôt attend the wedding, I will feel upset, however it‚Äôs nothing that can be done. Accept and move on. It‚Äôs more a case of they feel I owe them the money and refuse to pay is where I am torn here.

625,AITA for not wanting to wear my engagement ring due to Sensory issues and Health Issues,56,Not the A-hole,54,hrp0m3,1594853681.0,"Me and my fiance have been together for about 9 years now, and been engaged for 4. 

I have Asperger's and I get sensory issues about things on my hands, and with my nerve problems due to as-yet diagnosed \[probably MS\] neurological problems, I find it stressful and sometimes painful to wear the ring. 

I've suggested wearing it on a necklace, so I can still wear it, but he says that defeat the point of the ring, and isn't an engagement ring at that point. So at this point, I only wear it on dates \[which was rare before the pandemic\], and special occasion. 

He seems to bring it up as a problem whenever we have an argument, along with the tattoo we share \[of polyhedral dice\] that blew out a little bit, and so i added to it a little bit, to make me love the tattoo more.. but he accuses me of covering it up. 

I know he has problems accepting my asperger's, because he wants to treat me like a ""normal"" person. Despite the problem with me having problems with body language, etc. I can mimic neurotypical people so what, but I do have a few problems that are just hard wired into my brain.

626,WIBTA if i asked my cousin not to name his son my given name?,46,Asshole,68,hrctsf,1594799181.0,"My cousin is expecting their second baby. I just heard they are thinking about naming him my given name, which also happens to be our grandpa's name(that is why they want to name him that way), if he ends up being a boy. I don't have an issue sharing a name with someone else, in fact I have gone by my middle name since I was very young so it wouldn't really affect me that way at all. The issue comes from the fact that the name in question was passed on from my grandpa to my dad and then to me, and to carry on that tradition I was also going to name my first boy the same. This is common knowledge in my family, so my cousin is very aware of this. 
I don't want to sound entitled at all, but honestly it's a bummer to me because I feel that part of this little tradition will be taken away in a sense. I understand that I could also name my son the same name and no one would probably think anything of it, but part of me is bugged that he wouldn't consider that in his choice of name. But I also see how I can't claim a name for myself and keep others from naming their children how they want, especially because he has every right to name his son after his grandpa that he obviously loves very much. 
So what do you guys say, WIBTA if I asked him to consider other names?

Edit: After the overwhelming response of YTA I think that seems to be the consensus and that is what I have accepted as the answer. If you want to continue and add your input go on ahead, I did just want to clarify a few things that seem to be misinterpreted by some from my story.

1) The baby is not born yet, I am not asking them to rename their baby, nor have they come out and said for sure their baby will have that name, rather they gave a small list of names they like and that name was at the top of their list. I would never ask someone to rename their baby after they have been named, post or pre birth.

2) I would never approach him and demand that he change his mind. I was going to just talk to him about it, we are pretty close so talking to each other about something thats bothering us wouldnt be totally out of left field. I would be prepared to accept no as an answer.

3) I have mentioned it in the comments, but people are wondering why this would bother me so much. In my family we go out of the way to not double up on names. When someone has a baby and they name that baby, everyone that might have had that name on their list crosses it off. So there is a part of me that feels like I couldn't also name my baby the same without getting beef from my family. That is of course just me speculating about the situation, there is no evidence to suggest that they would actually get mad at me if I named my future baby the same, but I am worried that it would.

4) I am married and my wife and I have been trying for a few months. We just experienced the loss of her pregnancy last week, and if the baby had ended up being a boy we planned to name him as discussed in this subreddit. My cousin of course did not know that, I am not claiming he is doing this in any malicious manner. Just more background because people seem to think I am not currently in a situation to have kids and I am attempting to placehold a name before I am actually married/ready for kids. We plan on having many kids, so the odds of us having a boy are high(but definitely not for sure) 

None of this is meant to sway people in one direction or the other. I am just addressing some of the questions people have asked, as well as some of the misconceptions people seem to be getting from my original post. I am not mad at my cousin, i was just wondering if IWBTA if I tried to talk to him about it.",False,1594828711.0,2020-07-15 00:46:21

A year ago my husband and I moved about 8 hours away so I have not seen Sara in a year, so she drove out here with her bf to stay for the weekend. (We quarantined before & after this trip).

&#x200B;

I adopted a GSD mix from the pound 5 years ago. I never had any issues with other dogs until he got attacked by 2 boxers at a dog park. Since then he does not get along with other dogs.

&#x200B;

The last night Sara and her bf were here, my husband and I left for 10 minutes to pick up dinner. Throughout their stay here, I‚Äôve always told them to keep the door shut when coming in and out of the house and they have. It was no issue, more of a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being overly cautious so just remember to shut the door!‚Äù Sort of thing. We were gone for 10 minutes and they let my dog out. They left the front door open. My dog got out and attacked a small dog. Apparently my dog grabbed the chihuahua and shook him. My friends split it up I guess.

&#x200B;

I about died inside and immediately freaked out. I talked to the girl walking the dog and she said the dog was fine but not even 20 minutes later an older man is knocking at my door irate because their dog is injured and they have to take him to the vet. He is understandably upset but this grown man is screaming at us while my friends are just sitting in the background not a care in the world. I hate to be dramatic but this man was so angry I sincerely thought he was going to attack us. We took responsibility and said we would pay all expenses no problem but NOTHING we could say helped. He was pissed. And I understand that because I would be too. After he left I was shaking and crying and Sara said she would pay the bill.

&#x200B;

Sara & her bf head back [home.Today](https://home.Today) the owner comes back to my home with a $2,000 vet bill. He was very aggressive & threatening even though we were cooperative so I was terrified. The dog ended up being okay & we drained our bank account to pay it bc I was so scared & once we did the man changed his tune and was nicer to us.

&#x200B;

I sent the bill to Sara. She offered to pay as much as she could but now she hasn‚Äôt been replying to me. Even if we had put our dog in the kennel one of our cats could have gotten out and gotten hit by a car or something. This whole issue changed my view of Sara and what was once ‚Äúoh she‚Äôs just a loveable idiot‚Äù has turned into ‚Äúthis friendship could potentially ruin my life‚Äù and I feel sick. I feel so stupid. In what world do people leave doors wide open. They tried to tell me the cats must‚Äôve opened the front door which is literally impossible. She is irresponsible with money but she just won several grand from some challenge or something last month but she blew through most of it already. She said she could maybe help me next month when she gets like $1000 from her parents.

They're great and I love them. I only saw my mother like 3 times in my life. She was already married but had an affair from which I was born. She and her husband decided they didn't want to deal with me and just kinda pretended I was never born, so they gave me to my uncle (who legally adopted me) and live kilometres far from me in a bigger city. I had always known she had other children (my half-sibilings) with her husband - for reference, S(12F), A(10F), Z(9F) and H(3M) - but never got to meet them, which didn't bother me. But the other day my uncle announced me my mother was coming with my half-sibs to ""spend the holidays here and let them meet their grandma"". Not me, not my uncle. Their grandma. It was fine I guess. I never liked my mother and always kinda had to deal with abandonment issues (but always having uncle and grandma by my side I felt comforted, loved, etc) and had no interest in meeting my siblings. Plus they never came here, as I said it was like they pretended I never existed, so both me and my uncle think she may have had a big fight with her husband but that's not our business. Anyway, it was fine. I thought it was gonna be a little awkward, and found myself pretty agitated whilst I waited for them to come. When they arrived (mother and 4 children, no husband), we chatted a bit. How are you and how was the trip stuff. I was looking at my sibs, who all really look alike and I'm nothing like them, until A asked me what my name was. I said ""I'm [my name] and you're A, am I right?"". She said I was and looked amazed, like if I wasn't supposed to know her name. Weird. Then my mother told the girls (the boy is too young to understand but was there too) that I was their cousin. I was shocked. Wtf, they didn't even know they had a brother? After a few seconds silent (uncle and grandma were staring at the scene not knowing what to do), I said something along the lines of ""Hell no, kid, I'm your brother, half-brother actually"". 
The kids were surprised and didn't know if they were supposed to believe me. Mother told them it was a prank, I'm her cousin. I kept insisting I was not, and my grandma was confirming. After like 5 mins of this my mother exploded. She started yelling at me and at my grandma for the ""bullshit"" we were saying, lying to her kids. She said she didn't want to hear me talking again. At this point I was furious, a woman I have seen 3 times in my whole life is now telling me I should stay silent in my own home. I ended up not having dinner, and going out hearing her cry along with Z and H.

He was super controlling, rude, fake. He basically pretended to be an angel and treated my mom and I like shit. I left and every time my mom would call me crying and all the drama. They did therapy, pastor counseling, everything but then got divorced last year and she moved to other state.

In these 5 years I turned my life around, enrolled in medical school, became a Christian missionary, stayed sober, met my husband (29m) and I'm currently pregnant with our first child. We live comfortably and I honestly came to love my life after all those years of addiction and being lost. During quarantine we got my mom living with us and supported her financially just to have her safe, (we live in the other side of the country btw) and during the lockdown she started talking with her ex again. he even visited, and stuff and I kept my mouth shut because my pregnancy was being hard enough and didn't want to stress more than I was.

Now that the quarantine is over, she tells me he proposed to her again and that he has changed, that he wants to be with him again. And since we got pregnant my husband and I have been really careful with the people we allow and not in our lives since we both had really dysfunctional and abusive families/family environments. We've been cutting people off for a long time (his family disowned us basically) but after the baby I'm like my son won't go through that kind of situations like me.

Anyways I told her if she wants to be with him again, good for her but he's not welcome in my house or my son's life. She said that if he's not welcome that means she's not welcome either and I told her that that was her decision. Something important to know is that we live pretty far away and that when she visits she stays in one of our guest rooms, and I'm not going to be a new mom with an newborn and uncomfortable in my own house, that'd mean too that if she wants to come for holidays he's not invited.

She says I hate him, and that I MUST forgive him and I'm a christian and I'm pretty familiar with the forgiveness concept but she can't force me to have someone in my life and force a step-grandpa in my son to a person that was extremely mean to me for a long time. Plus, he always tries to sabotage my relationship with my mom because he knows I don't like him.

This is petty and a small argument but I am butthurt nonetheless. 

Growing up, I (17F) got a lot of unsolicited comments about my hair. I am as white as can be, but I have wavy and thin brown hair- and it‚Äôs kind of a weird combination of genetics. This means my hair has the tendency to look messy no matter what I do with it. Furthermore, I didn‚Äôt learn how to take care of my own hair until I was almost seventeen. My mom never attempted to learn about my hair type or help me take care of it as a kid. She has very straight hair, and her idea of hair care is shampooing every day, conditioning, and then blow drying. It does not work for me. 

After I got my hair situation under control and was able to really understand and nurture my hair- I started to harness the individuality of it. I ended up dying the front parts half pink and half green. It isn‚Äôt the most attractive, but it genuinely makes me happy and confident in myself. Apart from that, I started dressing more punk-ish I guess and started doing my makeup ‚Äòunconventionally‚Äô. It‚Äôs not groundbreaking but I like it.

My senior picture is coming up and my mom isn‚Äôt too thrilled with my hair. She was semi supportive when I first dyed it, and never really mentioned it until we were in the store and I was going to buy some hair dye (with my own money) and she exclaimed ‚Äúno!‚Äù In an absolutely disgusted tone. So I put it back and didn‚Äôt say anything and we left. In the car she explained that she doesn‚Äôt want me to have dyed hair for my senior picture. My feelings just got really hurt. 

In the picture, all the girls wear the same dress and the photos are almost all the same- which is fine! I‚Äôll be doing the same thing but with colorful hair! I don‚Äôt see the issue. It‚Äôs my photo, my personality, and my life. And if I come to cringe at it in a few years- that‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs like the whole point of highschool. 

I don‚Äôt know who she‚Äôs trying to impress, because success is through internal work- not external perception. I have good grades, in honors and AP courses, and on track to go to college and major in pre-vet. It just feels like she‚Äôs embarrassed of me.

His parents have a sharpei, Skooshie, who is 14 years old (4 to 5 years past his breed's life expectancy). Personally, I feel that the sharpei gets very little love. Because of his health problems, there are fewer and fewer things he can do to have fun and just be a dog. Skooshie can't run or play much because of his arthritis and his hearing is totally shot, so he can't really hear when you praise him. His fatal flaw though is that he eats so fast he sometimes chokes.

The family's solution is to essentially feed him his kibble like cereal: soaked in copious amounts of water. They refuse to feed him anything else because they're worried he will get fat or have an allergic reaction (he has a soy allergy). I feel really bad for him since nobody in the house makes any effort to provide him with any kind of mental stimulation, so I've taken it upon myself.

Even the mechanical pencils were nice, filled with led and had eraser caps over untouched replaceable erasers (you know how you can take the eraser off to fill them).

I came home the other day from a long shift at work to find it nearly empty. All that was left was a sharpie and a green pen (which wasn't even in the cup, it was on my desk). Which means I also don't have my red or blue ones that were there, along with two highlighters.
My dad is great at borrowing them, he ALWAYS returns them, only taking one at a time here and there.
A lot has been going on (I got in a car crash, having to help people move) so I only just got around to confronting my mom. She said that they're somewhere in the house, and there's a box of scissors (surprising to say the least since she always loses those too, that's why I had my own pair that was bought in middle school) and a bag of pens/pencils in one of the rooms. She said I shouldn't be upset since she bought them for me anyways (if you gift something it's not yours anymore) and that the ones in the bag should be fine. Most of the pens in there didn't even work, and even if they did, they aren't what I need (again they apply differently, and as an artist that matters). All the pencils in there were either broken mechanicals or wooden ones, which I haven't used wooden since like second grade.
Some of the pens were genuinely special, being gifted from friends and I have 0 idea what brand they actually are (like I had this plastic feather one that was my favourite), and my mom just ... Lost them. At least 10 writing utensils. In one day.
I told her that she will need to buy me new ones since she took them from my room without even telling me and with no regard for putting them back. She said it doesn't matter, she bought them anyways (which.. isn't true) and I shouldn't be upset for her using things in ""her house""",False,False,2020-07-13 17:44:14
639,AITA for intentionally avoiding GM by making plans with friends whenever she comes over?,46,Not the A-hole,26,hq8ay1,1594641209.0,"Long time lurker, first time posting anything on Reddit. On mobile, sorry if the formatting is weird. This is a long one.

Background: My GM (65) is my Mom‚Äôs (43) mother. GM has always been a very mean person to put it lightly. Ever since my Mom was a kid, GM would constantly gaslight and manipulate her. For example, when my Mom was engaged to my Dad (46), GM was strongly against it and claimed that my Dad was brainwashing my Mom (which he wasn‚Äôt). They ended up getting married, and GM has gotten over it, but she is still that same abusive person. 

When I (16f) was born, GM found a new target. Whenever we would visit her, GM would criticize me, and would often say things leaving me in a negative mental state (I‚Äôd be more specific but I don‚Äôt want to go past the character limit). GM would also gaslight my Mom, claiming that she wasn‚Äôt raising me right. My Mom would then get frustrated with me, which significantly damaged my self image and mental health. Long story short, I ended up with really bad depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder. I know I can‚Äôt blame everything on GM, but she did contribute to a lot of my mental health issues. Even then, GM blamed my poor mental health on my Mom, which caused a big rift in my relationship with her. My Mom and I have a better relationship now, but GM is always a sore point for us. 

My parents are very aware of the problems with GM, and they‚Äôve tried their best to protect me from her. The issue is that despite my parents being aware of the way GM is, they refuse to cut her off. I know it‚Äôs a lot to ask my Mom to cut off GM, considering GM raised her and is her own mom. But GM has done nothing to make up for what she did to my Mom and I. My Dad hates GM, but he still supports my Mom when it comes to maintaining a relationship with GM.

Here‚Äôs where I may be the AH: GM likes to come over every Wednesday to drop off food and hang out. I hate being alone with her, especially when my parents aren‚Äôt around because she continues saying hurtful and manipulative things. As a solution, I‚Äôve been hanging out with my friends on Wednesdays as a way to internationally avoid GM (Covid restrictions are lifting in my area and my friends and I agreed to only interact with each other, and our families). My parents think that I‚Äôm the AH for avoiding GM and not dealing with her, but my friends and therapist (who is very aware of the situation) say other wise.

So Reddit, AITAH for intentionality avoiding GM?

EDIT: No one really asked, but I also want to say that I‚Äôm not just using my friends to avoid GM. They‚Äôre like a second family to me and I‚Äôd never use them just so I can avoid GM.",False,1594651012.0,2020-07-13 04:53:29

641,AITA for kicking my sister out of my BF and I's house?,40,Not the A-hole,34,hoyg95,1594448205.0,"So some backstory of this. I work in at a job that sometimes forces me to go across the nation for about a month to 5 months. I have a boyfriend (Kai) that I'm going to propose to soon, and my sister and her daughter live in our house since she has nowhere to go right now since her boyfriend getting a house for them and she can't stay in his apartment. She asked me if she could stay while her boyfriend goes house hunting. of course I said yes until they find a house. Another thing to note is that Kai is FTM transgender. Very important for later.

I recently have been sent across the nation again for a business conference. Me and Kai have been face timing every night, more for his comfort as I don't mind. He built a pillow/blanket fort to help distract himself from his dismorphia and I could tell since he was laying in one. He told me that his surgery had to be pushed back due to the virus, and he felt bad. I told him to he'll make it. He also told me that my sister had made fun of him because he's trans. I told him she like to make fun to order to make friend with you and I also said I'll talk to her about it and tell her to joke about something else. I stayed on until he fell asleep and I would contact my sister in the morning.

I did, and she said that it was hard to make fun of him because he kept to himself and that's the one thing she can make puns or jokes out of. I told her that it doesn't help him and in fact hurts him and that's why he hides in our room. She said she'd stop. She didn't In fact she upped it to the point Kai walked out one day and went to his parents after locking certain rooms, (our room, and his ""office"") I was coming home that day and was confused when I couldn't find him, he wouldn't answer his phone and wouldn't answer my text. I asked my sister what happened and she said she only made one joke to him which then he locked the rooms and left. I asked what joke was it?

I kid you not it was ""Man I thought you would handle my jokes like a man but you still have your pussy so I guess your emotions are still there."" I'm actually surprised that Kai didn't murder her right there and thrown out her corpse. I told her to get the fuck out and never come back, she tried to guilt me that her daughter couldn't live in the streets and I told her that her kid can stay but not her. I made her get her clothes and all the stuff she would need and left to go to her BF's place, I told the daughter that her mom did something wrong and was being punished for it. She understood and told me she asked her mommy to stop with the jokes since she saw how uncomfortable she made my Kai.

Her Boyfriend said I was an asshole for kicking her out, but she disrespected my rule and made Kai run off.

PS: before you say Kai could've told her to knock it off, he did, it failed and that's why he asked me to do it.

642,AITA for asking a friend of mine to leave the bridal party over hair color?,56,Not the A-hole,75,hrtwzd,1594869145.0,"This happened last year, but I still think about it rather frequently and wonder if I was in the wrong.

I got married last summer and had asked a girl (Sally) if she would be a bridesmaid. Sally and I have been friends for years, throughout high school and college, though Sally has an attention-seeking tendency. 

Two days before my wedding, I noticed she posted a picture on instagram. She had dyed her hair bright green. Like, neon green. I really don't care about the hair- if she likes it, good for her. But I felt like the timing was a little bit disrespectful. She's never changed her hair color prior to now, but decided to right before my wedding. 

When I reached out to her and told her I didn't really want her to have bright green hair in the pictures, she was like ""Oh that's okay, I just won't go then."" She missed my wedding. It was hurtful to me that she was so nonchalant about it, but also hurtful that she didn't wait like, three more days to experiment with her hair. But maybe I'm a jerk for even having it bother me?

&#x200B;

I'm (34 F) 3 months post partum with a baby boy (best and cutest baby in the known universe - excuse typos, he's nestled under my writing arm). I had a super rough pregnancy, nauseus and fatigued the whole way through. My partner ""Sam"" (32 M) and I have been together about 4 years, and he is amazing; kind, intelligent, very witty, very generous and supportive. He took wonderful care of me while I was pregnant, cooking, cleaning, back rubs, and he's a doting dad. 

&#x200B;

However, I've been feeling better after my pregnancy and ready to start running again. I mentioned to Sam that I want to buy a jogging stroller (2nd hand, around 150 bucks) and he said no. I was pretty shocked, we have a very equal partnership, and this is a bit out of character.  

&#x200B;

He thinks we have too much stuff and I should be able to 'spend time away from bubba'. He thinks that I should organise my runs around his work schedule.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I don't want to be restricted to his schedule! I want to be able to run when I want. He said I should just be more organised, and run when he's at home. But when he's at home is the time I have to clean the house, have a shower, rest, do yoga, cook, and talk to friends. He thinks because he's only working 3 or 4 days of the week (cause of the rona - still getting paid full time) , I should be able to organise my runs around this. We do already have a pram, but it was a hand-me-down, so we didn't spend any money on it.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm honestly really upset. This is not a financial issue, I'm on paid maternity leave and we have good savings. He also does a reasonably expensive sport 3 times a week, and just bought some sporting equipment for another sport he does, which cost ($150). He also goes out with friends at least once or twice a week, but I really need the time for myself when I run. Otherwise I'm stuck with the baby all day.

It affected me badly. I basically told him he was an AH, and that was a shitty thing to say. It was as if he found me working hard to be better off financially some sort of a joke. I stopped talking to him, but had a panic attack right after.

I'm stuck in his high standard of car safety, because I wan't a car now and I'm FULLY WILLING to work my ass off and pay for a car that I want myself and get it NOW, but he wants me in a really safe car that we can't afford now, and is forcing me to wait so he can get me what he thinks is safe.

He's had 3 friends die in car accidents. All of the accidents were driver error: an SUV not paying attention and driving over a guard rail and off of a bridge, a girl getting launched out of a roofless jeep because she wasn't wearing a seatbelt, and I don't remember the third one.

Would I be an asshole trying to prove why his logic is unreasonable? I've had arguments with him but I'm tired of him dictating what I can do with my money because of his own fears.",False,False,2020-07-14 10:14:42
655,AITA for insisting that my wife won‚Äôt stand up for herself about her pay?,38,Asshole,71,hqfugv,1594677946.0,"So my wife works at a private children‚Äôs home, and is a ‚Äúfull time‚Äù employee, however, she is paid hourly, not salary. At her employer, full time is considered 50 hours. In my state, hourly employees who work over 40 hours a week must be paid time and a half on the hours over 40, however, my wife‚Äôs employer says that full time there is 50 hours, and you only get paid for overtime for hours over 50. I think this is kinda ridiculous; the company doesn‚Äôt get to determine whether the law applies to them. And I think people turn a blind eye because it‚Äôs a children‚Äôs home.

I told my wife she should speak up about it; she‚Äôs missing out on $100 weekly that she legally deserves, which comes out to a $5k increase annually (which would be the equivalent of a 10% raise). She doesn‚Äôt want to speak up though because she is newer (4 months) and no one else does, so she doesn‚Äôt want to be the new person who comes in and starts complaining about the way things are. But this is money we could really use right now.

Lately she‚Äôs told me that what she makes at work isn‚Äôt my business and that I should let it go. I feel like this isn‚Äôt true because we share finances. I have tried to see if she is having an issue with a manager or something that makes her not want to stand up for herself, but it doesn‚Äôt seem that is the case. AITA?

656,WIBTA for making my sisters share a room?,42,No A-holes here,30,hqak9w,1594652161.0,"Backstory: I‚Äôm (f19) the oldest of five siblings. I live in a household with two parents, two siblings (not including myself), and two cousins. I‚Äôm nineteen and I moved back home from college this march because of the COVID situation. After I left for college, my two cousins took over my room. I was fine with this as long as I‚Äôd get to have it over major breaks such as Summer and Winter. When I came back for Winter break I decided to stay in my sister's (13) Sarah‚Äôs room. It was fine for the time and I didn‚Äôt mind it. I decided then that I would be fine with sharing with her instead of getting back my own room and she was fine with it too.

Fast forward to Spring break I was told that I‚Äôd have to remove all my belongings from the dorm and come back home. Sarah and I both had to give up things in order to keep everything organized in the room. We share a queen size bed so nothing really feels divided. It wasn‚Äôt bad in the beginning because I was used to sharing a room in college. As time went on I started craving privacy and along with that, I decided to transfer to a university in my hometown so I‚Äôd be staying at home until at least graduation (2023). 

For the past month or so I‚Äôve really been wanting my own room. She hasn‚Äôt done anything to aggravate me or anything I feel like I am just in a completely different part of my life than she is. I work full time (2 pm to 11 pm) almost every day and I‚Äôm taking college classes. So I am on a totally different schedule than she is. 

There is a possibility of me getting my own space, my youngest sister, Taylor (8) lives in the study that we have converted into a room for her. That‚Äôs been her room since birth and she has at least a thousand toys in there. She‚Äôs getting to the age where she‚Äôs starting to grow out of it. My dad has jokingly offered me her room a few times. I asked my mother in the past if she would be open to us getting bunk beds or two twins so that it feels like some sort of separation but she said no and that if I really wanted it I would have to pay for both by myself. Also to note I can‚Äôt take back my old room that my cousins currently share. So taking Taylor‚Äôs room is my only reasonable option.

I‚Äôm just worried that my selfishness will cause issues in the family. Sarah absolutely does not want to room with Taylor and Taylor will be devastated that she has to get rid of most of her toys. They really don‚Äôt get along and it might cause even more issues. I know this will cause both of my sisters to resent me. Right now the living situation is not too bad for me but I know as time progresses I‚Äôll start getting more irritated by it. Another thing to note, I plan on moving out sometime next year but I think that‚Äôs a substantial time away especially now that we're all home. 

So would I be the asshole for forcing my sisters to share a room against their will just because I feel like I need space, or is my point valid?

Two days after it happened, I had to go to her house to grab some of my childhood things. Because we weren't alone, she was acting like nothing happened and was being overly friendly. That made me realize the cycle that is our relationship. She gets pissy for no reason, blames it on me, freezes me out for a bit, then moves on like nothing happened. I can't deal with that anymore. I feel like I am better off with a $-200 balance in my bank account than begging her for the money back. As of right now, my mother is not going to be in my life unless it is absolutely necessary. As for those of you that are telling me to take legal action, I have literally no money. COVID fucked me over good, so I have nothing. I can't afford my rent, let alone legal fees and court costs. But i thank you for your advice. All of you. I appreciate. 

Basically, as the title says. I was in a relationship with a guy who had control of my finances. In February of 2018, my mom wanted to buy a house but couldn't afford to do so. So my, now ex, boyfriend gave her 500$, took 1,000$ from my 2018 tax return (the entire thing) and gave all of that to her to buy a house. I had no knowledge of this until I asked him for the money because I had already made plans for it. The money was gone, oh well, mom will pay me back, right? Well, after many arguements and shunnings later, I finally get payments of $25/month in July of 2019, over a year after the money was taken. Fine, whatever, at least i am getting it back. Flashforward to last night, July 9, 2020. They have only paid $315 of the $1,000. Since it had been more that 2 years at this point, it is now Covid time, I have no money and my mom has made it very obvious that she does, I asked her if she could start paying more towards it. This was over the phone and she started screaming at me, so i hung up on her. After i hung up, she sent me a very nasty text about how i treat her like shit and don't love her and she doesn't trust me anymore. She is also posting very passive aggressive things on Facebook.

659,AITA for agreeing to be a maid of honor and then backing out?,41,No A-holes here,20,hogibs,1594375946.0,"This happened a couple years ago, but it‚Äôs something I find myself thinking about from time to time. 

I was good friends with a girl, Amy, in high school. After high school we went to the same college, and we remained friends throughout the first year. During our second year, Amy met a new boyfriend. Amy was always the kind of girl that would ditch her friends for whoever she was dating, and this was no different. After she met her boyfriend I barely saw her. While this bothered me in high school, by this point I was used to it and had made other friends. Amy and I drifted apart and pretty much stopped talking. 

After college I moved away for graduate school. I moved back home after graduation and Amy and I reconnected. At this point we hadn‚Äôt spoken beyond a casual social media ‚Äúhappy holidays hope all is well‚Äù in about 5 years. She asked me to grab lunch with her one afternoon, and I accepted. At lunch, she told me that her boyfriend (the same one she met while we were in college) had proposed. She then asked me to be her maid of honor. I was shocked. We had barely spoken in 5 years. But I said yes. I absolutely shouldn‚Äôt have said yes, but I was so taken aback I didn‚Äôt know what to do. 

I should mention that at this point in my life, I had been applying to PhD programs. A few weeks after accepting the maid of honor offer, I found out I was accepted into a PhD program, starting in a few months (before the wedding). The program was halfway across the country and intensive. I called Amy and told her that because I would be moving and starting this program, I didn‚Äôt think it would be right for me to serve as maid of honor. Amy sounded hurt, but said she understood. 

I still feel terribly about it. While everything I said about the PhD program was true, the real reason I bailed was because I felt uncomfortable. I had never even met her fianc√©. I didn‚Äôt know anyone else in the bridal party. I felt very under qualified to fill this huge role.

I didn't care about that at all, but then they came back and were using the electrical box thing on my front lawn to play hide and seek or tag or something. 

Then one of them, the older one, moved to our driveway and started using my car as a hiding spot. I was a bit shocked because I've never seen kids do that before. So, from my balcony, I said in a kind (but stern) tone: 'hey, can you please stop touching my car.' The kid looked up and nervously said sorry but then she didn't move! So then I said, 'you need to move' and she ran away. 

When she ran away I felt so bad because I fear that I scared them! I didn't use an inappropriate tone, but maybe I should have used different words?

Background info: I've never seen these kids before, but we live in a semi-gated community so they most likely live in the neighbourhood or are visiting somebody who does. I don't know their ages. The older girl looked between 11 and 13 and the younger one looked to be about 6 or so. All my interaction was with the older girl as the younger one did not come to the driveway and seemed to realize that it was dangerous to play around the electrical box (she said so to the older girl).

My kids dont seem to mind not having phones. They rarely bring it up, maybe 1-2 times a year? They have casually mentioned that ALL of their peers have had smart phones since like 2nd-3rd grade. Which I thought was kind of crazy. 

We have been trying to let them have as genuine if a childhood as possible and be unplugged. We also don‚Äôt do video games/computers (for the kids, my husband and I have laptops that we occasionally use) at home and limit tv time. They play with their toys and are super into LPS and pretend play. Their imaginations are great and they have a lot of fun together.

I (30F) share a three story townhouse with several roommates. Because I am the legal tenant on the lease I feel entitled to the mater bedroom and bathroom. I pay double-rent for this privilege. My bathroom is the only one in-house with a bathtub. The other three bathrooms just have showers, not tubs.

One of our roommates, ""Annie"", to be perfect frank, has a horrible personality. She's very entitled and pompous. She moved in to my home as a renter after her parents refused to allow her to live with them rent-free and do nothing but party and sleep. Annie has a little sister, ""Bella"", 18, who is basically a younger version of Annie. Annie has a horrible personality and she's been rude to the other housemates, but she pays all her bills on time so the housemates voted to let her stay so I haven't kicked her out. We recently discovered that Annie snuck Bella into live in our house without telling anyone. Bella has been using our hot water, our Wi-Fi, and eating our food, without reimbursement. When we discovered her Annie seemed to think she was entitled to allow Bella to live with us. At first Annie refused to pay for Bella but after we threatened to evict her Bella got a two-day a week job and helps with bills. I recently caught Bella in my closet trying to ""borrow"" my clothes and subsequently put an electronic lock on my bedroom door.

The other day I was chilling in my room after work when Bella started pounding on my door demanding to use my bathroom as all the other bathrooms were occupied. I refused to let her in. Later on Annie called a house-meeting and accused me of rudeness over refusing to let Bella use my bathroom. Apparently Bella has fallen at work and screwed up her back and wanted to soak in my tub. I defending myself with the fact that I pay more rent than everyone else specifically so I have a private bathroom and Bella could have taken a hot shower and gotten the same results. I also pointed out that Bella has a thievery problem and I can't trust her in my bedroom.

Annie is, naturally, on Bella's side in thinking I'm an asshole. Our housemates, ""H"", ""K"", ""Y"" and ""C"" are split evenly. They all believe no one is entitled to my private bathroom but that I could have been a lot nicer to Bella since she was injured. They also think I'm being a little dramatic putting a lock on my door and have said it makes them feel like I don't trust any of them.

664,AITA for deleting the Messenger app from my phone?,37,Not the A-hole,19,hppg8v,1594562202.0,"In my locality, the most used platform for instant messaging is Facebook Messenger. For the past two or three years during breaks and holidays, it's always been a practice of mine to delete the app (plus other apps like Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook itself) from my phone and avoid going to Messenger because I've find myself constantly agitated by the app, always anxious whether there's a new message in my inbox thus leading me into a cycle of opening the app at least two to five times within an hour. 

So I deleted it, and it helps. It's summer break now, and the app has been off my phone for almost a month. 

Now, my close family (parents, siblings) and I have a groupchat on Messenger. This is where we send links, videos, and pictures of memories and whatever else we find cool to share. Just earlier, my mom told me that she sent me something on Messenger that I should see (private message, I think). Apparently, until this moment, neither of my parents knew that I deleted Messenger. They weren't furious, but I could tell they were kind of mad at me because, all the while they were sending whatever they were sending in the past month, I was not there to see any of it.

Perhaps I can see I was wrong for not telling them I deleted Messenger beforehand. But I'm slightly offended by how they didn't try to understand my side of how apps like Messenger take a toll on my mental health, and that I'm doing it to quieten my mind. And since they're my family, I wasn't worried about not seeing the groupchat, because, hell, I see them irl every day. If they wanted to share something, I was just in the next room. 

People their age especially go around preaching how the kids of today are so engrossed in social media, yet here they are complaining when they find out their own kid decided to get back in touch with reality.

We have been together for just shy of 5 years. His mom seems to adore me but constantly brings up my pale complextion as the sole reason her son should reproduce with me.  

I am a teacher doing a lot of work to help the family with anything that involves written English (filling out forms, helping extended immigrated family with free tutoring ect), do a lot of free childcare for the family/ extended family and I'd like to think that I'm an overall good fit for her son.  

The turning point of all of this came when she moved in with us during quarinteen and constantly berated her son for his ""farmers tan"" that made him look ""low class"" (he works outside a lot as he is really into home improvement and gardening). She would follow up that when we have babies they hopefully would have my complextion and not look like ""simple farmers"". 

I got a little heated, calmly explaining to her I am far more than my complextion, as is my partner.  And IF we decide to ever reproduce (My partner and I are keen on being biological child free) we would adopt to get kids out of the system. I usually don't speak out against his mother but I really would hate to see any child of mine (biological or adopted) be seen as less than for the pigment of their skin.  

She was shocked and nearly started to cry at this revelation (we had spoken about adoption before but she had never taken us seriously) as every mother wants ""her own child"". So she'd always just brush it off.

My paychecks go there, my money from family goes there, my tax returns, roommate rent payments, everything. I carry a card with his name on it for purchases.

I work two jobs normally, but I'm furloughed from one until I can see my doctor to get a permission slip that indemnifies my workplace in case I get sick, since I have an autoimmune disease and limited immune response, so I'm just working one job and am considered ""high risk"" for illness. So my income is pretty limited right now. As such, my family have been helping out where they can, and so far to date they and I have paid my rent and added a solid $200 to the account. For my birthday I bought myself a coat, since my birthday is in spring and coats were on sale... Well, it didn't fit, so yesterday I returned it and bought summer clothes within the cost of the coat.

My partner gets a text message every time my card is used for an expenditure. I didn't know that until today. Today we had a big fight over my spending... Apparently I've spent too much in the last two months, not including the coat which was a few months ago. I pointed out that the money I spent yesterday was against the return of the coat, but I was confused what the rest was... They were ongoing payments like our Hulu and such. All of this is covered by the money I've been putting in the account, and to be fair I've put a lot less in lately than in past months, when I have two paychecks flowing into it.

So when he said I spent $50 yesterday, I was confused. I only made one purchase yesterday, so I checked... It was $25 of shorts and work clothes, after a $70 return of the coat. He said I spent $50 on Amazon, so I checked my email and I've spent $6.75.

Now, mind, he's right, I probably shouldn't be spending anything. But I don't eat out or order in, I don't go casually shopping, and lately I don't even leave the house for more than walks, so I'm confused... Our relationship has always had struggles with money.

We're moving incredibly slowly toward that goal, say 1k a month, so its will take FOREVER to save that.

Here's the problem - i HATE my job. Its dead end and not really what I want to do. I'm also really far from all my family who are back home, so feeling pretty shitty. What I do want to do requires a masters degree, but I can't get funding for it here as I'm not a citizen, meaning id have to pay upfront - about 30k. Essentially all our savings....  AITA for considering asking my partner if i can use it for a masters? I asked my partner if we can move back to my home country but he refuses until we have a house deposit. The other option is I could do part time and pay as I go, but meaning we won't save any more on top of that.

She would say: ‚Äòif you get me pregnant again, imma kill you‚Äô.  I ultimately agreed. One was enough for me and her. (At the time of conversation). As time went on, she has hinted that she would in fact like a second one if she were to get pregnant, and i still stood firm  with no more children. I told her i would get a vasectomy, but in a joking manner. To be truthful, we never really had that serious convo, but we did convey to each other of our stance. So anyway, about a month ago we have been having unprotected sex (i know üôÑ). And she‚Äôs been mentioning how she may be cramping like she‚Äôs pregnant. Now, there are a few factors going on as far as her not yet getting her period because of her just giving birth the months ago, the timing and stuff like that. So yesterday, she said she would go get a pregnancy test and i agreed. I told her we need to actually talk about what if she‚Äôs pregnant. I told her we can‚Äôt have two kids back to back like this. It‚Äôs financially irresponsible imo. And her rebuttal is: ‚Äòwe will be ok‚Äô. That‚Äôs not a good enough answer for me lol. Now let me give her some slack, shes not deliberately trying get pregnant or trap me or anything lie that. Her main point is, if she happens to get pregnant, she will welcome it. Me, on the other hand my goal is to avoid it forever. I already work two jobs to supplement one child. I dont know what else i would have to do with a second one. (Whew!). Anyway, she got mad at me for not wanting a second child. Shes being short with me and acting pissy. Last night,  she took a test and shes negative (thank god).

We haven‚Äôt been able to all be together lately, so during the pandemic, I have been keep in touch with my niece and nephews through FaceTime and sending them little letters in the mail throughout the week. My nephews have liked the FaceTime calls, but none of them have really cared about the letters. My 7yo niece however, has LOVED this and has been writing me back and sending me art projects and homemade gifts in the mail. 

Because my niece has responded so positively to these exchanges, I have been sending her letters more frequently and sending her little packages of homemade gifts as well (clothes I‚Äôve made for her dolls, little hand written books etc), based on what we have been discussing in our letters. She has been delighted and really engaged in these exchanges, while her brother and my other nephews have not really cared. During a family Zoom call last week, my oldest sister found out about my niece getting more mail than her sons, and she became extremely upset and told me I was picking favorites and it wasn‚Äôt fair to the other kids that I wasn‚Äôt sending them gifts also. My sister became so upset that she left the Zoom call and then sent me an angry text that basically told me that if I didn‚Äôt want to act like an aunt to her kids, then I didn‚Äôt need to be involved in their lives. 

I thought this was a bit extreme and that she would cool down, but she hasn‚Äôt talked to me since, and now my parents are backing her up saying I am not being fair. I asked my other siblings and received mixed reviews on the fairness of the situation. My niece has a brother and he has not felt slighted at all and my other nephews have no idea about any of it; but my oldest sister is adamant that I am picking favorites and giving special treatment. I have not stopped FaceTiming or writing to my other nephews, and have occasionally sent them packages with gifts; but none of them ever responded back or seemed to even care.

A very sensitive topic for me is my weight since I suffer from an eating disorder (binge eating) and I‚Äôm overweight. My mom has gone about this issue in a very wrong way, I feel, from taking me to dieticians since I was 9 years old, to forcing me to go the gym or I would not be allowed to hang with my friends and even making me do a gastric balloon surgery when I was 15 against my wishes. In her defense she does provide me with therapy appointments and has even gone to a few and listened to the therapist and tried to change. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs bad, just misguided. 

But onto the situation. Today after trying an old sweater that I couldn‚Äôt fit in anymore, she said to me ‚Äúwhy are you so fat? Why don‚Äôt you take care of yourself? Have you ever even thought about that?‚Äù Listen, I obviously thought of that, obviously I wish I wasn‚Äôt fat and struggling with an eating disorder and other mental health issues that aggravate it, but I didn‚Äôt want to say this since my mom has a tendency to use what I say against me later on. So I just said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù She insisted saying ‚Äúyou need to take care of yourself, I‚Äôm saying this because I‚Äôm your mom and I‚Äôm worried about your health.‚Äù I just said okay. She kept talking and I kept saying okay since I didn‚Äôt want to be in that conversation. After a while she caught on and asked if I wanted to be in this conversation and I said I didn‚Äôt. She said ‚Äúwell, too bad. I want an answer to why you‚Äôre fat and you don‚Äôt take care of yourself.‚Äù I was already feeling myself about to cry since this is a very sensitive subject to me so I just said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk to you about this, it‚Äôs a sensitive subject to me and you have a tendency to use this stuff against me later on so no, I will not talk.‚Äù 

Y‚Äôall, she lost her shit. Started saying how I thought I was superior and didn‚Äôt wanna talk to her, how I talked to this issues with my psychiatrist, who only cares because she‚Äôs paid, that I thought less of her and how dare I make her humiliate herself to ask me to answer a question. She was honestly so pressed she had to take her sweater in the middle lmao. 

I cried a lot but didn‚Äôt answer. She went away after a while and said she would not be paying my therapy anymore or giving me money, despite the fact that I can‚Äôt even work since I go to med school full time (also something she forced me to do, but I actually enjoy it, and that‚Äôs another story.)

So, was I the asshole for not engaging or am in the wrong? In the beginning I was sure I wasn‚Äôt wrong but the more I think about maybe if I just answered it she wouldn‚Äôt have blown up like this?

Right as I was finishing up someone came and tried to pull in. Shovel in hand, I stood in the spot and said I specifically shoveled this spot for our moving van, which was waiting around the corner.

What's your address?

I sent my address thinking maybe he and his wife wanted to drop by and visit since I live on the route they take to his brother's house, who lives about an hour north of me.

Next text is:

If I get a local route could I rent a room from you during the week?

I was pretty floored. My husband and I are childless, and we went through a few years of bad financial times, we were forced to move in with about 6 other people in a 3 bedroom and it was a nightmare. Now, we've come out the other side doing much better financially and we finally live on our own, all the roommates moved out one by one, and have converted the two extra rooms into offices and I work from home.

So, we have plenty of room to rent, but we are just not looking to have another roommate. We enjoy our space and are proud of what we've accomplished. My husband is absolutely against the idea of him moving in, not wanting to break up this quiet bliss we finally have and I respect that.

I'm feeling so guilty though, my family frequently let's anyone blood related stay whenever they ask, I've even lived with family members when I was 17 and 18 going to school. Like my guilt is so palpable I'm having stress dreams.

The problem is, my family is also incredibly dramatic. One of those family members I mentioned is the very brother of the person asking to move in. It was about 13 years ago and I was 17, since then he hasnt spoken to me and wont tell me why. Just that he hates me and I hurt his feelings. Apparently something I did when I was 17 and lived there? This has happened before with other members of my family living together as well and no one seems to see the pattern. It's like loaning a friend money, it tends to end in disappointment.

I'd also like to add that he and his wife own a house in my hometown and both make good money, he just wants to switch jobs to this area and work here during the week and go home on weekends. So I'm not making someone homeless, I would never do that. If family came to me in need of a place to live to escape a bad situation or homelessness that would be a completely different story.

He also gave no end date and no details with how long this would last and his wife has zero plans to move last I talked to her, so I guess this would be for forever?

I've been absolutely sick over this. I even tried to talk to my mom and all she said was ""wouldnt the extra money be nice?"" So I have a small inkling it may have been her idea in the first place.

Anyway, this is long enough.

TL:DR family member wants to rent a room from me during the week, husband and I dont want a roommate but I feel guilty saying no because he's family

Edit: sorry I forgot some details, he expects to be added to the lease as a permanent member of the household. I did have a bit more of a conversation with him than I mentioned

UPDATE: So I explained that after a terrible last roommate (he was so awful you guys, he broke a window, ripped the smoke alarm out of the ceiling, broke a washer and a dryer, peed on the toilet seat all the time, left loogies in the sink, I could go on forever) that we just wouldn't be able to accommodate another renter right now and I even ran it by my landlord as a ""what if"" we wanted to add another tenant and they were like yeah remember the  last person, and was really hesitant to even entertain the idea (understandably, we're lucky they didnt lump us in with the last bad roommate and not renew our lease tbh). 
Anyway, after explaining all that in a text I got back a, ""Thanks""

683,"WIBTA if I told my sister that what she interprets as ""interrupting"" her is people trying to get a word in edgewise while she dominates a conversation?",34,No A-holes here,21,hoz39g,1594450507.0,"I'm 25M, my younger sister is 22F (also have a younger brother 20M). She has autism, which is noticeable when you spend a decent amount of time with her and does inhibit her in certain ways but she's also fairly smart and currently in college. 

We get along pretty well but she can be exhausting to talk to sometimes. She has a hard time picking up on social cues so she will continue talking about something long after everyone else has stopped responding. She can't seem to tell when people are getting increasingly frustrated or annoyed with her until they eventually blow up. 

The past few months we've all been stuck at home together because of the pandemic (and because I had to move out of a shitty apartment situation on short notice) and I've noticed that she complains quite a lot about being interrupted, taking it very personally and being genuinely hurt whenever she's talked over. And I get it, being ignored sucks. Being interrupted is frustrating. But it's only happening with such frequency because she's at a table with 5 people and doing 80% of the talking, and other people can't find an opening to say anything. 

It's like every time she opens her mouth she wants to give an entire prepared presentation on whatever we're talking about. She has a lot of very strong opinions--most of which I agree with! But she gets so animated talking about them that she doesn't realize she's not letting anyone else contribute. It's especially frustrating when she's talking about something contentious like politics that other people don't want to talk about and she keeps saying ""I'm not done"" and ""Let me finish"" when people try to change the subject. 

She's not a mean or selfish person, she's enormously empathetic and sweet. But I think her autism is interfering with her ability to see how she's coming across. I'm afraid of hurting her feelings, she takes stuff like this very personally, but I feel like I have to say something because it keeps causing fights between her and my parents and honestly it's exhausting me too. Is there a non A-hole way to address this with her? 

TLDR: My sister can't pick up social cues bc of autism, gets very upset that people interrupt her but dominates conversations so it's the only way they can say anything. Is there a way to point this out to her without being an asshole?

**Edit: I texted her as gently as I could, explaining that I sometimes struggle to find a break in the conversation when I talk to her but know that interrupting is frustrating. I tried to focus on finding a solution that makes us both happy instead of assigning blame. We settled on me raising my hand when I want to say something so she'll know to wrap up the point she's making. I didn't specifically bring up that this applies to conversations between her and other people but she's smart and introspective and I feel like she will probably at least consider that this might be causing issues with other relationships.

Hello, I have been helping out my brother and my new sister law over the past month. I‚Äôve been helping them move and my wife and me have been watching my brothers new stepson. Me and my wife have done everything we can to accommodate them in this new transition in their lives. They‚Äôre younger (21 and 25) but are fully functional adults. I have let them borrow my truck, helped them move furniture and even been there for them when my brother had a really rough anxiety attack. 
 
Well today, they needed help picking up a sofa they had just bought. I told them that I could help but it would be later in the evening before I could, reason being my wife had errands to run and I had to watch our 3 kids at home. They were ok with this for the time being. Until they figured out the store would help them load the furniture on the truck. 

They proceeded to call me and tell me that they would need help unloading the truck. I told them fine, as long as it‚Äôs later in the evening and everything that we had planned to do was taken care of. Then a few minutes later the sister in law calls back but it‚Äôs her son, he precedes to ask if I can watch him. He‚Äôs (6) and doesn‚Äôt play well with my kids. I said ok and hung up the phone. 

My blood was boiling at this point because my sister in law is always pawning him off on people. Neither my brother or my sister in law have jobs they‚Äôre on unemployment due to COVID. It really pissed me off that they knew we had stuff going on and he could easily ride in the car to big lots with them. I was afraid they were going to leave him here all day knowing we had plans.

My mother and I are close but she has a tendency to start drama and run her mouth. It gets old really fast. I moved in with my best friend. I paid for the condo myself. It‚Äôs in my name. I worked so hard to be able to afford this place. 
My mother called and asked to stay at my condo for a bit because my father had been in a foul mood for a few days and things had got to the breaking point and she needed a break. So of course I allowed her to come and stay. I went to take a nap and when I woke up I heard my mother telling my roommate about my personal history.

About a year ago, when we were clearing out stuff, we found a external hard drive which was still in its original packaging. It belonged to none of us and we put it in the communal drawer. 

I am currently moving and packed the hard drive as I needed one and none of my housemates had claimed it in more than a year. It had just been sitting there in the drawer, still originally packed. I didn‚Äôt think much of taking it as it didn‚Äôt belong to anyone... 

Now one of my housemates is deeply upset that I didn‚Äôt ask them about taking it. She said I should have discussed it with the house.

I (14f) work for my dad as a receptionist. He runs a doctor's office and has had trouble finding receptionists. He asked me to work for him two years ago and I agreed. I work whatever days he asks me to on school breaks and sometimes on weekends or days off from school. The work day is anywhere from coming in for 3 hours to coming in 9 to 6. Normally I'll come in 9 to 3. Around the beginning of this year I was thinking of getting an actual job so I can have some of my own money and not have to ask my parents as well as having work experience that I can put on a resume. When I was looking for jobs and asking my mom how to apply and interview for one my dad got a bit offended and asked why I'm not working for him. I asked if I could get paid and he said that he already pays for my things and gives me a roof over my head/food on the table and gives me money if I ask for it. 

My parents dont do allowances or chore/good grade money. They give me money if I ask for it but there are always a ton of follow up questions and my dad generally gets annoyed, also it's never fun to ask someone for money. Before last year I never really went out but I'm starting to now and I need change for the bus or if I want to get food or any other things.

I asked to get $20 each day I go in which I think is pretty reasonable but my dad insists that I can just ask for money when I need it. I'm a pretty good kid so it's not like I'm going to go buy drugs or alcohol.

689,WIBTA if I ask my bestfriend to just sell/give her puppy to me?,37,Not the A-hole,12,hrmwke,1594845995.0,"On mobile, apologies for the format.

Background: I (24F) have two bestfriends, Carla (24F) and Ana (25). Due to remote working conditions, I invited Carla and her girlfriend Mae (23F) to live with me and my boyfriend (29M) in the meantime due their struggles with the internet connection. Carla‚Äôs and Ana‚Äôs houses are just a few blocks from where I live anyway. I‚Äôve known Carla and Ana for 14 years. Ana and Carla known each other for 20 years. They‚Äôre both basically my sisters. Ana and I would very rarely have a misunderstanding, maybe less than 5 since we‚Äôve known each other, and Carla would always be our middle ground.

Into the challenge, Ana has asked for a pomeranian puppy from her other group of friends and it was promised to her (we know nothing about this). A couple of weeks ago while coming home from visiting Mae‚Äôs place, Carla called us to pick her up (after declining our invitation that morning) and buy her takeout (yes she‚Äôs kind of spoiled by me & Carla, especially me since I come from a comfortable life), and so we did. While eating in the car, Ana mentioned if she can pickup the promised pomeranian and we did.

Knowing that I‚Äôm a dog lover, she mentioned she was going to give it to me because the puppy can‚Äôt stay in their house after her mother refused to take it in. Imagine how elated I was! I mentioned we three were all going to be a mum to this puppy.

This is where we had a challenge, the next conversations we‚Äôve had in the condo Ana always mentions it‚Äôs her puppy, and the only reason it‚Äôs with us is due to her mother refusing. At this point it is very clear that Ana maintains the ownership of the puppy. That‚Äôs completely fine with me, we still considered ourselves co-furparents. I‚Äôve also told my boyfriend that the puppy is Ana‚Äôs.

Now Ana‚Äôs family isn‚Äôt well off, also Ana has no job and is still living with her parents. When we first met the puppy and she mentioned she‚Äôs ‚Äúgiving it to me‚Äù I already planned a schedule with the vet. But now that I knew that it‚Äôs hers and will take it (whenever) I‚Äôm having second thoughts. She stayed with us the first time the puppy came here for a few days and had both me and Carla pay for the puppy groceries, etc. Then Ana went NC for the next couple of weeks and I‚Äôm left shopping and caring for a baby pup while working 10-12hrs a day at home. My boyfriend has started giving me talks how I spend and care for a puppy that isn‚Äôt even mine. Now I am thinking of asking her straight up if she can just give or sell the puppy to me since she‚Äôs got nowhere to keep the puppy anyway, WIBTA?

TL;DR: bestfriend got a puppy she mentioned she was going to give me, turns out she‚Äôs planning to keep it even if she doesn‚Äôt have the means (no job) and place, but left the puppy with me (caring&expenses) for the next couple of weeks and went NC",False,False,2020-07-15 13:46:35
690,AITA for arguing with my mother over something that happened when I was a child?,37,Not the A-hole,22,hqwiw3,1594737501.0,"I (32F) visited my family over the weekend with my fianc√© and my stepson. The COVID restrictions have been lifted in our two states (we're in Australia), so we took the opportunity to take some time away and see them.

One of the evenings, we were sitting by the fire and talking about *shrug* just shit I guess, and it came up (not for the first time in my life) about how my mum hated me between the ages of 8 and 10. This is not new information to me, but it has always bothered me.

Some background: just before I turned 8, my parents and I moved two hours away from what I had considered my home town. I had friends, I enjoyed school, I was a reasonably well adjusted kid as far as I remember. But we moved about two months before the end of the school year, and from my first day at my new school, I was bullied relentlessly. I had trouble making friends, I was bullied by my babysitter's sons after school, I was treated like an outcast because I was bookish and shy, and I HATED everything about my new home. I resented being taken away from my friends, and the constant bullying made me angry and bitter and sad. It got to the point where I was bullied on the bus by kids who didn't even go to my school... I still don't know what made me such a target. The bullying didn't stop until I was nearly 16. During this time my mum also was dealing with a serious back injury, had back surgery, and was in and out of hospital for several years. I had to be pretty self sufficient as my Dad worked ridiculous hours, and there were days when Mum just couldn't even walk. Apparently I was a nightmare of a child for those two years, moody and unhappy, and since reaching adulthood, my mum has said it more than once, usually in a lighthearted way, but it has always stung.

So this time, I argued with her. I told her I went from being happy and having friends to being miserable and lonely and feeling unheard and having no friends and being constantly bullied, and that makes a mark on a person. She just responded with her usual brushing it off, and said I just wasn't willing to accept change and I was a difficult child. I kept arguing it, which she got a bit pissed about, until I dropped it and went to bed. My partner and I debriefed about it, and I felt like my mum would just never see the damage I have dealt with because of everything that happened in those two years, and that she was an AH for not being willing to see my point of view. But my mum kind of thinks I was the AH because, well, apparently I just sucked as a child for two years. Was I TA for arguing with her?",False,1594710869.0,2020-07-14 07:38:21

I kind of went off and told him that this was the exact reason I didn‚Äôt want to be with him. I never know when something is happening in this life.

Anyways, when I ordered yesterday they rang it in as a mocha ice Capp, which costs more and removed the whipped topping but still charged me $4. I stated I did not want the whipped topping nor do I want to pay the price for it to be on there and not get it.

There is a stupid rule in my house where if you see food, you can eat it, no matter who it belongs to. But my mother and step father are complete hypocrites about it- one example is when I ate a slice of salmon in a sandwich, and my step dad screamed at me and then proceeded to sabotage whatever food I cooked for the next two days (I spent hours making a special fried rice with three types of meat and specially made sauce that took even longer and he immediately snatched up the entire lot, around five portions, and fed it to the dogs so I cant eat). I honestly think this rule as a whole is a massive issue, especially for me because I struggle with my appetite, I barely ever feel the urge to eat so Im underweight and I *need* to eat whenever I can. Sometimes I‚Äôll get something really nice that Im looking forward to, but cant eat it because Im not hungry then, only to not ever be able to eat it as it was taken from the fridge and eaten by another family member which ends up with me going hungry. Ive lost a lot of weight lately which is really bad for me, so its really really frustrating to see the complete lack of care form the others. This even happened to my own birthday cake- if you‚Äôre not fast you‚Äôre last, I guess.

Its also started some really unhealthy habits, like hiding food in my room and eating it later even if it‚Äôll probably give me food poisoning due to being out of the fridge, forcing myself to overeat because Im scared it‚Äôll be taken away, and being completely unable to sleep at night due to the constant weight of anxiety that my food is going to be gone when I wake up. I‚Äôm just sick of getting my hopes up for a meal only to have to go hungry when its snatched away from under me. I want to be able to gain enough weight that I cant see my bones and muscle through my skin. Its gotten to the point where my friends think I have a six pack but its just my muscle being completely visible under my skin due to lack of fat

My mother thinks I‚Äôm selfish and keeps telling me to ‚Äòjust be faster‚Äô if I want nice food but I physically cant without forcing myself to eat and throwing up later so idk if somethings just wrong with me and I should be grateful I get treats 

The only time my mother has ever seemingly felt bad about this rule is when we all got a cream cake each. I love these things so much and only get them maybe twice a year so I sat down and forced myself to eat every single bite in one sitting. She noticed how sickly and miserable I looked eating it and just asked me to put it in the fridge for later- I told her that someone would eat it and she just went quiet.

TL;DR: It depends on how fast you are if you want to eat in this house, have to go hungry because I have appetite problems, starting to lose weight fast so Im getting snappy about it and my mother thinks Im an AH for complaining",False,False,2020-07-11 16:46:23
694,AITA for refusing to pay more for a house/mortgage even though I earn more?,34,Not the A-hole,72,hpb8ua,1594507928.0,"So a bit of background, my boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years, and living together for 6. When we decided to move in together, I was a very broke uni student working part time while he was working full time at a great job. We mutually decided to not share a bank account or share savings, mainly because my boyfriend didn‚Äôt want me to spend his hard earned money (which I totally agreed with). Because of that, I struggled for two years (until I graduated) to pay rent and pretty much survive but never asked or expected him to give me money. 

When I graduated, we both started earning the same amount of money but continued to have seperate bank accounts which worked for us with no issue. About 18 months ago we decided to start saving for a house but because we both suck at saving long term, we decided to get another bank account that we used only for savings. We also agreed to keep it 50/50 so we always discussed how much we were depositing each week. For example, even if one of us could afford to put aside $400 a week, if the other person could only afford $100, then we would both put aside only $100. 

Anyway, about a month ago I got a huge promotion at work, and suddenly I was earning $40,000 more a year. My boyfriend was ecstatic for me but also started making comments to friends and family about how it meant we could now afford a house sooner. I sat him down and explained that even though I was now earning more, our agreement shouldn‚Äôt change and that we should both continue to pay the same amount each week. 

He became really angry, calling me selfish and greedy and saying that I clearly don‚Äôt consider him a permanent part of my future. I explained that it was my hard earned money, not his and that I hadn‚Äôt expected him to pay for me when I was a broke uni student so why should he expect me to. It‚Äôs calmed down now, we agreed to disagree but I was taking to my parents and they think I‚Äôm being an asshole. 

So am I being a selfish asshole?

Edit: I feel like I should add that the 50/50 thing is just for the savings account. I‚Äôd be happy to spend more money than him if we were having a date or if we bought something for the house. Like if there was an activity we‚Äôve always wanted to do but couldn‚Äôt afford, then I would happily pay the difference because it‚Äôs a once off event.

I'm not going to deny it. I'm also really quite slow and probably one of the worst cooks you could ever meet. 

Tonight, as a family, we had burgers for tea like we do one or 2 nights a week. Nothing unusual there. The unusual thing is that my mum decided that we should have onion on them.

I was only told about this as the burgers were coming out of the oven because ""it'll only take 5 minutes"".

Long story short, it took me about 20 with a lot of being shouted at for being useless, cutting them too large initially, and my mum taking over because ""I should have been done by now, if I'd know you were this stupid I would have done then myself"" [paraphrasing, but basically the same].

So once the onion was done, my mum sorted her burger, I sorted my burger, and called to my dad and brother that the onion was done.

I walked into the living room. 

""What are you doing, where's the onion?"" ""Its in the kitchen."" ""Well go get it then.""

I put down my plate, went to the kitchen, and bought back the pan with the onion in it. Apparently completely the wrong way to do this, but I wasn't told this until after they had taken half the onion each out the pan, I'd taken the pan back, and sat back down. 

After this, my parents started talking about how useless someone can actually be before they just stop existing [once again, paraphrasing].

When I realized there was extra money not going either towards our bills, our house, or savings, I asked if he was sending money to someone this month.

703,AITA For Snapping At My Younger Sister?,38,Not the A-hole,18,hro4cj,1594850594.0,"Okay so before this starts, I need to say this. My sister is a good sister. She and I have a good relationship. I just need some judgment on this.

Cast:

Me: I'll go by K
My little sister.
My dad.


This started a few days before the main event. My sister made a comment that mad me uncomfortable and I told my mom. She said that my sister was just curious about my body.

Two days after, she came into the room I was in. I was just grinding on overwatch. She asked me if I had a crush on anyone. I said ""No, sorry""

At dinner that night. She had her life planned out. She was talking about it and said ""and Kaelie will give my kids cousins!"" I stoped her there and said I wasn't having kids.

She said I had to.

I snapped at her and told her I didn't want to. That I might not be straight. That I might be lesbian, or asexual, or just not attracted to anyone. 

After I said this, she stormed off to our shared room. (We have an older sister) My dad came over and said ""K, you need to apologise."" I nodded and went back upstairs. She was angry at me and just said ""OK"" when I apologised.

(Some other things: Our class had a pervert in it. I go to a catholic school and at a mission he dared me to strip for 100 dollers. I really don't really want to be in a relationship with boys. Also I said that because I like my Best friend.)

Was I in the wrong for snapping at my sister?

704,AITA for not wanting to be friends?,34,Not the A-hole,17,hpl55j,1594542715.0,"I (21F) met these two girls (both 20F) through some mutual friends. Girl #1 is very loud and outspoken, and some *really* nasty posts started showing up on her social medias about a girl who she hates with the nickname ""Psycho Bitch."" Almost all of her posts were like this for weeks on end. Eventually, a friend said that they think these posts are about me. I asked Girl #1 what I'd done. I could not think of anything I'd done and I was genuinely worried. She said I'd done some ""really horrible things"" but refused to elaborate because ""I should know what I did."" She also made a comment about how when our friends say I'm the ""sweet one"" in the group, they're joking and no one actually thinks I'm a good person after ""what I did.""

I panicked and texted our mutual friends and explained what Girl #1 had been saying. Everybody was confused and then started to get angry. Apparently, they had been telling friends elaborate lies about how I was using them for money (I'm *extremely* low-income and sometimes my friends buy me groceries, and I try to pay back in other ways like cleaning) or using the guys for attention (a couple guys were into me and I'd made it clear I wasn't interested). My feelings were pretty hurt, but I moved on. About a month went by and I started dating one of my friends (M21). Girl #2 promptly went to him, said she had feelings for him, and asked him to break up with me. I complained about that a little bit, but I let that go too.

Finally, Girl #2 came and apologized to me, saying she'd gone along with everything Girl #1 had done and wanted, but that it was wrong and she's sorry and wants to be friends. She admitted that I never actually did anything wrong, they had just been jealous that I'm well-liked and that guys were giving me attention instead of them. I said I forgive her, of course, but I'm not gonna be friends with her. She got really mad, saying that when I'd told people she and the other girl lied, **everyone** stopped talking to them and even chose not to live with them this fall anymore. I had no idea that had happened. She then said that it's my responsibility to get my friends to hang out with her again, because I'm the reason they stopped and I'm ""supposed to be the nice one"".

I try to be kind and understanding to everyone, but I never lied and everyone made their own choices, so I don't think it's my responsibility. I don't trust that they've changed and just want to move on. I do feel really bad that they lost their friends because I know how it feels to be alone, but these are the consequences for their own actions as adults.

At the time I was dating this girl, Kelly. Kelly was really girl friends with her ex boyfriend, Jake. She wasn‚Äôt into him at all anymore (they dated back in high school) but I could always tell that he still had feelings for her. In all honesty it made me uncomfortable but I trusted her. 

One day Kelly told me that her, Jake, and Jake‚Äôs friend Jared were going to hang out the Jake‚Äôs restaurant. (Jake‚Äôs family owned a small restaurant, mostly pizza). Kelly said that they offered to give them a free pizza to split for dinner. Kelly asked me if I wanted to join them and I was already uncomfortable about it. I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of Jake for obvious reasons. Kelly was insistent, though, so I agreed and She called Jake to let him know I was coming.

I then watched what I can only describe as an incredibly awkward conversation. I only heard one side, but it was a lot of ‚Äúoh... oh... okay... yeah... okay.‚Äù 

Kelly then told me that she still wanted me to come, but I was going to have to pay if I came. I was like ‚Äúokay no problem we have to pay whatever.‚Äù And she clearified that no... I was going to have to pay. Only ME. 

Long story short we got into a huge argument and I didn‚Äôt go. She called me an entitled asshole and said that they weren‚Äôt required to give me free food. She said they didn‚Äôt know me that well so why should they? Now, I know I‚Äôm not entitled to free food, especially from a small family owned business, but it just seemed a little odd to single me out like that. Especially since we would be SPLITTING A PIZZA...

Anyways, I didn‚Äôt end up going. The relationship didn‚Äôt last to much longer. To add to it, I‚Äôm still 100% convinced that this was just a further ploy from Jake to steal my ex. Jake did ask my ex out after we broke up and she turned him down. I‚Äôm only saying this to further the point that I really didn‚Äôt like this kid, and had a valid reason for it.

We've had these calls quite often over the years and I know 100% the reason guys don't stay with her. She's completely selfish and terrible in bed. How do I know? Well, I now her and how she talks about sex with partners, and I dated someone in the past who had also had a fling with her.

Usually I let her vent but this time I thought it went too far. The guy she's seeing was great! (Of course pandemic notwithstanding, I'm sure it had some pressure on their relationship.) He was smart, cute, sexy, and kind from what I saw. I bet it had something to do with how she's basically a starfish in bed, treats BJs like they're moving mountains, and basically sticks to 1-2 things in her little box of ideas.

I told her in no impolite terms that sexual compatibility is important (I went through the same challenge with my bf where we agreed upon a compromise around anal because we both loved everything else about the relationship). In this day and age, guys want adventurous women and it's going to be hard to find someone compatible if your bar is very high. You might find someone but it'll take time. 

After the call, our group chat blew up where she vented to the group that I was telling her it's her fault for not getting good guys because she doesn't put out like <my name> and that <my name> thinks being a good girlfriend is being a good slut for your man.

She‚Äôs been in my life since I was a small child and just recently passed away on Sunday. My boyfriend and I live about an hour away from where my family is, and we have been dating 7 months. 

Monday:

I let my boyfriend know the funeral arrangements, and he and offered to cover for me in dog sitting for our friend while I was in town for the visitation, seeing family, etc. I said thank you, and asked if he would be able to come to the funeral Friday afternoon. He said he had a meeting at that time but would try to get it moved. I said okay, it would mean a lot, so please try your best. 

Wednesday: 

I ask about if he was able to get his meeting moved. He said ‚Äúno, I told her I had a personal matter to attend to and asked if she was available another time but there was nothing available, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù I was irritated that he didn‚Äôt mention that it was a funeral and not just a personal matter‚Äî if people know it‚Äôs for a funeral they‚Äôre much more forgiving of people in when they cancel or reschedule. I told him this and asked him to again please try his best to make it work. 

Thursday:

 I came into town Thursday afternoon. At 4pm at the visitation, it all really hit me and I had a little bit of a breakdown. My parents have each other, my siblings have their spouses, and I don‚Äôt have my person. I have to hold my own hand and cry over my grandmas casket by myself instead of having my person here to support and comfort me when I‚Äôm in a hard place. I texted my bf from the funeral home and was like ‚Äúthis is so much harder than I thought it would be, if you could make it work so that you could be here for me it would mean a lot.‚Äù 

He replied that he‚Äôs really sorry but he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot in a position to be cancelling this late of notice.‚Äù This is where it upset me. He keeps saying he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù be here, but he can... he is just choosing not to. I understand that he is trying to stick to the responsibilities and commitments he‚Äôs made at his new job, but I feel like this should be more important. I feel that he is being selfish and is prioritizing his job over my feelings and our relationship right now, and it‚Äôs hurtful. If he had initially tried harder to get out of the meeting when I asked him, we wouldn‚Äôt be having this fight, but now he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù be here because he didn‚Äôt try hard enough in the first place. 

Instead of spending my evening catching up with family, I spent it arguing on the phone with him trying to convince him to just be here for me when I need him. I was exhausted emotionally and physically, so we just kept going in circles until I was tired of talking about it.

I'm temporarily living with my partner and his dad while I get some things sorted out. MIL passed away at the beginning of the year. 

FIL is very old school. He is retired and spends his days enjoying life, putting time into his hobbies, lazing about. I don't fault him for it, he worked incredibly hard up until his retirement. What always irked me was that MIL would work long days on her feet (7am until at least 6:30pm), only to then come home to cook and clean for him because that was a ""woman's job"". That's not my cup of tea in terms of lifestyle, but whatever. 

I work long shifts, typically around 12 hours but due to my job they can be longer if something goes wrong. The last few weeks I'd cook for partner and FIL, but I thought it was a bit unfair. Partner finishes work at 4pm every day and is home by 4:30, but FIL never asks him to cook. 

I came home last night to FIL asking ""What's for dinner?"" and something in me snapped. I responded with, ""What will you be making?"" 

Cue him screaming (he has a bad temper, I'm not exaggerating) at me for disrespecting the man of the house, especially when I've been living there for 3 weeks rent free (he told me not to pay rent). I ended up angrily cooking spaghetti, salting the pasta water with my tears (joking), but I'm still so upset. My partner understands my frustration but said that I should have told FIL I didn't have the energy to cook, because what I responded with was too passive aggressive so I'm conflicted.

Due to growing up and attending uni in London, my girlfriend doesn‚Äôt have a driving license. I do as I grew up in the countryside. 

Last month we were driving from her parents house back to our flat. It was nighttime, on a single lane road and it was lightly raining, nothing I was uncomfortable driving in. 

As I turned a corner I distinctly remember slowing down, so much so that I dropped into 4th gear, and then suddenly a deer ran out and across the road. My girlfriend screamed, grabbed the steering wheel and pulled it left (right hand drive) which ended up steering us off the road and into a tree. Totalling the car and setting off the airbags. 

Of course our initial thoughts were on safety so we exited the car and called emergency services and her parents. We got a lift back to her parents and that was that. 

The next morning I questioned what we were going to do about the car. Apparently ‚Äúit‚Äôs your car, so you can just buy a new one.‚Äù As if I had ¬£5k just lying in the bank. She also claimed that it was my fault for driving too fast so I reminded her about dropping a gear. 

Unfortunately for my girlfriend I drive her to work every morning and then pick her up on the way back from my job, so without me she has no way of commuting.

I very clearly told her that she would be paying for the new car as it was her who drove us off the road. She started crying because she doesn‚Äôt have enough money and would need to take out a loan at the bank. 

I told her she had one month to find ¬£5k or I would seriously reassess our relationship and take it to petty claims court. (We are both furloughed and expecting to start working again before the end of the month.) 

Well the month is up tomorrow so-

710,AITA to go on vacation against my mother's wish?,33,Asshole,45,ho76r6,1594344220.0,"I (F20) have been always saving up money for my new apartment for school.  My boyfriend and our friends have decided to go on a vacation just to get out of town.  I am in desperate need of a vacation due to personal reasons, but my mother doesn't think so.  She always has had some reason for me not to go on vacation with anyone.  I have quite a bit of money saved up and it would barely cost me anything to pay for the flight, the AirBNB, and the rental car (around $350-$400 all together).  I don't spend money really at all unless it's for stuff I need or the occasional fast food trip.

The cabin we got is very isolated in the mountains, only an hour and a half away from the city and the beach.  We aren't going to make trips out every day and we know how to make our own food in case the restaurants are still shut down.  Due to the pandemic, we will be bringing a bunch of masks and will be sure to social distance when we do go out.  We are also taking a COVID test before we leave to ensure that none of us have it.  We just want to get out of state and hang out basically.  But this is not good enough for my mother.

She complains that we are going too far away and that we should stay closer, but I have to explain that everyone already put down payments and they're going with or without me (I know I haven't told her that I already have as well, but as of now, the vacation starts next week and I've been trying to talk to her about this for a little over a month so I just need to tell her that I'm going).  She then says it's selfish of me to go because I have an apartment to pay for, but I already have a job lined up and a plan in case everything were to fall through (since my apartment is paid rent by my FAFSA).  She keeps finding reasons on why I shouldn't go and guilt tripping me to where I almost didn't go and just let the money fall through.

The other part is that she wants me to be closer to my family who lives a few hours away from where I'm staying.  I think a reason behind it is that she hasn't seen her mom (my grandmother) in a couple years and she's jealous that I'm going and wants me to take the car that all 6 of us are gonna use out to where my relatives live for a day.  I don't want to take the car to do that when others will need it as bad as I want to see them.

Basically, AITA for going on vacation with my own money that I have saved up?

Tl;Dr : Mother mad at me for wanting to go on vacation and guilt tripping me into not going.  I'm using my own money.  She's afraid the apartment bills will land on her or some other reasons that she makes up on the spot.

The photo in question has me, my husband, our kids, all of our siblings, their kids, our parents, and everyone's dates. The term ""dates"" includes my dad's girlfriend, my step dad, my 2 brother in laws (including the one in the title), my sister in law, my brother's fiancee (now wife), my husband's brother in law, and my husband's brother's girlfriend.

I hired my friend from uni, who is also a photographer, for the wedding photos. Of the staged photos, there are no photos without the non-blood relatives. Everyone mentioned in the first paragraph was in the family photo, then there were additional photos with just the wedding party, just my family, just his family, just us and the kids, etc. Point is, there are no photos that include our entire families that don't also include the in laws.

We got copies of pretty much every photo, and most of them are in our photo albums but the one with us and the kids, plus the group shot of everyone in the first paragraph, are now on display in our home, plus our parents and siblings asked for specific photos, which we got them. The respective families wanted the ones with just their side, which included all the in laws, and all 3 sets of parents asked for a photo of us and the kids.

But now my sister has divorced her husband. I've asked what happened, she's not talking about it, but she came over earlier and on seeing the group photo asked me why I still have it up. I told her it's my wedding photo, with my family in, of course I still have it up. Then she asks me why I haven't gotten him photoshopped out when I got my mother in law photoshopped and I said that wasn't the same thing (my mother in law wore a white dress so the photographer changed it to green) and that I wasn't going to send it back nearly 2 years later to get rid of her husband. Then my sister asked why I hadn't put something over his face, and at that point I just flat out told her she was being ridiculous, at one point in time he was family, and frankly I have bigger things to worry about than her ex husband being in my wedding photo.

She left upset, and later I got a call from my mother, essentially saying that my sister is heartbroken over her divorce and me having that reminder in my home and that plus how I snapped at her isn't making it easier. Mum then admitted she took down her group photo and just left up the one of me, my husband, and the kids, to make things easier for my sister. I asked my siblings if they'd done the same and if I was in the wrong here, and while one was on my side, the other basically said that me expecting them to keep the photo despite my sister's heartbreak was bordering bride-zilla despite it being nearly 2 years post-wedding.

Alright- so I‚Äôm pregnant! It all happened so fast, our child was a surprise to both me (25F) and my (27m) husband. We‚Äôve been married almost 2 years and we‚Äôve been together since highschool. 

My dilemma comes here, I‚Äôm very excited about our baby, I‚Äôm reading parenting books, and shopping for the nursery, etc.. My husband however doesn‚Äôt seem to be too fazed by it, he never really talks about my pregnancy or how he‚Äôs excited to be a parent. The only time I‚Äôve heard him really talk about kids is when I bring up the topic.
To me, this was strange because ever since highschool, all throughout our engagement, and the latter part of our marriage, he‚Äôs been so enthusiastic about being a dad. 
Growing up around small children constantly, it‚Äôs been my dream to be a mother since I was a literal baby. 
I was discussing names with my sister in law, and my husband (E) kept shutting down my choices when I asked why he said because they sound stupid. 

Me: why do they sound stupid?

E: they just do, I don‚Äôt want my kid to have been named after a flower (I suggested Chrysanthemum)

Me: okay, so what names do you suggest?

E: I don‚Äôt know. 

Me: it‚Äôs a pretty name an I like flowers, so why not?

E: okay, I love wrestling, I‚Äôm not gonna name my kid after a wrestler. 

Me: I wouldn‚Äôt expect you to

E: all the names sound stupid. 

I was really angry and upset at this point, he had dismissed every single name I suggested and he would change the topic from baby related things to whatever was on TV at that moment. After his sister left I asked him what his problem was, I asked him why he was being such a jerk and and he responded with, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just tired of hearing the same shit from you every day.‚Äù I began tearing up and I asked him if he even cared about the pregnancy, and if he really only wanted to have kids because I had talked it up so much.

For the most part, our relationship for the past 3 months has been without major issues, however, just recently, he did something pretty stalker-ish (finding out my address without me telling him) and the way he did it rose a major red flag and I'm scared this could be a precedent for something much worse to come.

The reason why I say this is because in a past relationship, my then-boyfriend who knew my address, would not stop emailing me, calling me, or threatening me to harm himself if I ever decided to break up with him. He even visited my flat and waited outside for me without me knowing. Needless to say, these were all massive red flags and to this day, has made me SUPER uncomfortable with the idea of sharing any sort of personal information with a SO or otherwise (something I will fix in the future, hopefully)

But anyway, my current boyfriend being nice as he is, decides to send me a gift which I've been talking about for a while. Except just as I was about to give him my address, I find out he already knew what it was and sends it to me by text. I can tell you without a doubt, I had NEVER given him my address, nor mentioned it, or accidentally uttered it, and if I did, I would've known (as mentioned earlier I'm very cautious about that stuff now) He knew my door number, flat number, and my postcode. I was VERY creeped out by that, and when I asked him he simply responded '' I found out legally don't worry''

I press him about the ''legality'' of this, to which he states its a secret. He keeps brushing it off as something unimportant and said that I mentioned it in conversation. Odd right? So then I start thinking maybe it's my fault, maybe I DID accidentally mention it in passing conversation and he just won't tell me. I text a friend about the situation and she stresses that I need to ask him up front instead of doubting myself. So I do and he tells me this:

During one of my calls, (2 months ago)  I was asking him to help me pick an outfit for a party, and I was screen sharing on my laptop. My mum came in and asked me to order something quickly for her. So I auto-paid by PayPal and unknowingly, he got his camera out and took a picture of the screen. Fast forward to today, this is the same image he's used to buying me my gift (he sent it to me when he admits it). I only went to order my mum the item for a split second so for him to have the idea of whipping his camera out to take a pic seemed off.

After finding this out I ask him why he did this and he says that he simply needed to know my address, and since we're together, he just needed to know it. I made it clear that I found that very weird and concerning because he could've simply asked me. I told him I was creeped out about it basically, and now I'm worried I've made him feel guilty. I feel bad about it.

717,WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt become my autistic brother's legal guardian?,57,Not the A-hole,128,hrvjzp,1594874205.0,"I have an autistic twin brother, however I don‚Äôt have autism and am female. 
Late 2019 and this year my parents brought up the topic of my brother and someone being his legal guardian once they pass, since he won‚Äôt be able to live on his own. I told them ok well who did they have in mind for that since it would be a big role, and they told me that they expected me to sign as his guardian once we both turn 18 since that is the year he has a court hearing to see what happens to him. 

Instantly I told them I wasn‚Äôt going to do it. I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing it when I turn 18 because what happens if my parents die while I‚Äôm in college do I have to drop everything and get a full time job to take care of my brother. 
The other thing is also what happens if it happens when I‚Äôm older. I plan on moving away from home as much as I possibly can and have pets with me since I love animals. I‚Äôm not sure if my brother would want to move but the bigger problem is my pets. My brother hates any pet that isn‚Äôt a fish while I would want to have a dog or a cat and I know in my heart I couldn‚Äôt just get rid of them because my brother would move in after I had the pet in my house for longer and got attached to them. 

When I mentioned that I would have a problem with it to my parents they told me I shouldn‚Äôt have any problem after all I don‚Äôt plan on getting married or having kids which is true I don‚Äôt think I will ever marry someone and I can‚Äôt stand babies or small children. My mom then went on a rant and said I shouldn‚Äôt be selfish after all who else could they ask any of my other cousins, nope they shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave to put their life on hold for him‚Äù (her exact words) but I should since I‚Äôm his sister and his twin so I should always be there for him. After telling them my doubts they told me I‚Äôm a selfish asshole who doesn‚Äôt care about family and what happens to them.

I feel guilty for not wanting to become his guardian but I just can‚Äôt handle that responsibility on top of my own stuff. Maybe I could do it if I had more time to get my life together before I signed but I know I can‚Äôt as of right now and I‚Äôm dreading next year. 

I‚Äôll try to answer as many questions as I can.

Edit one: I didn‚Äôt make this clear so my bad but they want me to be his guardian after my parents die. I would just have to make that decision at 18 but he won‚Äôt be under my guardianship until my parents are dead but I‚Äôm still against it since I don‚Äôt know when they will die and can‚Äôt guarantee I will be ready when that happens.",False,1594852581.0,2020-07-15 21:36:45

He had been in police custody for almost 3 hours before they finally decided to call and report him missing.

After an hour of my 3 yr old saying he wants to go in then having a meltdown when he got close to the pool, we all decided to leave. The next day my husband is going on and on about how I abused our child by forcing him into the pool and he won't sit around watching his child suffer and be thrown into a pool when he's scared. He then proceeded to tell me that I'd be causing psychology damage to our son if I brought him near a pool ever again. I calmly said that our son won't get over his fear of the pool if we shelter him from it forever. My husband then told me I might as well teach our 3yr old to drive while I'm at it because that's the same level of danger I'm putting our child in by wanting to teach him how to swim and not to be scared of the water. I dropped the topic and just chalked it up to him having PTSD because he didn't have the best child himself. Fast forward to a few days ago when my husband was in our backyard with our 3yr old and our dog. He had forgotten to lock the gate, our 3 yr old opened the gate and he and the dog ran towards the street( we live on a main street so there's a lot of speeding cars and trucks). I was doing dishes and I heard the gate open and heard my husband yell our son's name. Instantly I knew what happened and ran out the door to see my husband dragging his feet to stop our son from running into the street so I made a run for it to catch him and the dog. Since I grabbed them my husband decided to leave as I'm having a panic attack and in tears telling my son he shouldn't have done that he and the puppy could have gotten a bad boo-boo and mommy would have been really sad if that happened. My husband then tells me he doesn't understand why I'm acting so crazy and so upset because nothing happened. He was so calm about the whole thing and made me out to be paranoid and a helicopter mom for being upset over nothing. I asked him how he could not care that our son could have gotten hit by a car and he told me that I'm treating his calmness like it's a bad thing and he's a sociopath or something.

721,AITA for telling my boss she was being inappropriate toward me?,33,Not the A-hole,21,hq7idi,1594637784.0,"I (22F) have been working in a pharmacy for the last 3 years as a part time job to put myself through university. The main manager went on maternity leave last summer and is due back in January. Her replacement was another one of our pharmacists. She‚Äôs from Eastern Europe, and is very much brutally honest and by the book. 

I‚Äôm studying to be a teacher, and have just accepted a permanent teaching position in a rural community starting in September. I am beyond excited to start my career that I‚Äôve been dreaming of starting for the last 17 years, and finally put my month‚Äôs notice in today. 

The thing is, my boss hasn‚Äôt been doing a good job of keeping her distaste for my departure to herself. She congratulated me about getting the position last week. I was surprised about that because when the pandemic hit and she needed full timers, she told me that she wished I would drop out of school or flunk out so I could stay at the pharmacy full time because my class hours wouldn‚Äôt allow me to work 13 hours a day. I thought it was a joke and carried on. 

When I announced my month‚Äôs notice to my coworkers, she told me not to burn bridges with the place in case I need to go back. I asked why, and she told me that my career may not work out. I asked her what she meant by that and she told me that it‚Äôs no secret that she doesn‚Äôt want me to leave, and that there was no way I could be replaced, so the only way I could potentially stick around is if I hopefully leave teaching. 

I was gobsmacked. I told her that what she was saying was very inappropriate and hurtful. I told her that while I appreciated the compliments toward my skill, this is not where I want to spend my life. I told her that teaching is my dream job and I am doing whatever it takes for it to work out. She then told me that since I‚Äôve announced my notice, she won‚Äôt dismiss me, but I‚Äôve ruined my chances of ever coming back if I needed to. 

My parents and boyfriend think I‚Äôm in the right for saying what I said, but some of my coworkers have told me that that‚Äôs no way to thank someone for the skills they have given me. Reddit, AITA?

Edit: If anyone‚Äôs wondering about my chances of using her as a reference later, the school district I‚Äôm employed with only takes university professors and other teachers as references.

Edit 2: I think I should clarify that this isn‚Äôt the only little thing this pharmacist has done to keep me around. She has asked me to leave my teaching internship because ‚Äúthe pharmacy should be more important‚Äù. She also told the original manager not to teach me anything but cashier because she liked how I did things, when she knew I wanted to learn how to do other things in the pharmacy. When I was finally moved up by the first replacement manager to packaging prescriptions, I was beyond excited and I learned very quickly. As soon as the current manager took over, I was put back on cash because ‚ÄúI should only do what I know I‚Äôm good at‚Äù. She has a history of keeping me from moving forward in my job and using compliments as her reasoning. It doesn‚Äôt make me feel good, it makes me feel incompetent and that i would do a bad job anywhere but as a cashier. I‚Äôve stayed quiet for a long two and a half years, but I couldn‚Äôt stay silent anymore when she chose to backhand my dream job. 

Edit 3: Also, burning bridges is not the same as resigning. I fully planned on working to the best of my ability until I left. I still will. My reputation with customers and my coworkers won‚Äôt be tarnished by my departure. Only the manager‚Äôs pride because she couldn‚Äôt convince me to stay in a job I didn‚Äôt intend on staying in forever.",False,1594623276.0,2020-07-13 03:56:24

I'm an only child with a single mother who can be strict at times but growing up with i learnt to deal with. C's mum had problems with alcohol and custody was given to the stepfather, who C doesn't get along with, and sometimes ends up staying with different family on the mum's side people.

C came to stay with me and MM a while back, sleeping on the floor as we don't have a spare room.

C had been questioning and cam out as pan and changed pronouns which everyone accepted/congratulated.

Weeks later MM picks me up from school and says C ran away because MM confiscated C's phone (cannot be mentioned here why). MM went to school to take phone (she was letting C borrow - not C's) but they argued hard and MM got the phone and said they would talk after school.

Personally I think he gets a lot of women‚Äôs attention, and he is a very handsome man, but I am currently his only partner and I think that is factoring into his self esteem and self worth. When he told me about it, something he mentioned in the story made me think that she may be much younger. I asked him how old she was and he said that he didn‚Äôt ask her but that she mentioned being carded so he thought she may be under 21. It took me by surprise and I responded ‚Äúgeez‚Äù He responded by immediately accusing me of judging him, saying I burst his bubble, and  that he wouldn‚Äôt respond to her, ‚Äúwould that make me happy?‚Äù I responded that I wasn‚Äôt trying to make him feel bad, he knows my opinion on it (we have discussed that in the past) but that he is his own person and can make his own decisions and I just want him to be happy. It seemed like that calmed things down for a bit but we ended up getting into an argument over it. He brought up the time that I was 29 and I briefly dated a 44 year old. He asked if that was okay? But he knows that I slept with the (44m) once and immediately broke up with him after because I felt incredibly weird and uncomfortable about it. He then blamed me for not being supportive and understanding and called me a hypocrite (because he said I don‚Äôt wanted to be judged but that I judged him) He said things like- ‚ÄùNext time you meet someone I‚Äôm not going to support you. I‚Äôm going to start questioning you and see how you feel.‚Äù I apologized throughout the conversation several times for making him feel bad and that I didn‚Äôt think we needed to argue about it. His response was that apologies don‚Äôt fix hurt feelings. Another thing, which he brings up pretty often, is that he doesn‚Äôt get as much female attention as I do male attention. 90% of the male attention I get is men sexually harassing me, men that pretend to be my friend in hopes of sleeping with me, men that are rude to me if I turn them down, etc. That has gotten so bad lately that I am having some mental health issues over it. At one point in the conversation I mentioned that I needed emotional help over this topic but he refused because I hurt him with my opinion. He said that I do not get to demand sympathy from someone I hurt. He also said that he wanted a break so that I would learn to appreciate him. I did say he was overreacting, which I regret because I consider that gaslighting.

726,AITA for getting mad at my dad feeling ill?,32,Not the A-hole,27,ho5hpe,1594338717.0,"I know how this sounds, but hear me out.

Since last month, my dad's been having days in which he has stomach problems, and after a couple of days, the symptoms disappear. This has been going on and off, and I'm starting to worry.

Like, literally he has stomach ache and some other symptoms after eating certain things, he feels ill and eats almost nothing for one or two days, then he recovers for a week or less than that, and  then he starts again.

The red flag for me started when he fell ill after eating sushi but neither my mom, my brother or me fell ill. He recovered after 2 days, went for a couple of weeks fine, and then felt bad again, apparently because of a chocolate bar. Last night, he felt ill after having ice-cream. But again, my brother, mom and me are fine.

What pisses me off is that we've been telling him he should make an appointment with a doctor, and maybe later with a specialist (if he is in need of exams or that stuff), but he refuses, and just sort of ignores us and says its fine. And maybe he's fine and it's just some colitis or gastritis or something stress-related, but whatever it is, I believe it is better to be sure and take the proper meds. It may be even an unknown allergy or intolerance to some ingredients (you know, getting older makes food intolerance appear), but I don't see this pattern as a proper life, you know? Almost hoping that whatever you eat everyday doesn't make you ill.

I have been insisting more because I have a sort of fear (I dunno if it can be called phobia) of stomach illnesses, and of course, I hate to see him feeling that way.  Since the problem has been coming and going, I'm starting to fear it is something different, but he doesn't listen.

He won't lift the toilet seat before he pees (which I've talked to him about two or three times now), he leaves tags from his clothes everywhere, leaves body wash spilled all over the bathtub, and tracks in all kinds of dirt and other nastiness onto the floor. 

He also leaves trash all over the house, puts cigarette butts in his pockets (or something? I'm not really sure) and then they fall out all over the house, and just doesn't clean up after himself in general. 

Dude also has literal bags of stuff all over the house. Clothes, toys from his kids (who have only been here twice, it's not like he's got them over all the time) and three or four pairs of shoes. And honestly, all of his stuff stinks, he doesn't shower very often and his feet smell awful. He also has no idea when to stop talking, and will flat out interrupt people mid sentence to talk about whatever crosses his mind. 

My roommate likes having him here because she says he entertains her 6 year old, which is true. He has a switch and shares it with the kiddo. And he is genuinely fun to be around a lot of the time (and in small doses) but I'm getting tired of him being here. It feels like he's trying to covertly move in, and that honestly makes me really angry. She's suggested that he keep his stuff in the spare room so it's not in my way, but I honestly don't want to make him any more comfortable being here than he already is. He's already incredibly disrespectful in how he treats my home, and if he gets too comfortable then he's not going to want to leave.

Because of this, I've been trying to convince my dad that the best option is to move my mom out. It doesnt seem reasonable to leave the 4 bedroom family home (that she couldn't afford on her own), especially given her blatant disregard for the rest of the families feelings. 

I'm trying to keep myself thinking as logically as possible but I'm not sure if I've crossed the line into just being cold to the woman who raised me. Should I be encouraging my dad to go to couples therapy, advocating for another chance? I just want my family to be happy and honestly it doesn't seem like we make my mom happy anymore.

731,AITA for not letting my tio see our animals or my daughter?,28,Not the A-hole,28,hr9t36,1594788955.0,"I guess this is more of an are WE the assholes because this includes everyone in our household. 

So I'm a 21 F, my tio* is almost 50. 

I currently have a 2 month old daughter and we and my fiance live with my mom, her boyfriend and my sister (17F). We have 3 dogs and their names are Kingsford, Chester Boy, and Chapin (pronounced Cha-peen if you're wondering). I also have a cat who's name is Shadow. 

So to kind of explain this situation. My tio is a total man child. He ran off to California from Michigan, where we all live, as soon as he was out of college to be an actor and singer/songwriter. While waiting to get his big break he worked in restaurants as a bartender or waiter. He developed a huge drinking problem that cost him multiple jobs and his relationship as well as his housing with said girlfriend.

Since he's been back home my mom used to allow him to stay at our house to give my grandparents a break from him because he's just become too much to handle constantly with his drinking problem. While staying with us, he would puke all over the bathrooms, stink up the living room where he slept so bad nobody wanted to leave our bedrooms, and started calling my sister and I huge bitches and c*nts because we didn't saluda** him every single time we saw him in the house, even throughout the same day if no one had gone anywhere. 

Once he started calling my sister and I names and wouldn't accept my explanation of ""you're here all the time every day so we don't feel the need to say hi every time we see you"" and mixed with some other more personal issues I've had with him since I was a child, I dropped him. Stopped talking to him entirely. Ignored his existence and let my mom and my grandparents handle him. 

He eventually went too far for even my mom to handle and hasn't allowed him back to our house since this past winter.

My fiance and I agreed during my pregnancy we wouldn't allow him near our daughter.

Now that my daughter is here and we've been sticking to not allowing my tio to see our animals or my daughter my grandma has started regularly calling and asking if SHE can take the dogs and play with them at her house as a cover for my tio seeing them. We've told her no and we know why she's asking and she needs to stop and she's started to call all of us in the house cruel for keeping him from our animals and my fiance and I especially awful for keeping his family, my daughter, from him. She's been trying to talk us into letting her take the animals for months now and im starting to feel like maybe we're really as bad as she says? She's never spoken to me this way before and I'm starting to doubt myself and my family's decision.

When my grandma died my mum and us moved out of our home to live in my grans house with my aunt. My dad since moved into my mums house. 

The house is in her name and he gives her the money for bills so she can pay it off. My dads never been well with money. He‚Äôs struggling a lot so he got friends to live with him and help pay said bills. This has been going on for years now and it‚Äôs worked. 

Recently my sister (23) moved in with him and doesn‚Äôt have to pay recently and she told me about my mums plans to turn the house into a sort of apartment home for my sister, me and my sisters friends to live in. She plans to kick my dad out. I‚Äôve never seen my mum happy in a long time and this idea makes her happy because she gets to give her kids a home and she gets a bit of extra money on the side to help herself live a peaceful life. 

I asked my sister if my dad knew about this and she said ‚ÄúNo we‚Äôll tell him soon though.‚Äù Idk how I feel about this. My dad has plans to change some of the house and my mum and sister know this and want him to go through with it. He is spending his own money on this and nvm that but idk if he‚Äôd be able to afford another place (he probs will idk) and one of his roommates is moving out and a new one is moving in soon. By the sound of things my mum and sister plan to have this done soon and still haven‚Äôt told my dad or my dads gf. 

My dad was telling me about his plans for the house and he seems genuinely excited and it kills me to know what my mum and sister plan to do.

On the one hand, my mums been a victim of abuse recently and I‚Äôve never seen her genuinely happy or excited about something and this is a thing she‚Äôs wanted for years now. But on the other hand my dad is poor, he doesn‚Äôt know about these plans and he plans to make renovations for a house he‚Äôll be kicked out off.

He deserves to know at least a few months in advance to give him time to find a new home. 

Sorry if this was long.

TLDR; my mum plans to kick my dad out of his (technically her old) house to give it to my sister and her friends and she won‚Äôt tell him this.

Update: I‚Äôm going to tell my mum that my dad deserves to know what‚Äôs going on. She‚Äôs mentioned him planning to move to Spain with his gf and how he‚Äôd be fine but honestly I know that won‚Äôt happen. My dad and his gf are in a very toxic relationship that won‚Äôt last much longer and if it does I wouldn‚Äôt let him leave with her because she‚Äôs honestly horrible to him.

734,AITA for asking someone about their immigration?,30,Not the A-hole,23,hoqcw2,1594421755.0,"So this happened when I was in 8th grade about 15 years ago. The reason I‚Äôm posting now is because it still haunts me and I think wont stop until I get some closure on it. 

I had a close friend who was Korean. I obviously knew he was Korean but I guess I assumed he was at least second gen American since he went by an American first name, had no accent, etc. One day in homeroom it came up that he immigrated to the US when he was 6. I had a shocked reaction because I couldn‚Äôt believe I didnt know something so big about someone I was close with. I also had never met someone who wasn‚Äôt born in the US so I was massively curious. I had a million questions and I asked all of them. I‚Äôll admit I bet it was super annoying. I was 13. You can imagine. 

Here are some of the questions I remember asking: Why did your family immigrate? Do you still speak fluent Korean? Does your family speak Korean in your household? Was it hard to learn English? Was it easier for you to learn than your parents? What is your birth name since I assume it isn‚Äôt [name]? Do you remember much from growing up there? Or are most of your childhood memories here?

Well after the bell rang to go to 1st period, the teacher asked me to stay back. She started yelling at me for being a horrible racist and saying I am not better than anyone because I‚Äôm white. Then she burst into tears and said sorry but she‚Äôs never witnessed something so disgusting. Her first period class is coming in and watching all of this. It was humiliating. 

When you‚Äôre 13 you kinda assume every adult is right and knows what they‚Äôre talking about so I felt like I must have been a huge asshole. Now that so many years have passed, I look back and think no, an over-sensitive white woman decided to humiliate me because I asked someone questions about their life experience, but of course I could be biased.

735,AITA for refusing to eat my mom's vegan cooking?,34,Not the A-hole,78,hoflaq,1594372399.0,"My dad just recently divorced my mom after about 11 years of marriage. My mom was vegetarian for about 20 years and after the divorce she became vegan. The rest of my family, me (13), my brother (9), and my dad were not vegetarian or vegan. After the divorce my mom forced me and my brother to eat a completely vegan diet.

She cooks horrible vegan food that is disgusting and makes me throw up if I eat it. (I'm not saying vegan food is gross, I'm just saying the food she makes is gross.) She also doesn't allow us to bring non vegan food in her house, even if I go out and buy it with my own money myself. She keeps telling me everytime I bring it up that I'm 'brainwashed by the meat and dairy industry' and 'convinced that I need that food to be healthy.'

I'm the type of person that has dairy with every single meal. Milk in my cereal, two cups of milk a day, and cheese on everything. I hate the fake milk and cheese she buys and the cheese makes me want to throw up. Sometimes I skip breakfast or dinner because there isn't anything I like or she cooks food that I can't/don't to eat. I think it would be different if she let me buy my own food and eat it, but she refuses to have it in her house.

She was always fine with preparing meat for the whole family and she wasn't vegan until just now. I bring it up about every other day and it often turns into a screaming match. I try and be calm and reason with her, but my patience often runs thin because of all of her bullcrap. AITA

Another point to my mom's argument is that milk caused cancer. I THINK that this is backed up by a study that had no control group and wasn't reliable. It's frustrating because she's a slight alcoholic and that definitely causes cancer. I can't go live with my dad because it's been over a year since they divorced but they still actually aren't legally divorced because the court is taking along time to finalize everything.

736,AITA for not wanting to financially support my twin brother?,28,Not the A-hole,37,ho4skk,1594336331.0,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. Also, I'm on my phone, sorry. 

My twin brother and I, both 23, live together in one of our father's 2 houses. 

For the past 2 years father hasn't financially supported us, resulting in me having to drop out of college and get a job 1 year and 6 months ago (I had saved up from holiday jobs so I was able to finance everything for a couple months). 
With all of my savings gone, I had to spend the little money I made from my job in order to survive (I got a raise after 6 months, so now it's a little above minimum wage). 

I've been paying for literally everything for the past 18 months. Food, necessities, and stuff that's not my responsibility as a 23 yo male. 
I'm barely able to save any money, and I told father and brother I will no longer be brother's wallet, and both scolded me for it. 

Brother doesn't have a job and hasn't studied in about 2 years, claims he can't find a job because he doesn't have any form of degree. 
He also reaps benefits from the state, so I asked him if he could give me that money so I can use it to buy necessities; of course, that didn't happen. 

Living on my own isn't a possibility either. I'm not allowed to take the dog, Blaise, whom my aunt bought for me many years ago (on paper she's my father's), I can't leave my little girl behind, they don't care for animals. 

I do feel like an asshole because without me my brother has absolutely nothing and no-one, and now I'm taking that away from him. 

I also think my father is responsible for my brother's finances, and not me. But I can't convince either of them to stop expecting me to pay for everything, including renovations for the house (it's in bad shape). 

Recently I bought a new laptop, and suddenly I'm irresponsible with my money and ""how are you ever going to save up with spending so much money on useless rubbish"". That's what made me write this.

737,AITA for reporting my roommate‚Äôs boyfriend to campus police?,53,Not the A-hole,37,hruz9r,1594872417.0,"This happened 5 years ago during my freshman year of college. It‚Äôs a complex story, but I‚Äôll highlight the main points.

I (then F18) was roommates with ‚ÄúSara‚Äù (F18). We were in a friend group where we met ‚ÄúDylan‚Äù (M18) and ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù (M19). Dylan and Alex were friends in high school and were really close. Sara and Dylan started dating and I started dating Alex. Sara and Dylan also got close to our RA (F20). 

Dylan was a known asshole. Dylan always made offensive jokes about people, including me. He once saw me putting on makeup and said I‚Äôd ‚Äúneed more concealer if I wanted to ‚Äòcover all that up.‚Äô‚Äù Sara and Alex always defended him, saying ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just who he is,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt mean it.‚Äù Sara and Dylan also took over our dorm, and I had to stay with Alex all the time. Sara and I stopped talking.

Alex and I weren‚Äôt together long. He began to snap at me over little things and make me cry, so I dumped him and starting talking to a guy from my hometown. I was kicked out of the friend group for this. I ended up just staying in my dorm, and Sara started living in Dylan and Alex‚Äôs dorm. I just decided to focus on my studies and not worry about friends anymore.

After I dumped Alex, Dylan had it out for me. I brought the fridge and a whiteboard for the door, and I would find my food in Sara‚Äôs trash. Then, Dylan started writing the lyrics to ‚ÄúStupid Hoe‚Äù by Nicki Minaj on the whiteboard, along with ‚Äú\[OP\] is chump change.‚Äù Sara and Dylan started leaving old food in the fridge, and Dylan would leave me notes saying to ‚ÄúClean your disgusting fridge, it‚Äôs not Sara‚Äôs job.‚Äù He also clogged the toilet while I was at class and left a note for me to, ‚ÄúCall facilities, it‚Äôs not Sara‚Äôs job.‚Äù I took pictures of all of this to show the RA, and she just said, ‚ÄúSorry, but you know how Dylan is.‚Äù Then, Dylan would use Sara‚Äôs card to come into my dorm between 2 and 4am every night to turn on the lights, the shower, flush the toilet, and leave. I‚Äôd have to get up and turn everything off. Sometimes he‚Äôd come in twice. This happened for about 2 weeks before I got fed up and reported him to campus police.

Once the report was filed and Dylan‚Äôs punishment was given, Sara said we had to talk. Apparently, she was also punished since Dylan used her card. Her punishment was a 2-day safety refresher. Dylan‚Äôs was a 6 week safety course and breaking and entering was put on his file. Sara said I shouldn't have let things get this far and that I should‚Äôve talked to him. I said I wasn‚Äôt comfortable because he had been a jerk to me before, and I felt backed into a corner. She said I wasn‚Äôt fair for reporting him because she didn‚Äôt know what he was doing, and his safety course would run through midterms and cause him extra work.

A friend I talked to today took Sara‚Äôs side. I‚Äôm more mature now and would handle the drama differently, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the AH for reporting him for breaking in. So AITA for reporting him?

738,AITA for not letting my roommate sleep with my dog?,35,Asshole,34,hroqrm,1594852747.0,"My roommate (24M ) and I (24M) are 3rd year medical students. We have a big board exam coming up, so for the next 2 months we rented a cabin to isolate from the world and study. Dad came to check up on us and since he‚Äôs been busy, he decided to drop off my dog Kevin. Kevin is very low maintenance so this was no problem. Kevin is a pretty playful, small dog. He sleeps most of the day as we study and he just enjoys the company of another hooman to his side. 

Anyway. Ever since Kevin showed up, my roommate has been taking a rather proactive role taking care of him. My roommate usually wakes up earlier than me, so he‚Äôd take Kevin out for his morning walk and would feed him before I even wake up. Furthermore, he picks Kevin up, curls him up like a baby, kisses him and starts impersonating silly conversations with him. This isn‚Äôt anything weird to me because I do the same. Thought i found it to be strange  because my dog doesn‚Äôt really know my roommate like that, so I didn‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôd become so attached to Kevin. The tipping point came when I entered my roommates room one night, and found him with my dog passed out and cuddling in bed. It was both funny, confusing, and a bit infuriating. 

The next morning after they had come back from the morning walk, I had a convo with roommate where I explained to him that while I am very grateful and appreciative for helping out with my dog and for always being so nice to him, I didn‚Äôt condone of him being so close to the dog. I told him they could play etc but not sleep together. My roommate said ok and that he was sorry. He told me he‚Äôd always wanted a dog and that his parents had deprived him of that opportunity as they wouldn‚Äôt allow one in their home. 

I told my girlfriend, who also knows my roommate well as we are all in the same medical class, the conversation that just  had occurred. The backlash that ensued was just... bad. She told me my roommate and his gf had just broken up before we even begun the isolation. She also told me that I was being a childish, jealous POS and that my roommate could probably have used Kevin for some emotional support. She then told other people in our group of friends who also blew up my phone telling me I was also a POS. 

At this point, my roommate started studying in his room with the door closed so that Kevin doesn‚Äôt go in. While I do feel like the asshole, part of me feels that I was looking for both their best interests by not letting them be so closely attached to one another. We‚Äôre eventually going to part ways in a few weeks.

739,AITA for telling my brother he's being a manipulative AH?,29,Not the A-hole,19,hrnegr,1594847964.0,"Brother - ""Joe""

GF - ""Sara""

My brother Joe (18M) and Sara (18F) have been dating for around 7-8 months. They seem compatible and get along well - we're not best friends or anything, but she's very sweet. 

Joe and I are fairly into memes; making references, sharing them over WhatsApp, etc. (Before anyone comments on this, I'm not here for judgement about how ""cringey"" meme culture is  - just roll with it) and a running joke in the family/friend-circle is to gently make fun of anyone who doesn't get a reference. ""F to pay respects? What does that mean?"" 

*dramatic gasp* ""So uncultured!""

[proceeds to explain the joke] 

I know it sounds stupid, but it's just a thing we tend to do sometimes if we're in the right situation (read: with friends and people we know). 

Sara was video-chatting to Joe the other day and referenced a meme (or YT video or something) and Joe didn't get the reference. So Sara, being privy to the little silly trend, gasped theatrically and said, ""you uncultured swine, you! It's [popular YouTuber]!"" It was very obviously a friendly joke, she was in no way being serious or commenting on our upbringing or ""class"" or anything, and was just playing on our inside joke. 

Joe, still on the phone, quietly left the room and went up to his bedroom. A while later, having hung up, he swaggered back downstairs and proudly announced that he'd ""sorted out the situation"". He explained that he ""refused to be called uncultured by Sara"" and that she had ""no right to comment on his cultural knowledge"". Basically, he let her know that he'd ""put her in her place"" (not my words) and told her that a breakup was on the horizon if she EVER commented on this kind of thing again. She'd apologised and promised to never do it again. 

My dad congratulated him on ""setting reasonable boundaries"" and I'm standing there like‚Ä¶ ""what. The. Fuck."" Sara was harmlessly playing on a known family joke, it was in no way a comment to be taken seriously. I told Joe that he had no right to police the way Sara talked, that she was being harmless and he can't take a fuckin joke, and that threatening someone with a breakup unless she conforms to his specific guidelines is manipulative af. ""If you do this again, I'm breaking up with you""? The fuck? And then he's PROUD of ""setting her straight""??? 

Joe said he was right to set boundaries. I agree, but told him that threatening someone with separation is not the way to do that, especially when it was a joke. He responded by telling me that it was his relationship and I had absolutely no right to storm in and tell him how to manage it. I'm a little conflicted - he's right that it's not mine to handle, and my parents agreed that I should stay out of it. Yeah, he does have a right to set boundaries and let her know what he's comfortable with. That's not the issue. It's the way he went about it that was manipulative and borderline abusive.",False,False,2020-07-15 14:19:24

I picked my seminar, the only one I found interesting, and waited all morning for my registration window to book my spot, which worked out and I got a spot.

Now recently my college declared that our classes will be in person for the most part but that students can choose to do remote learning if they want to. This had been perfectly fine and hadn't affected me at all until today, when I got an email about my seminar class.

This email said my seminar class moved to a remote setting because these classes are larger than normal and they want to reduce the spread of germs in classrooms. I was totally okay with being moved online, it doesn't adversely affect my schedule and I still get to take that specific class. 

However, they then asked for me to consider switching to a different seminar on a different topic that would be in person so that my spot could go to a student who will be studying remotely so it is easier for everyone involved. I want to say no because this was the only seminar I was interested in and it was a first come first served set-up to get into that class. But, I also feel a little guilty for anyone that is studying remotely that will need special measures for them to take a seminar offered in person as opposed to remotely.

So, AITA for not changing to a different seminar?

My bio mom is severely mentally I‚Äôll and has been my entire life. She was constantly in and out of mental health facilities my childhood. My step mom is stuck up and wanted my dad but not his baggage and has never treated me kindly. So my MIL is the closest thing I have to an actual mother figure in my life. I‚Äôve been with my husband just shy of a decade. Our two families are WORLDS apart. His family are extremely tight nit and are always there for one another where my family all just kind of love their own lives and aren‚Äôt very involved with one another.

My daughter is 5 and has had one haircut in her whole life (before today) and that was over a year ago. Her hair was to her butt. Not for any particular reason other than COVID-19 has literally ruined us financially and I refuse to take my kids out to public places right now like the salon or grocery store. I‚Äôve been saying for a couple of weeks now that I was going to try and cut it myself. I am a huge fan of Brad Mondo and felt like I could do it without making it crazy uneven. It‚Äôs been in the 80‚Äôs-90‚Äôs and my poor baby girl has been miserable with all of that hair in this heat.

744,AITA for not paying the rest of June‚Äôs rent?,29,Not the A-hole,21,hornzx,1594426059.0,"I was subletting a den (living area without a door) from January until April. The girl I was living with was pretty terrible. She did a lot of coke, she had old men coming in and out, she liked to say she was a sugar baby but she just seemed more like a prostitute, but I digress
Living here wasn‚Äôt that great for my mental health. Especially since I didn‚Äôt have a door or wall separating myself. It got worse when covid hit because then we were forced to quarantine together, she just didn‚Äôt. She‚Äôd have friends, men and even went on a trip in the beginning. 

Anyway, her original roommate (her brother) was supposed to move back in April and I was supposed to move on. April came and he told her last minute that he didn‚Äôt want to come back yet. Even though I hated living with her I felt bad for her, there was no way she‚Äôd be able to afford it her self so I said I‚Äôd stay until he was coming back or if I found a place I couldn‚Äôt pass. I explained I wanted a lease or some written agreement, that way he couldn‚Äôt just come back one day and kick me out. 
I never got one, they basically wanted me to just stick around until the day he randomly decided to come back. 

Mid May her brother says he‚Äôs coming back at the end of June, I said fine and found my self a bachelor. Well I signed and my move day was scheduled for the 13th. Two days before I moved her and her brother got into a fight when he again said he‚Äôd not be returning. 
At this point there‚Äôs nothing I could do, I signed and paid first and last of my own place. 
I paid her the rent that was owed for the 2 weeks that I stayed and I moved as planned. 

Now she‚Äôs hounding me because she wants me to pay rent for the second half of the month of which I did not live there anymore. 
I‚Äôm not legally obligated to, as I‚Äôm not on the lease‚Äî despite me asking for one multiple times. 
I don‚Äôt see why I should have to pay that rent, I already stayed 2.5 months over our first agreement, basically as a favour until they could sort out their issues. Neither one of them bothered looking for a roommate in the event I left. 
They were aware I was moving and when, it wasn‚Äôt a secret. 

Not to mention, the day after I moved my things she had me drop off my keys to the flat and told me if I forgot anything I needed I‚Äôd have to ask before I could get it. 
She also turned the living area into an office area not even a day later. 

Why would I pay rent for a space I don‚Äôt even have access to? 
I‚Äôm I the asshole for dodging her request for payment? Is paying for the entire month the right thing to do? 

I know she can‚Äôt afford to pay it, but in my opinion her brother should be the one coughing up that money. 
It‚Äôs about $650, who knows how much she is actually short though‚Äî as I suspect the price is lower than that. I‚Äôve known for a while she was over charging me about $200/month anyway.

746,AITA for wanting to keep politics out of my relationship with my dad,27,Not the A-hole,10,hqnsl0,1594703143.0,"So I (20F) and my sister (24F) have had a strained relationship with my father ever since he divorced my mom about 8 years ago. Two of my three other siblings have basically cut ties with my dad completely. As much as my dad pisses my sister and I off, we don't want to have a nonexistent relationship with our father. 

Recently me, my sister, my dad, and my dad's new wife have been discussing how we can create a healthy relationship between us. One of the more significant points of contention between us is politics, a topic that my sister and I can never seem to agree on with my dad. As a result, my sister suggested that we make politics an off limit topic. However, my dad and his wife ardently refuse to agree to those terms. They claim that talking about politics allows us to ""gain a deeper understanding of each other"" and that ""there is no way we can have a relationship with forbidden topics"". 

To me, any political talk with my father is detrimental to the relationship. When I hear him express certain opinions that I find to be abhorrent, it only serves to diminish my opinion of him and make me not want to spend any time around him.  I know of people who have made politics an off limit topic with certain family members and it has worked out fine, so I don't see why my dad thinks it's so outlandish for me and my sister to suggest it.

Last night I worked a little later than my normal shift. We watched some TV and it was time for him to go to bed. My job is stressful and it takes me awhile to unwind. I wasn't ready when he was, so I went into the living room to watch TV.

When he woke up this morning, he complained he didn't fall asleep until I came to bed about an hour/hour and a half later. I told him that he needs to find a solution that isn't me lying there and flopping around endlessly because that would keep him awake, too.

I was telling a friend about it, and she said I should've just laid there until he fell asleep and then left. I sacrifice a lot when it comes to sleep when he is home because he's home so little (he prefers sleeping in the nude, I do not. He prefers no lights, I don't like the dark.)

748,AITA for denying my neighbours to get a terrace?,28,Not the A-hole,27,hp6hlc,1594484185.0,"Hello!

We (husband, son and I) live in an apartment house where we own an apartment on the ground floor, so we have a big garden with a terrace. Two years ago, we decided to get a canopy for our terrace. We needed permission from all owners of the house, everybody gave it to us and we built it, it was no big deal at all.

Now our upstairs neighbours Alex and Betty are unsatisfied with their own living situation. They have a small balcony but they want to spend more time outside on a bigger terrace. Yesterday, we were having a little barbecue (some neighbours and friends) and Betty shows up with some kind of construction plan - they would like to build their own terrace on top of our canopy. I laughed a little because I thought they were joking tbh but they were completely serious. They even talked about it with other neighbours to get their permission for it and some already gave it to them.

For me, it's clear that I won't let that happen. First of all, it's our canopy which we built with our material and our money. Secondly, it would creat a big platform in the middle of our garden. They could see us the whole time, it would take so much of our privacy away. And last but not least - they would need to get some serious construction work done which would impact us a lot because basically everything would need to go throughout our garden and I have no intention of living with that, even if it's only for a couple of days/weeks.

So I told them no and argued with all these reasons. Alex tried to talk me into it but I'm not going to change my opinion. I then made a comment of how they should just move if they want a terrace so badly, after that Betty stormed off and Alex followed which left our little barbecue with a super weird atmosphere for the rest of the night.

My husband thinks I was a little too harsh and that I should at least look at the plans but I'm not going to let their plan happen just because they bought an apartment they don't like.

A few days ago was his birthday and I wished him a Happy Birthday and he never responded. Then I found out he rented a Lake House and invited all of his friends except me. I‚Äôm too scared to call him out on it now.

So instead, today I invited to drive him to a free birthday dinner, but I actually drove to the Lake House where he had his party.

All units have patios (20 ft long x 6 ft wide). Management changes have led to little enforcement of rules. People in garden units are spreading out past the patio, putting items on the grass. Our by-laws don't give more space to garden units or allow for the modification of common areas and grounds. I've never asked the condo board about this, but it bothers me and I think it's a huge liability. 

My neighbor Steve put a picnic table/umbrella on the grass past his patio and changed the landscape. It sits in the water line of the building. Last summer, I asked about it and he said it was ""temporary"" so it was fine. I disagreed, but let it go.

We say hi sometimes, but we're not friendly. He and his wife have older kids (college age at home) and we have elementary kids. Over the past 4 years we've had a few issues where he's reprimanded my kids for playing outside (like 7:00 pm on a summer weekend).  But the main issue was 2 years ago. Steve came up on a Sunday at 9:30 am. My kids opened the door and I was in the bathroom, husband was working. I came out to him in my unit scolding my kids. He wasn't apologetic and thought kids were alone and that he had every right to do what he did.

Currently, I have a basket on my railing (which is allowed). It drains onto Steve's umbrella/table. I water my plants between 7 pm - 8 pm.  Last night, Steve was sitting at his table. I can't see him. He got up and said my plants were wet enough since he was getting wet. I responded that they had to be soaked through and that his table didn't belong there anyway.  

He told me that ""no one put a g\*n to my head"" to buy a second floor unit and that he gets 11 feet of space past his patio and that his table is temporary. I asked him to not be an a-hole in front of my daughter. Telling him talking about violence was extreme. I told him that everyone does what they want here and I've said nothing, so he can move when I water my plants. I also told him that if he does own the space then I'd like to see the paperwork, agreed upon by our association, including signatures and dates it was voted in.  If I'm wrong, then prove it.

I am trying to create a balanced list that includes 3 safety schools, but I am struggling to find safety schools that I like (I have 2/3 so far). The 3rd safety school that I like is one that my sister is very interested in, and she thinks that if we both apply I'll be accepted instead of her. I do have a higher GPA and test scores than she does, and I go a more academically rigorous school (which she transferred out of since she couldn't stand the stress). That said, she does have extracurriculars that the college values, while mine are likely less attractive to the school, so I'm not entirely sure I would be the preferred candidate.

Additionally, we have both had fairly equal opportunities in life, and I believe the onus is on her to have made choices that would help her get into college, not on me to step aside for her. While she has mental health struggles, she also has accommodations for them. She claims I'm just ""smarter than her"", which I don't think is true. What I do know to be true is that I have largely sacrificed my social life and worked extraordinarily hard to get the grades and scores I have, and I feel I should be able to reap the benefits of those choices. She and my parents think that this belief is callous, and I should be more compassionate.  They also point out that this college is a safety school for me, and if I get in somewhere else more selective, I won't go there anyway. Moreover, she and my parents keep telling me I won't fit in at this school since I'm too much of a square, (my words, not theirs, but I didn't want to give too many identifying details about the school). Conversely, this school is one of my sister's top choices. My sister also holds that I am showing interest in this college just to spite her, and I don't actually want to go there. I disagree with this opinion, as there are lots of aspects that I like about the school, and I am having trouble finding other safety schools I like as much.

I signed up for a virtual information session today, which hurt my sister's feelings. I don't think she has anything to worry about. After all, if she's right about me not fitting in, I'll lose interest in the school anyway. I also feel like I have the right to investigate any college I would like to, regardless of her interest in it. I will add that she often makes negative comments about other schools on my list (they're so preppy, high pressure, serious, etc.). It often feels like I'm stuck between Scylla and Charybdis as I can't go to a college she likes because she's interested in it, but if I go to a college she dislikes, she'll judge me for it.

We hadn't booked any venues or made deposits so no major losses there. It was a bit irresponsible for us to not have done so earlier but that's mostly because both us weren't equally enthusiastic about the whole process. 

I know women tend to be very excited about wedding planning but K hadn't even picked out a dress about almost month before the scheduled wedding and neither had we been able to finalise a guest list because she wasn't sure which people from her rather small social circle to invite. Anyway, all of that got put on hold.

In our country cases are steadily dropping so during quarantine I suggested we should postpone to October and reduce it to a close friends and family only event. I had even made a deposit at my cousin's event hall. I made the guest list on my own, talked to caterers on my own, picked out the invites on my own. She seemed very disinterested throughout and agreed to everything without even opening the binder I had made for her.

Then last week she said out of the blue that we should ""get a courthouse wedding and get over with it"". I was obviously crushed but I thought hey maybe she wanted this all along and that's why she was uninterested. We agreed and she booked an appointment for the next Sunday. She also didn't want any other people there, just us. I figured we could have a reception later but she just nodded at that.

Because our wedding got fast tracked I had to pick an outfit quickly. I showed the tux to her and (I swear I am not kidding) she started laughing. She said there was no need to ""buy a tux for a courthouse wedding"". I mean, a wedding is a wedding, right? You pick out new clothes for the occasions you want to remember but she didn't seem to understand that. She then told me she wasn't gonna do that and wear a ""new dress"" (she has worn twice before to different events so no-one will notice it, according to her)

I really got mad at that. Her dress isn't even a gown and to me that feels like she doesn't want to be a bride or that our wedding is not that important of an occasion to her. She really blew up at that, saying I was overreacting. She then said she doesn't wanna get married if it's gonna ""be on my terms"".

A few of out mutual friends called me up and said I was being TA for ""micromanaging our wedding"" and ""controlling her choice of wedding dress"".

The youngest is 3 and a half and has my bigger structure. She goes outside, plays, has veggies and fruits for lunch and dinner, but still is on the thicker side. Her doctor isn't worried. It's likely she'll grow out of that baby weight. I suppose my only worry for my wife and I is just how food motivated she is. But again, she's 3! I don't want her to grow up thinking weight is something to obsess over and she isn't beautiful.

My wife's friend of several years, Ava we'll call for the sake of the story, is godmother of my daughter and spoils both kids. Ava isn't a person who censors herself no matter how awful or painful what she says is. It's been a reoccurring joke of hers to call my daughter the lil chunk and other nicknames that I hate. She's made a fair share of comments like I hope daughter gets into running or she's going to get tagged so easily on the playground and these are in front of my daughter. Obviously she doesn't completely understand, but I fear these comments will progress with age and my daughter will begin to hate herself because of Ava.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when Ava compared my youngest to my oldest daughter in terms of weight. She continued to go on and on about how different they were in weight it's like they weren't even sisters and my youngest was going to have to live in oldest's spotlight.

I wasn't nice when I kicked Ava out. I told her she wasn't allowed to set foot in my house age and see my daughter until she learns some goddamn manners. Ava, however, is my wife's only close friend. It's been difficult on her. I feel like an ass for hurting her in the process but I cannot stand that woman.

In the beginning everything was fine even though she told me she wasnt comfortable with us dating because she thought it was weird and going to cause problems. I ignored her requests because I was happy for the first time in a long time. I am an alcoholic and my alcohol habits caused a lot of problems. I was super touchy with her boyfriend and said a lot of things that shouldnt be said. This happened a few times. She forgave me twice but the 3rd time caused her to block me off everything after she said ""You act like you only started dating Jake so you could get closer to my boyfriend"". Untrue but justified, because of my actions. Then, my boyfriend left me and took her side. She didnt ask him to, he just did.

I started getting help after this and my drinking has slowed. Small progress. My ex reached out and said he wanted to work on us and wanted me to come back home. I told him I would if he didnt have her around me. He flipped out and said if anything I should be asking him to not have his brother around me because after all, I was the one hitting on his brother and my cousin was 100% justified in being upset about it.

I really thought they'd have gotten the hint but my husband has even asked them multiple times to just text to let us know they're coming so I can be properly dressed. 
Since then they've come over 7 or 8 times and only texted twice.
I made a passive aggressive remark once and my husband has kindly but firmly reminded them multiple times but they just keep doing it. 

At this point I feel like I just have to drop it and be prepared to jump up and change at any moment but it makes me mad that they can't grant us this one courtesy. Especially when my husband and I are the ones caring for his mother.

768,AITA for feeling jealous of my daughter?,28,Asshole,35,hqdh6e,1594667936.0,"First, this is a disposable account because my daughter follows me on my other account, also English is not my first language, I regret the errors.

By context I had my oldest daughter (18) when my current boyfriend and I were very young, I had many miscarriages for years, until in 2018 I got pregnant with my second daughter (it was a very complicated pregnancy, I was in bed all
the pregnancy and my daughter was born with 7 months). At the beginning of 2019, we had to move to Europe for work reasons and our schedules were very complicated. I work from 11 am to 8:30 pm and my boyfriend from 6 am to 6 pm.

My oldest daughter has taken the responsibility of taking care of our baby, without complaining.
When she has classes, our baby goes to a kindergarten when I go to work and my daughter picks her up as soon as she leaves high school. Now that it's vacation, I let my oldest daughter sleep until I leave.
My oldest daughter is doing an amazing job, she cooks for her and her sister, she cleans the whole house thoroughly every day, she plays with her sister and she is raising her very well. When my boyfriend comes home, my daughter understands that her father is very tired, and she takes her little sister and takes her to the park until I return home and then it is her time to rest.

My feelings of jealousy started last week, when they gave me ""vacations"" (I only have to go to work two days a week), being more at home, I realized ... that my baby no longer sees me as his mother , she sees her older sister as her mother, she doesn't want me to feed her, she has to be her sister, I can't make her take a nap, her sister has to put her to sleep, she gets upset if I want to play with her, but she goes and look for his sister to play. If I'm giving her a bath, she stays very still and expressionless, but if it's her sister who bathes her, she can't stop laughing and playing. She doesn't obey me at all, but she obeys her sister, I even feel that she loves her father more than me.

All this, to trigger that I treated my older daughter in a bad way, I did not realize that she did it, but she was very abrupt, not very affectionate and cold with her. I didn't realize I was acting this way, until my boyfriend caught my attention for this and told me that he was being an asshole.
Am I being a fool for feeling this way?

Edit: I am going to clarify a couple of things, when I got pregnant with our second daughter, at that time we had a good economic situation and we worked most of the time at home, in addition to having the rest of our family. Secondly, in our country of origin you cannot have a legal abortion, so if you got pregnant you should have it (the thing is, we thought it would be impossible to get pregnant again, that's why we want a lot when you accidentally get pregnant). I feel that things would be very different if we had not moved, but the move was a very fast situation and we did not have many options, that screwed us up a bit.",False,1594642758.0,2020-07-13 12:18:56

 Yesterday I 22F was out with two of my cousins 19F & 25F, and two other girls.

Naturally, I was like ""okay"" and just walked back home by myself.

I wouldn't say I live in a bad area, but being alone at 1am on a Tuesday night is still very dangerous, I was getting cat called every step I took, guys in cars were pulling over and honking for me to get in (I guess?) and I couldn't see any other girls except for a couple of night workers.

774,AITA for voting against a hike for executives.,23,Not the A-hole,20,hr4kdk,1594772562.0,"&#x200B;

Hi Everyone, 

\[sincere apologies for any grammatical errors, but please feel free to correct them.\]

I am a 24-year-old, unmarried man in a senior position in an office. 

COVID has largely changed how we function as an organization. Our sales have been affected in ways similar to everyone else's and the initial days were hard.

This meant we had to postpone the bonuses meant to arrive in March because it is important to keep the ship sailing and rightfully so. 

In April end, we decided to postpone the hike for employees so that we could convert our interns to full-time employees, because that felt more important and letting them go might mean they are unemployed for a good year, at least. 

I have been pro to these decisions and my arguments were aggressively for these decisions, which have gathered a bit of negative attention towards me from some senior employees in the company. 

Today, we took up the hike for employees again after we've started seeing some traction in business as the new normal has started settling in. My argument was to give hike, if possible, to employees in the mid-tier but hold out on the senior management including myself. 

The reason being the fact that with the last hike I received, I could actually hire a full-time employee for the firm, but it wouldn't cost so much to give a hike to the mid employees. 10% of what it costs to give me a hike is (way) more than 10% of giving a mid employee a hike. I also added that I think they'd need it more than me because their expenses would have increased with the change in lifestyle and we might already be having that lifestyle. Like good internet connections, good setups to work from, arrangements for shopping, and all. 

Many think I am being selfish as I am single and have no responsibilities, thus I do not need money. They have kids, and if I had them too, I wouldn't have been so biased. I think it almost got to a point where the moderator had to mute the call.

I got a couple of messages saying I shouldn't just think about myself the whole time and I should think of everyone else too and that I am a selfish asshole. 

I did think of them too, in a very limited thought. Maybe, if I was okay at 24, they should be very well-off being in their late 30's and 40's. I mean it is a reasonable assumption to make, I guess? You know, for people in my/equivalent position being better that you financially with the age?

I made a vote that was sensible to me, but I think I am losing some powerful friends with the move. This would probably/(definitely) affect my career. 

So, AITA?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I am no saint. Love and need money as much as everyone else does. Thought I did not need it as much as regular employees did at the moment. Hence disagreed with the choice of giving a hike to senior management. Did not side with the argument of the majority. Did not hide the reason for the opinion. Is being called a selfish AH.

775,AITA for refusing to attend my cousin's wedding or give him money?,25,Not the A-hole,50,hqsv6v,1594721348.0,"On my mobile, sorry for bad formatting. Also English is not my first language so apologies for any spelling errors.

For a bit of background, in my culture if you're unable or unwilling to attend a wedding you give a sum of money instead, the amount usually depends on how close you are to the person getting married.

My cousin, let's call him John, is getting married in a few months (covid permitting) and he has invited my parents as well as me and my brother. 

While normally this wouldn't pose much of a dilemma, as I mentioned before, I either go or send him money, I refuse to do either and my family is saying that I might be overreacting.

Me, John and my brother, let's say Alex, were really close growing up and used to spend a lot of time together. In our teenage years we drifted apart slightly, but would still occasionally get together to see a film or have a game and pizza night.

Me and Alex lived away from our parents during school weeks and we had our own flat which we left unoccupied on weekends and long holidays when we went home to our parents, as we were still minors. We would have these get together at our flat, sometimes John was invited.

After one if these evenings, when John was the only attendee, Alex noticed he couldn't find his keys, but figured he left them at school in his locker and didn't think much of it. Shortly after that we had a long weekend from school for Easter so we went to our parents' to celebrate and relax. When we came back, we noticed that both our laptops, 2 of my watches and cash were missing from the flat so we called our parents who immediately called the police.

Upon checking the cameras in the building police saw John coming in, using Alex's ""lost key"" and leaving with a heavy load an hour later.

Upon hearing this, my parents decided not to press charges as to not ruin his future, but they contacted his parents who were upset with him, but made no effort to recover these goods or have him pay us back. It turned out that he had already sold the laptops and the watches he gave to these 2 girls he was seeing at that time. 

I had a hard time recovering all the work that was on that laptop, I had a few final papers and notes for my final highschool exams that I had spent months making and organising and that was a horribly stressful time for me. I still haven't forgotten that he did this to us, after he was welcomed in our home and we treated him like one of us.

Going to this wedding would not only mean that I show I got over this, but would involve me  spending money to fly abroad, as I moved away for university, buy a new dress, and give money to the wedding anyway, as tradition asks. I simply refuse to spend time and money on him and my family says I should just forgive and forget and not destroy family bonds over a couple of laptops.

Tl;dr My cousin stole some laptops watches and cash from my flat a few years ago and I am still upset and refusing to be involved with his wedding.

He also pointed out that our older brother (23) seems to experience the same struggle of struggling to communicate and having a short temper. I gently mentioned that it's sometimes a side effect of emotional abuse and he asked if that's what our mom is doing in talking over and silencing the 11 year old. Before I could form a response, he got called away to go to an appointment. 

I know that not all kids have the same experiences despite growing up in the same household, so despite my observations, I don't want to assume that my brothers feel abused or have experienced the same abuse I have. I want to sit the 16yo - and possibly the 11yo as well - down and teach them the signs and effects of abuse so they can decide for themselves if they've been abused. This has the potential for them to decide that yes, our parents are abusers, and for there to be repercussions for their relationships.

777,AITA for poorly tipping my waitress?,27,Not the A-hole,59,hqjb6x,1594689042.0,"I'll start off with I live in america so tipping for services is customary.

Tldr: I usually tip at least 20% but I felt like this time I shouldnt because the service made me feel uncomfortable.

Full version: My small town got a new local diner. So my boyfriend(20m) and i(19f) decided to give it a shot.
They've been open for about 2 months and I've heard mixed reviews about it. The menu book was about 6 pages long so it took me a while to figure out where everything was.
I ordered a Dr. Pepper, and boyfriend ordered pepsi. 
The waitress brought me water on accident so I awkwardly asked for my soda instead. No big deal she could have just forgotten what I asked for because she had 3 other tables.
The next issue I had was I ordered pancakes, scrambled eggs, and 2 biscuits.
I was brought pancakes, appleslices, and a salad. My boyfriends order was correct.
I awkwardly asked the waitress to fix my order and responded with, ""are you SURE that's what you want?"" 
I said ""no, nevemind."" Then no longer felt hungry so I picked at the food I ended up with just boxing it up and will probably throw it away. I head her asking other tables if they would like to order dessert and i decided brownie pie sounded good and would make me feel better so I was going to order some.
But she just brought our receipt to the table and left it so I decided against that too.
The bill came up to $36 but I only tipped $2.
Boyfriend got mad at me and said I was an asshole because even crappy service deserves to be paid.
I left and went to work but I've been feeling more and more like I over reacted.
I am plus size, not obese but I'm not average, so to me it felt like she was trying to force me to make the healthier choices so it felt like I didn't belong there. I dont plan on going back, but AITA for not tipping decent, or was the waitress out of line?",False,False,2020-07-13 18:10:42

While I was in the kitchen my mom was making lunch for our family so we were each doing our own thing.

 When we all sat down to eat, me with my own sandwich and my parents with their food, my mom told me that when I was making my sandwich I should have asked my parents if I should make one for both of them too. 

I told her that I was just making my breakfast since I woke up late, plus they already had their own lunch so I didn't think they'd want a sandwich too. 

I was confused because why couldn't they just ask me to make them sandwiches while I was making it instead of berating me AFTER I already made the sandwich? I can't read their minds, how was I supposed to know they wanted a sandwich too? Am I supposed to ask my parents if they want food every single time I make myself a snack or a meal? 

My mom's response was that she always makes meals for the entire family in mind, not just herself, and that I should have done the same. But if she made her own meal and didn't make food for everyone I wouldn't be upset at all because she has no obligation to do so, it's not her job to cater to us. If she made lunch for herself I would just go and make my own separate meal, no big deal. 

However I feel like maybe I did something wrong because both my mom and dad were pretty upset (my dad especially) and I would like to know why they're upset as I can't seem to understand.

This surprised me (24M) bc he is usually a goody two shoes and follows my parents strict rules. He's never been high and has had a couple sips of alcohol (mostly with me his big bro).

Thing is, I'm not totally against it. My wife and I have edibles and I'm thinking about offering him some while he's here. Better him get high with people that know and love him than some sketch or peer pressure situation.. but that aside, here's my thought process:

1. I don't want to push my morality on him. I've grown and changed a lot since I left home and hope for many of the same changes for him but I always am cautious
2. I do think he could use some maturing and that includes letting him make decisions for himself (my parents control a lot of his life ie a total app & internet lock on his phone, no social media, etc.)
3. My bro tends to have loose lips so I definitely couldn't count on him keeping a secret. Besides I would never want him to lie on my behalf bc I'm the adult and I can take it.

So. Bottom line, getting high with him could be fun and a bonding experience. But also if my parents find out they would probably be pissed, and he still lives under their roof for 2 more years. WIBTA if I offer him edibles?

783,AITA for parking in front of some lady's house?,26,Not the A-hole,27,hphj66,1594529617.0,"This just happened like 30 minutes ago. I was helping a friend move today and it involved going to several different places that were each 10 to 30 minutes away from each other. The first place we went involved getting stuff from a trailer a mutual friend had let him use to house his stuff while he was in a small apartment. Now, in this neighborhood there is only street and driveway parking. The driveway parking was all full and so I had to park on the street. I park in front of the neighbor's house and make sure not to block the driveway or cover up the house number. After we finish loading up the U-Haul at this location, one of my friends whose truck is being used to carry larger items asks if I just want to carpool to the rest of the locations. I say sure because I really wanted to save gas and I get an opportunity to chat with an old friend. 

We finish picking up and unloading everything and then my friend drives me back to my car. This lady comes out as I'm about to pull away and asks if I live across the street. I say no and she then says, ""Next time don't park in front of my house."" I know that she doesn't know that I will never be coming back there, so I just say sorry and get ready to roll up my window to leave. She insists on saying, ""No sorry, next time I call the police,"" in the rudest, most threatening way possible.

This just really rubbed me the wrong way. I mean, it's street parking. There are cars all over and my car did nothing to her and wasn't blocking any sort of access to her house. I get if she didn't want someone parked in front of her house, so her first approach was fine, if a little extra. But she doesn't own the street. I was parked legally as far as I know so I don't get why she felt the need to further threaten me after I already apologized and was getting ready to leave.

But, I don't know. Sometimes when people get that angry about stuff I have to wonder if maybe I was in the wrong. So somebody please help me understand.",False,False,2020-07-11 21:53:37

I‚Äôm f23 and he‚Äôs m25. Together two years. 

I‚Äôm really passionate about makeup and mostly self-taught. I‚Äôd love to be a makeup artist and am planning on enrolling in cosmetology school next year if corona allows it. I do mostly beauty makeup, but I‚Äôve done some effects makeup for Halloween and cosplay before.

It‚Äôs been a side hustle of mine for a while. I‚Äôve done makeup for weddings, graduation photos, prom, other events. I charge pretty reasonably and have had good reviews. (And yes, I worked at Ulta before.)

I do practice looks on myself and friends to beef up my portfolio. My bf is a great sport and has let me do eye makeup on him before (he has really beautiful blue eyes and naturally long lashes) to put in my portfolio. Some of the shots are close ups of his eyes and some are headshots. He is not the only guy in my portfolio.

My portfolio used to be a physical ‚Äúlook-book‚Äù that I‚Äôd show to people, but I‚Äôve been working on my own website to be more professional and convenient. My bf‚Äôs pics are in there, six of them are of him out of 32 total pictures. 

I posted a link to my online portfolio on my Instagram and Twitter. I showed my bf the completed site (I‚Äôm proud of it) and he thought it was cool at first until he saw the pics of him. He got really upset and told me to take them down cause he didn‚Äôt want pics of him on makeup online.

I took them down but I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal. He said I should have asked first and was concerned about his friends or brothers seeing the pics (the only way they‚Äôd see them is if they went to my social media and clicked my portfolio link.) I feel bad that I freaked him out but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd see the pics. He never was concerned about it before and it‚Äôs just makeup.

789,AITA for telling my ex the truth about her weight?,23,Asshole,51,ho8qsb,1594349147.0,"  I \[20M\] recently broke up with my gf \[19\] of three years. We met in hs and now go to different colleges - she lives at home and I live away at school and have been long distance for a year and a half. There were lots of reasons why I found myself wanting to break up with her but a big one is that she put on weight, about 15-20 pounds in the past year. I'm not attracted to her anymore, and the sex wasn't as good for me. Plus we were just growing apart and there is a girl at my school I have started to like.

The thing is that she has had an eating disorder since before we met. She used to make herself throw up every day and would go long periods without eating. She always talked about hating herself and her body a lot. She was never super skinny, just normal weight. She never has gotten help for it and really we just don't talk about it. After knowing this about her for a while there was nothing to say, I couldn't do anything except try to make her feel better about herself by giving her compliments. I think the past year she has gone the opposite direction and started binging without throwing up, I don't really know. She also went on a new birth control that she thinks is making her gain weight but I know she eats a lot of junk food. I have tried to work out and eat healthy to motivate her and encourage her to do the same but it didn't work.

For the past couple months I have been pulling away, trying to figure out whether or not we could make it work, and she just asked more and more questions about why I was being distant. We have always been really open and honest with each other and maybe she felt I wasn't telling her everything. We talked and talked so much and she kept asking what was wrong so eventually I just admitted that I wasn't attracted to her anymore due to her weight gain. She said she knew that already and understood and would try to lose weight, but it was too late for me.

Now her best friend has contacted me saying I shouldn't have mentioned the weight because she's really upset. I know it must have been hard for her to hear but it was the truth and she wouldn't stop asking me why I was pulling away. She wasn't satisfied with any answers I gave her, and eventually it just wore me down until I told her the truth. Her friend is saying there was no reason I had to mention her weight and that I could have thought up other things to say. My ex also said something after we had that talk about how she always thought no one would ever want her bc she was fat but that I had always made her feel like maybe she was wrong, which made me feel bad but isn't my fault. I didn't put that idea in her head in the first place, and I'm sure someone out there will be into her her at the weight she is now, it's just not me.

I find her incredibly attractive and make my attraction to her known on a regular basis. The thing is, she is VERY insecure about her body. I've always been supportive and understanding, but lately it's started to become frustrating. The reason being is that it sometimes affects our dates and she also refuses to do anything to improve her insecurities. For example, she hates the way her legs look (even though objectively speaking she has an amazing body) and will never show them at all in public. Even in blistering heat she will wear jeans because she doesn't want anyone to see her legs. Now at the end of the day I'm not going to tell her what she can or can't wear but it does affect me sometimes too -- like when we go to the beach she won't wear a swimsuit and as a result can't swim in the water with me (something we used to do a lot when we first started dating). So often times when we go to the beach she'll just be sitting on the beach and if I go out to swim for too long she'll get mad that I left her by herself. 

She also always wants me to help her get in shape and I've offered countless times to work out with her (I play sports and lift regularly and have pretty good fitness knowledge) but it's like pulling teeth. Whenever I ask her to come work out with me she'll always make excuses not to and I have maybe a 1 in 5 chance of getting her to join... and then eventually when I give up, she'll ask me why I stopped trying to get her to work out with me!

Well, my aunt got pregnant in uni and thought that she could wait till she couldn‚Äôt abort it and then force my grandparents to look after it while she lived life to the full. Well, my grandparents shut this down quick when she tried to tell them what she has done. They suggested adoption or she has to drop out of school.

Aunt decided that this suggestion meant her parents would co-parent, or at least financial support her. I don‚Äôt even know what she thought, but she decided that she would never have to work a day in her life again, and dropped out. Well, when the baby was born, reality hit that her fantasies were false. 

She started collecting government checks, and with no help from her parents realised how deeply she fucked herself over. She moved into a 2 bed apartment, where she has been staying ever since.

My mom had the bright idea to start telling my how I had a lot of money saved up from chores, birthdays etc, and how I wouldn‚Äôt mind parting with them. I stood up, walked to the kitchen and told them my money wasn‚Äôt up for grabs.

Well, aunt started taking about how she is a hard working single mother and how I didn‚Äôt even work for any of it. She said that she needs it more and can put it to good use, and that we men have an obligation to help out woman and children in need, and be a role model for them. 

I told my aunt that I am a teenager not a boy, and that she is the least hard working single mother out there. She hasn‚Äôt worked a day in her life and if she thinks getting boned down by unknown men whilst collecting government money was an accomplishment, she has some loose screws.

Update #1: so after a deep dive on the internet trying to figure out if I should trust this employment my boyfriend found a go fund me page for a business that made a couple grand for a business that never got started last AUGUST from the same owner.  

Quick background: I started a job at a startup donut shop about a month ago, I went to the orientation and we were supposed to start baking training the next day, but there was a gas leak. I finally got in to work last week but none of my coworkers were there it was just me and the owner, and that aspect continues to confuse me because I have seen none of my coworkers since the orientation. There have been several instances where the owner has had no respect for my time and I can go into more details if there are questions but today left me more mad than I have ever been in my life. 

So that brings us to today, I got there at 4:00 in the morning to start training and when I got there she was still cleaning the deep fryer, to me this was an issue because on Thursday we had noticed that the fryer didn‚Äôt have the right parts to properly work and she stated that would be a priority over the weekend, and it was still BROKEN. And AGAIN I was the only one out of the 6 workers to show up. I spent the first 3 hours cleaning dishes, and around 7:00 she left to go get supplies because there still is barely any baking utensils there, and while she was gone she tasked me with sifting 20 lbs of powdered sugar, the first 8lbs took me OVER AN HOUR with the tools she had provided and my hands were CRAMPING, we finally got it all sifted and started making the glaze for donuts, and I was almost done adding the ingredients and it was like mud, the recipe was off, she had never made ANYTHING in a commercial kitchen before! We finally got it thinned out and it was about 30 minutes before I was scheduled to leave. 

I was scheduled to leave at 11 which would be less 7 hours so I wasn‚Äôt required a lunch break, but at 10:30 she says to me, hey I have to go to the next town over (which is 20 minutes away) and leaves me to clean up everything, there is powdered sugar EVERYWHERE, and she said she would be back ASAP, so I assume that she‚Äôll be back within the hour and I would just be 30 minutes late getting home, I clean all the dishes, clean all the surfaces, and mop, and 11:30 rolls around and I get a call saying she‚Äôs on her way back, I check the directions to the place she was at and it was a 20 minute drive so I figured okay no big deal it‚Äôs just 20 minutes I can wait because I have no way to lock up the store from the outside.

My dad/whole family has Covid. I was/am an essential worker I had a feeling I would bring it home eventually. My Dad had to be hospitalized.

My aunt blocked my on FB years ago because I am a Satanist and she is Christian. I try to be respectful of people though and will take measures so they aren't subjected to my stuff but she just blocked me rather than his message me and say that I was making her uncomfortable. Whatever. It didn't really bother me since I didn't want to see her stuff either.

The part that bothers me is that she has also blocked my mom and Dad for political differences,  well she heard via family that Dad was hospitalized so she unblocked me and started messaging me to ask about my dad. The first couple times I told her and encouraged her to message him directly as being stuck in the hospital he is bored and lonely. She messaged me again today and I again told her his status and then told her I was uncomfortable being the go between.

She said she didn't understand. I explained that if she had wanted us in her life then she shouldn't have blocked us and that I didn't have time to deal with Foul-weather friends/family that only turn up when something is wrong and that I didn't ask others about her because if I wanted It find a way to ask directly.

She told me that I was rude and that she just didn't like my posts but still cared about me and I told her that if she had cared about my life then she could have addressed her issue with me directly back then but she chose not to and its no my job to reconcile with her since she is 37 years my senior and all of this was due directly to her choices. She said she wouldn't bother me anymore but I kind of feel like an asshole now.

797,AITA for telling my aunt to stop posting conspiracy theories on Facebook?,22,Not the A-hole,19,hqdz50,1594670358.0,"My aunt recently shared a post on Facebook of someone saying that the nose swab for coronavirus testing was just an excuse for scientist to implant us something and the post encouraged people not to get tested. The post used arguments that are true on their own, such as saying that you can do a mouth swab a get a full DNA copy, so they did not think the nose swab was necessary and that you should be able to screen for the virus with a cheek swab. And while this is true, this does not serve as an argument to say they must be implanting something. 

Me and my sister called her out on her post saying she shouldn‚Äôt be posting this since it‚Äôs just to promote fear and that it will prevent people from getting tested. Which is the only way that the pandemic has managed to get under control in some countries by helping assess the appropriate measures. I also explained to her the reason for a nose swab was to get a more representative sample of your respiratory system and not only the virus that has been trapped by your mouth or nasal hairs. I shared a link showing all the different methods that people are developing to screen for the virus and highlighted that the nose swab is not the only one, but the most accurate at the moment. She went on to defend her post on the basis of previous information inconsistencies about the virus. I acknowledge that there‚Äôs a lot of misinformation but posts like her just add to that. 

The Facebook discussion finished and I received a call from my mum who‚Äôs been receiving calls from all the family saying that we had started a whole family drama. With some people supporting us and some people saying we were assholes for publicly calling her out. My mum ended calling my aunt, who cried saying that she never expected such betrayal from us and that we made her look dumb with her fb contacts, some of which called her up to say she was humiliating herself and was dumb. My aunt later sent us a Facebook photo saying something along the lines of ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like a post, don‚Äôt comment, like or share, just carry on with your life and let everyone live theirs‚Äù

My intention was never to insult her but to inform her and make people see how illogical these conspiracy theories are and to encourage critical thinking and reducing fake news. I believe people should not stay quiet in moments of discomfort and controversy. 
Maybe it would have been better to send her a private message saying she was being irrational, but at the moment I didn‚Äôt think of that. I also think she should be responsible for what she posts and that I‚Äôm not responsible of other people calling her dumb.

The thing is, a few years ago, I wasn't in a great place and she was aware of it,  but she still made my life absolute hell (bullying and intentional humiliation to make herself look better in-front her friends) and she's never apologised properly, just tried to buy my forgiveness with food and clothing. Because of that, I've (pettily I admit) never really forgiven her and just kept my distance from her when she visits home or when we went out for family outings.

But, with this whole lockdown happening, she's begun showing clear distress and my mother is very concerned, and thinks that since we're siblings, I can provide some form of support she can't. But, I have both subtly and explicitly told her I have no interest in seeing her, and my mother has continuously criticised me that I should be more worried and offering a support line since she's my sister and she's looked out for me when I was in a bad place, even though she didn't.

Usually what people comment doesn't haunt me, but for some reason I'm starting to doubt my grudge holding and if I should start putting an effort to help her out, even if she did hurt me.

I don't know her very well, but I was still there to help her move since we had mutual friends. Anyway, during the move, she mentioned that the only thing she didn't have was a vacuum cleaner.

About a week after that, my friends decided to throw her a housewarming party and also celebrate her birthday at the same time, because her birthday was a few days after we moved her in. I had the perfect gift, I have an expensive Bissell vacuum cleaner ($200) that she could use, since she specifically said she needed a vacuum cleaner. I was planning on getting a new (even better) vacuum cleaner soon, I make about $40,000 a year even though I didn't go to college, which means I also don't have any college debt. So this was no problem for me.

But what WAS a problem was when I took my old vacuum cleaner over to the party. I didn't have the original box, but I put a bow on it and it was in GREAT condition. Everyone was confused, so I revealed that it was my birthday gift to the friend and told her how much it was. I didn't get the reaction I was expecting, my friends even laughed. I thought she was being ungrateful but I was getting the cold shoulder for the rest of the party and felt like I was out of place.

On top of that, I STILL left the vacuum cleaner there for her, AND it was the most expensive gift she got (she was getting $20 gift cards, some plants, things like that). I'm trying really hard not to judge her because I still don't know her well. She's not poor, her new house isn't bad and she's not married.

Since then, she has worked numerous part time jobs, but always has a problem with those jobs and quits.  

Around the house, she either refuses to do any work, or has to be told numerous times to do a chore.  Her go to excuse for not doing chores is that she works and is too busy.  We're lucky if she does the dishes once or twice a month(we have a dishwasher).  She also provides zero financial support to my wife and I.

She has her own student loans which are approximately 700 a month for her. But she is also financially irresponsible and just bought a Cadillac as well as my parents owning a motorcycle and a boat and a rental property (that doesn't make a profit yet). 

She took out the Parent Plus loans when I was in college thinking that she could transfer them to me as a federal loan with income based repayment plans and federal protections when I graduated. We've realized this isn't possible and the only way to get it off of her name is for me to refinance it in my name with a private lender, meaning I would lose all of the protections I thought I'd have when I graduated. 

Just as well if I refinance with a private loan, I won't be able to qualify for student loan forgiveness for this parent plus loan (97k). I also have 38k in my own name from student loans. 

My mom makes 120k a year and my dad makes 80k a year. I'm barely clearing 40k a year.

I've been best friends with him and his family since I was 9 years old.  His parents call me their Son.  I've been with them through thick and thin.  They've supported me when my life seemed to be pulled out from under me.  I was there with the family when his brother started using.  I was there when he started ODing and there when being revived.  I've been with them through it all.  I would do anything for them.  They are my family and I considered the deceased a brother of mine.  A true brother, not just a good friend.  Unfortunately his most recent OD resulted in his death and his Wake is coming up.  I told the family point blank that I would do anything I could for them.  I set up a GoFundMe in their name (with permission) to help alleviate any financial stress, as they've been a shining light in our community for before I was born.

The issue right now is that they've explicitly told me that they don't want to see a 'single fuc\*\*ing person' that he used with.  They don't want to see anybody that helped him get drugs.  They don't want to see a single person that was using with him when he passed.  I unilaterally said of course, I would act as an impromptu bouncer to anyone that fits that description. 

We grew up in a small-ish town.  I knew all his friends.  I knew who he used with.  I knew who was there when he passed.  I know who got clean and left that life behind.  I already know who's not allowed in.  

I was pretty certain I would be able to uphold this promise but when I spoke about it with our other best friends I started receiving comments about not being the authority on who gets to grieve his death.  I've been told it's a pretty shitty thing to tell someone they're not allowed at someone else's wake, and normally I would agree, but I promised his family I would do so.  I promised **my** family I would do so.

I'm emotionally torn, I know in my heart what I'm going to do, and that's protect the emotions of my grieving family, but I really want to know if I would be an AH for doing so.

807,AITA for telling my half sister she shouldn't move to the U.S. to live with our dad?,24,Asshole,34,hrs0wo,1594863352.0,"Background: My half sister and I share the same dad but have different moms. My half sister is about a decade older than me, and the product of a one year marriage my dad had when he was stationed in Germany. She is German by citizenship. 

My dad came back stateside and had me with my mom. I'm a U.S. citizen. I am married and have 2 kids of my own, and live in my own home two states away. 

My half sister is basically a gypsy. She has no education, no career, no ambition, and spends most of her time hanging out in Berlin pubs and getting drunk or doing drugs. She is a full blown communist by her own admission and is frank about her contempt for the U.S. and ""Americunts."" She works part time in public elementary schools doing clerical work, and makes up the rest with state welfare benefits she gets from the German government.

About 6 years ago she got knocked up by a drug addict. Addict-boy disappeared the night she delivered his kid, and hadn't been heard from since [presumed dead]. My half sister is literally the last person on Earth who should be a mother, because she is one of the laziest and most irresponsible people I have ever met. My sister is a vegan, so she forces her child to be a vegan and in is so painfully obvious the child is malnourished. Little kids should not have bags under their eyes and they should not be losing their hair!

So fast forward to today. My sister realizes that she is incapable of being a responsible mother. My half sister is getting ready to fly to the United States. I have no idea how she thinks she is going to get in because the borders are closed, but they still bought a November plane ticket. Regardless, her plan is to move in with our dad so he and my mom can help her raise her kid. Knowing my sister, she is going to take advantage of my parents. I honestly cannot ever imagine her getting a driver's license, a job, or even lifting a finger to help raise her own kid once she realizes that my parents are going to do everything for her.

I am terrified of how poorly we are handling coronavirus in the US and how our kids might have to go back to school in September. Sister doesn't care about dangerous schools, though. Despite all of the problems that her child will face, my sister is ready to throw her child to the wolves just so she can sleep in and go to bars to find fresh dick. 

Ihave been vocally against her moving here for months now, and everyone in my family thinks I am an asshole because I am saying I don't think my own sister should get a free ride.

My parents are retired and they have worked their entire lives to get where they are. 

I don't think it's fair for my hard working parents to have to pay for their granddaughters health insurance and college. 

Am I an asshole for telling my family that my sister should not move to America and that she is going to be a freeloading leech?

EDIT: I should add, I don't think it's fair for my parents to shoulder all the costs of their grandchild when their own fucking daughter is 100% capable of working but refuses because work ""is for bourgeoisie trash.""

We were raised by our grandparents. Grandfather died when I was 12. I don't even remember my parents. 

Things were fine until my sister came out as a bisexual few years ago. We have had a lot of encounter with LQBTQ people in my lifetime and I have never seen Grandma act anything less than supportive. I guess it's the typical ""I don't mind gay people as long as they aren't in my family"" kind of homophobic. Things went downhill fast between them. 

My sister had a serious gf and my grandma kept trying to get my sister to date a guy because ""it's not like you don't have a choice like a lesbian. You can choose a guy, can't you?""  

Me and my sister tried to get her to understand, but she just wasn't understanding. A year ago, my grandma's health started deteriorating. She passed away a few months ago. She saved up a lot of money for me and my sister. From what she worked, grandpa's life insurance, she sold the farm as she couldn't take care of it when she got old. 

Few days after she died, me and my sister found out that grandma left me like 90 percent and her 10 percent. I told her that I will give her equal share despite what the will said. 

At the funeral, my sister made a big stink. She got drunk and she got up on the stage and gave a long speech about how awful my grandmother was for not accepting her and how selfish she was etc etc. She even said that she was such a bad person and that no one should cry for the loss of such a horrible person. 

I was so hurt that I couldn't even give the eulogy I had prepared. Was she homophobic? Yes. Was it wrong? Yes. But she also raised us both lovingly until 2 years ago. I am not saying she was right or defending her. Her homophobia was disgusting and me/my sister would get into lot of fights with her over it. 

But she raised us. Minus the last few years, she has been loving, kind and supportive. Instead of celebrating her life, my sister decided to tarnish my grandma's funeral. Even though there was a part of her I didn't like, it doesn't mean everything was unlikable about her. 

I refused to talk to my sister after that. Few weeks ago, she called me asking me about the inheritance (Edit: she got 10 percent. She was calling about the remaining 40 percent). I pretty much told her that since grandma was such a bad person, she shouldn't dirty her hands with money that was earned/saved by her. My sister got pissed off and she told me that I am just trying to steal her money. And that I am liar because I promised and I am going back on word.

My sister has a 10 yr old from a previous abusive relationship, and he has said to me that he doesn‚Äôt like when just my sister‚Äôs partner is looking after them because he‚Äôs mean to them, and doesn‚Äôt let him play with his toys (which I of course told my sister about right away, and said she ‚Äòtalked‚Äô to him), but I just hate the way he speaks to my sister and my niece and nephew. He‚Äôs the type of person that even when he‚Äôs not being aggressive, he sounds aggressive and makes me feel uncomfortable. 
I recently found out from my mom that he has apparently said that he‚Äôs just staying with my sister until he can save up enough money, even though my sister is in over $10,000 worth of debt supporting them all by herself. 

My partner also greatly dislikes him, and neither of us want him attending, especially where it‚Äôs such a small event.

810,AITA for getting mad when my boyfriend said he hated my personality?,21,Not the A-hole,27,hquzvz,1594730207.0,"(On mobile)

My (19F) boyfriend (21M) of 3 years and I just moved in together. We‚Äôve also been in isolation for the past week because we recently travelled to visit family. 

Overall I‚Äôm a very sensitive person, so I may be overreacting to this situation. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for a few years. I‚Äôve tried antidepressants (and only got terrible side effects) and have been in therapy for almost 4 years. When I was 16, bf broke up with me because he felt overwhelmed by my sadness. I was more or less okay with his reasoning (you shouldn‚Äôt feel forced to stay with someone who brings you down), but even after he told me he had made a mistake and we got back together I was still scared that I would never be happy enough for someone to commit to me. 

Today I had a bad day. I didn‚Äôt feel like doing anything, I mostly laid on the couch and slept. He made dinner and was generally kind throughout the day, maybe a bit snappy but I figured it was the quarantine blues. After dinner I told him I would wash the dishes in a bit, but I wanted to relax for a while first because I had a stomach ache. 

All of a sudden he starts getting upset. Telling me that when he has a bad day he just acknowledges it and goes on with his day. I told him, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be that guy, but I‚Äôm depressed‚Äù. I was trying to point out that he is in a different situation than me. He says that that‚Äôs part of the problem and that he‚Äôs been having bad thoughts about our relationship lately. I said ‚ÄúOkay, so what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù He tells me that being around someone who‚Äôs sad ‚Äúfor no reason‚Äù all the time is exhausting and that I don‚Äôt act like myself when I‚Äôm down. He also said he hates my personality when I‚Äôm not around him. When I questioned him further about the second part, he said ‚Äúthe way I talked to my friends on zoom last night was stupid‚Äù and ‚ÄúI spend too much time playing video games‚Äù.

I tried to tell him how ridiculous what he said is, and that I was very hurt that he said he ‚Äúhated‚Äù my personality and I started raising my voice. He told me I‚Äôm overreacting and he yelled ‚Äúhow the FUCK are we supposed to talk about our relationship if you overreact at everything I say?‚Äù I told him saying he hated my personality was not helping me feel better and would not improve my mood. He went on to say that he was just saying the first thing that came to mind, trying to get it off his chest and I had to realize that he wasn‚Äôt going to ‚Äúcensor himself‚Äù to try to make me feel better.

Eventually he told me I was being too sensitive and that I needed to not take what he says so seriously. He said that I always told him to tell me if something was wrong in our relationship so he was telling me exactly what he was thinking. I mumbled an apology and went to work (online).

He has a tendency to exaggerate (saying he hates something when he just dislikes aspects of it) which I knew. But I also have super low self esteem which he knows. I think I am in the right here. But I might be wrong. AITA?",False,False,2020-07-14 05:36:47

My spouce got irritated yesterday because I saw a picture of my grandmother on Facebook and
I just got really bummed because I wanna see my nana really bad. She's sick and old and I just wanna see her more before she passes. So I mentioned it to my spouce and they got pissed off and was like "" Why did you even more here if you keep talking about wanting to go back""....I don't wanna go back I wanna visit. Then she goes on to say she's sick of hearing about me wanting to go to go visit because I've already been there and seen all there is to see and we never go anywhere....like...I just wanna see my family more. Then she basically goes on to say it's not happening and poor people don't get to visit their families and blah blah blah

We have been together 7 or 8 years and she wants to take trips but out of our relationship things have been hard monetarily. We took care of her great grandmother with dementia for a few years till she died (no trips, it was 24 hr care), had a couple of super rocky roommate situations, then we were homeless for 2 years. Also the whole time we were homeless I was a full time student.
I provide the only income and have for a few years. My spouce can't work. We were living off just me being on disability but now I JUST got a fantastic job with like benefits and vacation time. So we can go do more of what she wants to do.... 
But I just WISH I could see my family more.
My parents footed the bill for us to go visit in 2018, and it was a shit show. They were abusive when I was a kid. But my parents and I have been working on our relationships over the years.

It's been pretty frustrating but I've not said anything about it until recently since I've been furloughed and not been working so I just put up with it. In the last few weeks, I've had to go back to work and needed to get up early so it really isn't something I can just go with anymore.

I decided the least confrontational, and best socially distanced way of dealing, with it would be to get the kid some headphones. I was worried that it might come across a little passive aggressive so I ordered a pair (of pretty nice) headphones and a code for for Fortnite vbucks for ps4, which I had delivered to their address with a friendly gift note letting them know who I was and thanking them in advance. 

Well, my neighbour came around after it got delivered and was really angry and upset. He said I had no right to send gifts and creepy messages to his child. With him being at my door and my concern about covid meant I didn't really respond in the best way. I told him to get away from my doorstep and that I had a right to be able to sleep at a reasonable hour in my own home.

813,AITA for wanting to go to the eye doctor to get glasses?,21,Not the A-hole,65,hpqm1z,1594568811.0,"So scrolling through facebook the other day I had come across a picture that was essentially ""this is what a person with astigmatism sees, and this is what a normal person sees."" And the astigmatism picture was showing lense flares coming off car lights, and the normal picture was just normal balls of lights. I was honestly shocked because I always saw the astigmatism side, and thought it was normal. (Something that a coworker of mine who also saw the picture said she had the same reaction)

After seeing that post, i started looking into astigmatism to see exactly what it is, and (if you dont know) its a malformation of the curvature of your eyes that affects the way light shines into them. And some symptoms are eye strain, headaches, light sensitivity, etc. And when I saw the symptoms I was fairly certain that I do have this. This isnt something that you self diagnose tho, and it did say that it can be corrected with glasses. 

I had just gotten insurance from my job, which includes vision, and I expressed to my mom about how I want to go to the doctor to see if I do have this, and see about getting glasses for it because my light sensitivity is real and i hate it so much. So if theres a chance getting glasses will help it, i want to try. My mom pretty much dismissed me because i do have 20/20 vision, i can see just fine, it's just the lights that bother me. She basically told me that if i havent had a problem with it before, i shouldnt let a facebook post convince me I need glasses (I'm 24f). If I do go to the eye doctor I would need her to drive me since I know I cant drive after they dilate my pupils, or at least it's not safe for me to.

814,AITA for not returning the neighbor's cat?,24,No A-holes here,15,hpnf6u,1594552311.0,"I live very close to my family (we live on opposite sides of the yard) and we are all currently petless. My sister used to have a dog which passed away several years ago (at 16 - he lived a long and happy life adore by us all) and my one sister uses to have a cat but took her with her when she moved out. My other sister has wanted another dog but lives with my parents and they do not want another dog in the house. We have talked about getting a cat but my parents don't want a cat either.

One day this spring a cat literally strolled out of the woods, greeted us, and made itself at home. We assumed it was a stray but after a few inquiries we found out it was the neighbor's cat (who lives about half a mile away). They said the cat often wanders off and is gone for a few days at a time. We assumed they would come get it. They did not. We had some cans of cat food left over from a stray we'd sheltered awhile back so we fed the cat, and then one thing led to another and we bought cat food, treats, toys, beds, etc. We are all in love with kitty. She comes to greet me when I come home from work, spends hours snuggled in our laps, we know just how she likes her ear scratched, etc. She has never been away from the house since she arrived. She sleeps on the porch and on the windowsill aND acts like she owns the place. :)

My mom messaged the neighbor a few weeks later and reminded them that the cat was still here and said that we were all enjoying loving on her. Neighnor wrote back and said ""Haha, yeah she's not very friendly."" We were taken aback because this cat would literally snuggle 24/7 if we let it so we even sent a pic to xonfirm it was in fact their cat we had (it was).

Here's the thing: it's been months. The neighbors drive past our house multiple times a day. I'm of the opinion that we now have a cat. The only reason they had kitty was because the mom work at the animal shelter and couldn't bear to see it put down when it didn't get adopted. They have multiple other rescues the same way and I think they're probably happy to see kitty in a loving home where they don't have to worry about it (plus their comment about her not being very loving makes me think being in a household wit so many dogs was stressing her out). Plus she's not exactly running home or wandering anymore.

I want to ask the neighbors to let me know when her last shots were and offer to take her to the vet when due. My mom thinks we should just stay status quo or take her back. She asks what will happen if my sister moves out, but 1) my sister is not considering moving out anytime soon, aND 2) if she did she or I could take the cat as we're both very attached. My mom admits that while she did not want a cat, she enjoys having this one.

815,AITA for going back to the night shift against my wife's wishes?,25,Asshole,31,hpmeip,1594547979.0,"I (34m) have been working overnights at my job for most of the time that I've been married to my wife (33f.)  We have 5 and 4 year-old girls and a 2-year-old boy. My wife's always disliked me being on night shift but at my work shifts are awarded based on seniority  and I didn't have the seniority to be on day shift until about 7 months ago.

Truth be told I wasn't really that excited to go to day shift, but since my wife really wanted me to I agreed to give it a try at least. So I did, but I didn't really like it. I'm a night owl by nature for one thing and hate waking up to an early alarm. Night shift is more laid-back where I work, at least most of the time, and it's the shift most of my coworkers who I consider  my friends work. Bottom line I was just happier on overnights. I also get a shift premium being on nights. It's only 55 cents more an hour but we have three kids and every bit helps.

Recently a spot opened back up on nights. I talked to my wife and told her I was going to take it. She wasn't happy about it and said that if I took it I'd be putting my wants ahead of my family's. I don't really see how as it doesn't change the logistics of much with her and the kids. I'm pretty much just swapping the time I'd be sleeping with the time I'm working. The only real disadvantage is that I'm not home to help get the kids to bed on nights that I work, but working 12 hour shifts means that I have a lot of days off. Working nights I'm able to help them up and fed before I go to bed and will be able to get them off to school when that starts. I thinks it's really a wash as far as my family goes.

When I pressed her my wife said that her main objection is that she just doesn't like to be alone at night. She also thinks that being on nights screws up my schedule even on my days off. I feel bad about leaving her alone at night knowing she doesn't like it but I'm just way happier on night shift, so I made the unilateral choice to take the opening, but my wife is NOT happy with me. AITA?

For the past few months I've noticed that he plays video games with friends for 4+ hours whenever I am over. For an hour or two it is fine, as I can be on my phone or play my own games on my laptop, but longer than that it gets irritating because I have to hear his ""gamer rage"" as I'm 4 feet away from him (and it is also frustrating when I am trying to sleep), and that I drove 20 minutes for him to act like I am not present.

I've voiced my concerns a lot lately, as it makes me feel like he likes playing games with his friends more than being with me, as I take the time out of my day to come over, I want him to spend his time with me! He's more than welcome to play games when I am NOT over. 

He's expressed that I'm being ridiculous. His two favorite things in life are video games, and me. And he's not giving up either of them, and I shouldn't tell him to not do something that he enjoys.

My (26m) brother was ecstatic that. I bought a switch.

I didn‚Äôt mind that he wanted to come over and watch, however it annoyed me how he would always watch over my shoulder and how every time I pulled out my switch he had to watch.

And today my dad was doing the usual commenting on how much I was eating and I tried to tell him that I was irritated but he wouldnt stop so I kind of started to cry and yell at him so he started to scrwma about me about how I was an ungrateful bitch and sent me to my room.

When my mom came home he played the victim card and now I am grounded. So I am wondering reddit am I the ass hole?


Edit: I don't mind what my dad says but I wanted to know if I handled the situation correctly I wouldn't lose weight because I've worked are for the figure I have: I have 90 cm shoulders 65cm waist and 93 hips also my doctor sad I will not be getting taller.",False,1594770920.0,2020-07-14 18:23:04
828,AITA for not wanting my mother to lie in my bed?,22,Not the A-hole,21,hqubup,1594727352.0,"Growing up, I (19F) had very little privacy from my parents. They would regularly go through my iPod/phone, read my messages, etc.
My one safe place in the house that could-or I wanted to- be untouched by anyone else was my bed. Something that no one but me was allowed to get in.
Now, when I was a child this wasn‚Äôt the case. My mother really enjoyed lying in my bed to hang out and chat. Because I was a child I couldn‚Äôt stop her- she‚Äôs the parent- but I made every effort anyway. We‚Äôre talking begging, crying, refusing to talk to her, etc.- I REALLY wanted my one safe place.
Now that I‚Äôm an adult (still living at home- I can‚Äôt afford to move out) I do have marginally more privacy as they don‚Äôt go through my phone or read messages or anything like that anymore (well, my mum does check into my social media sometimes), but I‚Äôd still like to have that one untouched place. My mum will reluctantly agree to not get in my bed but not without extensive argument. She complains that I‚Äôm being unfair because ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do anything, I won‚Äôt talk, I‚Äôll just lie here quietly!‚Äù, when I‚Äôve said that I will happily spend time with her elsewhere- just not in my bed. She complains that I‚Äôm being difficult and selfish and that in life I need to ‚Äúput yourself out for other people sometimes‚Äù. What I don‚Äôt understand is why this needs to happen in my bed rather than somewhere else in the house. 
She doesn‚Äôt accept any reasoning either; she complains that she doesn‚Äôt understand why I won‚Äôt let her into my bed, and can‚Äôt just accept that I don‚Äôt like it. 
Since we are both home all the time due to quarantine, we have this argument at least once a week, and she brings up the fact that I don‚Äôt let her in my bed (made worse by the fact that my sister (16) DOES let her in her bed) during unrelated conversations quite often too.
I know that this is my parents‚Äô house and I haven‚Äôt paid for the house in any capacity, and don‚Äôt provide anything else for the family like food or anything, so I have to live by my parents rules, but I feel like surely I should be allowed to have one untouched thing for myself.

829,WIBTA if my mom lost her job because of me?,22,Asshole,35,hq9e9p,1594646202.0,"My fianc√© and I have been living with my parents for the past few years, to save money for a down payment on a house and his work is nearby. He does pay rent, $250 a month and helps pay groceries here and there, errands, etc. I do not pay rent(per their request), however, I do pay the yearly sewage bill.

My fianc√© likes to pay in a lump sum(example, he will pay rent for 6 months up front) So rent for the 6 months is coming up. However, my parents said they raised the rent to $450 a month and that they told me before (I don't recall this) to tell him this. No explanation to why they raised the rent. I did not agree to this sudden jump in rent, and told my fianc√© the new rent amount.

He said he'd pay it, but I suggested to him to move out soon and live with his grandfather's basement rent free to save money. The reason why he didn't do this to start was because my fiance works overnight in a hospital cleaning patient room(including Covid-19 rooms) and since his grandfather is at risk of getting sick easily, he didn't want to take a chance of getting his grandfather sick. His parents live an hour away, so that was out of the question as well.

If my fianc√© moves out to his grandfathers, he would take care of him from when the morning caretaker leaves(5pm), until he goes to work at 11pm. Here is where lies the 'dilemma'.

My mother is his grandfather's caretaker at night, from 5pm to 10pm and gets paid well. This is her second job, and is more of an extra cash, and she does love him like he was her own father. If he moves out, they wouldn't need her anymore since he'd be doing her job. I told my fiance this and he felt bad he could be costing her a job, but I told him it's not his fault since they raised the rent so suddenly without even talking to him. He felt hurt that they didn't talk to him directly.

He said he will think about it, but I will be telling my mom what is going to happen if the rent is getting increased. He said he didn't mind an increase had they talked to him directly versus me. He is a pretty friendly guy, and understanding about situations changing, and has a great relationship with my parents, so it's not like they couldn't talk to him.

I said for now, to pay the new monthly rent, and I'll split it with him, but to no longer offer to pay for groceries or errands if they can't be direct with him. He doesn't like that idea either, and said it seems spiteful. I know $450 a month isn't much, compared to actually renting an apartment or paying a monthly mortage, but it's the way they went about it is what makes me feel mad and spiteful.

If he does go through with it, she will lose her night job as his grandfather's caretaker(I think she makes roughly 1500 a month, 25 hours a week) and it would be because of my idea to him. She has her main job, but currently due to Covid-19, is furloughed until the beginning of August. I just want to give her a heads up as it could likely happen.",False,False,2020-07-13 06:16:42

The problem being that most of my friends were homophobic, very openly and proudly which always disgusted me, my bestfriend (M18) being one of them. I thought that since we were still young and still lived on our tiny, mostly conservative, island I could give him the benefit of the doubt, I thought maybe when we go away for college ( we have to go to a different country for college ) it‚Äôll open his mind more. I quickly came to realize that that wasn‚Äôt going to happen so I had an honest conversation with him, I asked him if he would ever even try to open his mind and he told me he could never, I tried to make him see how he was hurting me and he was being ignorant about the whole situation, he told me I was overreacting.

Me and GF have been dating for about 2 years now. I currently work ~13 hours a day 6 days a week. She is unemployed due to COVID. We live in an apartment together in which I pay all of the rent for. We do not have any children together, only a dog. Things have been going smoothly, when this all started, she would have dinner ready, laundry washed, place clean, dog walked, every night when I got home. She has recently stopped doing most of those things. I come home to a messy place, no clean work uniforms, no dinner ready. She says she is not a homemaker, and it is not her job to do those things. I told her spending a couple hours a day doing some basic chores is more than a fair trade for me supporting us. I honestly don‚Äôt even have time to do chores when I get home, I have a couple hours max of free time when I get home, then I go to sleep.

836,WIBTA If I disowned my family for not helping with my fathers final expenses?,21,Not the A-hole,14,hotp70,1594432709.0,"TLDR at bottom, sorry in advance for typos and mobile formatting.

My (21f) father (56) passed away last Monday after a 6 month fight with terminal cancer. My sister and I were his primary caretakers, her and I did this alone. We are so proud to have done this for him but it was also very traumatic to watch him deteriorate and leave when he so badly wanted to stay. 

We are now planning his funeral and death is expensive. My dad did not have a ton of assets and was adamant on making sure me, my sister, and her child can be taken care of by him in any way after he‚Äôs gone. He wanted a small graveside ceremony with immediate family. 

Now comes the shit show. My grandmother is VERY wealthy to say the least. My grandfather passed away some years ago so my grandmother owns everything. Basically, she is has more money than I can conceptualize. I have in no way ever felt entitled to this money and live in my own apartment, I pay my own bills, and I work full time. My dad never felt and entitlement to this either and built his legacy on the salary he earned. He was so brilliant and an amazing, and taught me to be independent in the same way. 

My uncle passed away suddenly just 3 weeks before my dad. He had zero assets and my grandma was ‚Äústuck with the responsibility of his arrangements‚Äù in her words. I can empathize with her but she is refusing to be of any help with my fathers final expenses. She is acting in anger and resentment for my dad not getting treatment with a stage 4 diagnosis and cancer in 3 places. Who would? We truly would not be able to do it without her as it would be the entirety of what he left us and he would be mortified. It‚Äôs the principle of the situation to us.. 

All of this has caused a huge fight between the family. My aunt locked me out of his office at the family company after cornering me in there. I‚Äôve always been welcomed in that office and have never needed permission to go there. She acted like I was doing something shady and it sent me into the worst panic attack of my life 6 days after watching my dad die. She is now telling me not to contact her again or go to his office. He has many special memories in there that I need. Everything is still up in the air but we had to cancel the services we planned until we know what my grandma is and isn‚Äôt willing to help with. 

My question is, WIBTA if I disown and never talk to my family again for disrupting my fathers rest and our mourning process because of money and entitlement? I‚Äôve seen an evil side of my family I never have before and feel this is unforgivable. 

I‚Äôm sorry I know this is all over the place, it‚Äôs so complex and condensing the story makes this situation more confusing than it already is, I‚Äôm willing to answer questions in the comments. Thanks for reading

My (41 F) husband Jorge (44 M) recently got a substantial sum of money willed to him by his mother‚Äôs (Maggie) partner of 30 years, Bob.¬†Bob was a total curmudgeon, but he and Jorge (my husband) got along really well, since Jorge is pretty easygoing.

Jorge‚Äôs older sister, Natalia, hated Bob with a fiery passion, not only for being hard to be around (he could be opinionated and rude, with absolutely no concept of compromise), but because she suspected Bob was verbally abusive to Maggie. However, whenever Jorge talked to his mother about Bob, Maggie always insisted that she was happy being with him. So we took her at her word. Natalia, however, was unconvinced. She believed that her and Jorge‚Äôs mother (Maggie) had made a bad decision in partners, and would often confront Bob about his behavior, hoping that Maggie would leave him. 

Jorge, on the other hand, tolerated Bob because even though Bob was a jerk to most people, Maggie loved him.¬†Over the years, a rift formed between Natalia‚Äôs own family (she has a husband and two kids), and Maggie and Bob. But Jorge and I would frequently fly out to his mom and Bob for visits, and we felt like they always enjoyed our company. We had differing opinions on things, but Bob was generally very pleasant to us.

Recently, Bob died and left his property and most of his money to Maggie. Each of the younger generation of folks in his family, like Natalia‚Äôs children, also got a fair amount. And he unexpectedly left a large sum to Jorge:¬†a settlement that Bob received after an accident that named both Maggie (my MIL) and Jorge (my husband) as beneficiaries. Natalia (my sister-in-law) was left nothing.

Now Natalia is upset that Bob left money to Jorge. If no money had been left for my husband, she claims there wouldn't be an issue, but because they are both Maggie's children, she thinks they should receive equal amounts. She claims that Bob is, even now, tearing a rift in the family by not including her, and feels she‚Äôs the only one who ever stood up to Bob, so it‚Äôs unfair that she should be punished for ‚Äúdoing what was right.‚Äù She sees the fact that she was not named an equal beneficiary in the settlement money as a big old ""Screw You,"" even though her kids were named in the will. She would like us to pool the settlement money and split it with her three ways.

Three things:¬†

1. Bob did not want Natalia to have any of his money.¬†He didn‚Äôt like her.
2. This money issue is a big source of drama in the family, and is causing my mother-in-law (Maggie) a lot of anxiety. She would like Jorge to keep the money, but is open to splitting it for the sake of keeping the peace. 
3. No one in this scenario is in great need of the money, but Natalia‚Äôs family is quite well-off.

839,AITA for refusing to feed the cats this morning,21,Asshole,61,ho1stn,1594324621.0,"A little background: my bf and I have been dating for about 3 years now and living together for the last 5 months. He's been working full time and doing school up until about two weeks ago, so I've taken on most household responsibilities (i.e. cooking, cleaning, shopping, etc.) until he wasn't so busy. Also, I have recently been diagnosed with a disease that makes me not have a lot of energy right now. I am getting treatment, but it's still at about another week before I finish that and hopefully feel more normal.

Now, onto the story. We currently have three cats in the apartment. My cat, his cat, and my sister's kitten (our former foster), who is staying with us until my sister moves into her new apartment next week. Right now, the cats are on a feeding schedule because the vet said his cat needs to lose some weight. I usually feed them right before I leave for work in the morning (around 7:15) since he doesn't wake up until about 10:00 or 11:00 (he works an mid-day shift). I also wake up at 7:15 on weekends to feed the cats while my bf sleeps in. This morning I woke up around 6:30 and decided that, rather than be productive, I was going to laze around in bed until the very last minute. I was messing around on my phone a bit and, around 6:45 the kitten starts jumping up on the bed and meowing in my face, wanting fed. Normally I would get up and feed her but this morning she also started biting me which is behavior I do not want to reinforce, so I stayed in bed. My boyfriend woke up (the kitten has a VERY loud meow) and told me the cat wanted to be fed. I told him I would feed them before I left, but I didn't want the kitten to think biting was an appropriate way to wake someone up. He continued to urge me to go feed them until I got mad and snapped, saying that if he wanted her to be quiet, he could feed them himself. He got up and did that, but when he came back to bed, he was clearly upset with me. AITA for refusing to feed the cats this morning and making my bf do it?

&#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people seem to think I was refusing to feed the cats at all. I was simply waiting to feed them for 15-25 minutes until I got up for the day. The plan was to feed them at their normal time.

EDIT 2: The kitten is not starving. I give her multiple small meals (along with the other cats' regular feeding) throughout the day since I know she is growing and needs to eat more. She was biting me because she was impatient for the wet food I give the cats in the morning. She loves that stuff and is always eager to eat it.

EDIT 3: I realize there are better ways I could have dealt with the situation. I talked it through more thoroughly with some of my coworkers and realized there are some other things that I'm also upset about which probably affected my behavior during this situation. I'd like to thank everyone who did not accuse of of neglecting/abusing my cats for their advice and opinions on the situation.",False,1594299973.0,2020-07-09 12:57:01

So my friends and I all enjoy playing D&D, and have a good time of it. I'm usually the one who DM's, but for our most recent campaign, another player(We'll call them X) asked if they could DM as they had an idea they were very excited for, so we all agreed.

Even before the campaign began we had issues, such as X pretty much forcing another player, J, to play a specific race and even picking out her warlock patron for her. J knew next to nothing about her character after that and really didn't have fun playing him.

But the issue that everyone in our group agrees in a big AH move is her asking me long before the game started if I'd play a character who would die for the plot before I played the character I was actually planning on playing. I agreed, because the idea sounded fun, and from the way she described it, my first character would be dead by the time we reached level 2 or 3. I ended up playing him up until level 5, and the first I got to play him was the last time we could meet up in person before quarantine.

During quarantine we've all kept in contact, and even asked multiple times when we could play next. X has brushed us off multiple times, saying that DMing over Discord is too difficult.

A month in, X made a whole new PC that they won't stop talking about and even forcing another player to make a romantic interest for this PC. One of the others in our group eventually dis a mini-oneshot over Discord since we missed playing and who should give them pointers on how to DM over discord better but X?

Cut to just a few weeks ago with X still brushing us off and during the first time the group could meet up (Minus X), we all learn that not only did X tweet about not wanting to DM anymore because they want to play, but that same day a friend of theirs told them they knew a group that needed a DM, so X offered. One of our players very heavily suspects that the reason X was so eager to DM for them is because that friend is a semi-popular twitch streamer.

After knowing this info, I texted X again if we were ever going back to our previous campaign. They asked very eagerly if I was asking because I wanted to DM again and was worried I would upset them by going to DM a new campaign, but became very dodgy again once I told them no, I‚Äôm asking because I want to play.

So I (19F) play Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic, and collect notable misprints and rare cards. Magic The Gathering just released a set, Ikoria, wherein they included Godzilla cards. The cards are full art, look very nice for collecting, etc. One of them is unfortunately named Spacegodzilla, Death Co*ona (censored because I dunno if a bot will flag it). Wizards of the Coast in a statement confirmed that the name will be changed in online simulators and future prints, they had just designed and planned it and couldn't change anything before releasing it.

 So I was interested in grabbing at least a copy for my personal collection, and possibly more to sell later on. I finally got a copy and told my friend (20M) about my plans to hold on to a few to sell in the future. He told me that what I was doing was pretty gross, trying to profit off a global situation where people were literally dying. I told him that whether I bought these or not, they still existed and I would like to have them and that it's no different from say, Uber Eats trying to advertise and increase their revenue from the current situation.

Me (25yof) and my wife (28yof) have been married for 2.5 years now, dating for 6 years. I have come out as a lesbian to my parents multiple times. When I first came out I was a freshman in college and visiting home for the weekend. I only told my dad, I asked him to not tell mom, that I was going to come out to her when I was ready. My dad didn‚Äôt seem surprised and told me he suspected I was gay for a long time, asked if I dated certain friends in high school and then didn‚Äôt talk about it for the rest of the day. I went back to college and received a text from my dad, telling me to stay at college for all holidays that I was no longer welcome home. 

I didn‚Äôt speak to my parents until the spring, they reached out to me and didn‚Äôt mention anything about me being gay. They came to my sporting events and acted completely normal. I visited them over the summer. My mom wanted to drive home, when we got on the interstate my mom locked the doors and asked if I told my dad something but never told her. I told her I was gay, and I was scared to tell her because I loved her very much and didn‚Äôt want to lose her. She became angry and told me how I was disgusting and disgraceful to the family. 

I graduated college and moved out of state. At one point my parents offered to start a business with me, I asked them what would happen when I wanted to get married to a woman. My parents interrogated me for almost three hours. They said they didn‚Äôt realize I was still gay, that I was lying to them, demanded to know how many partners I‚Äôve slept with. they said it was my fault I was gay, I should have told them I was confused as a kid so they could get me proper help like Allie (not real name) had (Allie was my first love who was shipped off to conservation therapy after her parents found love letters). 

I was (stupidly) optimistic that my parents would come to the wedding. My mom and I had several conversations, but they always ended in her crying and telling me she could not accept me and I shouldn‚Äôt even want her there since she does not support the marriage. They did not come, and shamed and guilted any family member that said they would attend. 

I distanced myself from them for the first year I was married. We rarely spoke, but eventually we began talking regularly again. 

Recently on the phone, My mom became very serious and started going off about how I should find myself a nice Christian man, that she does not support my marriage, and she wished I lived a Christian lifestyle. I was so shocked by this because my parents have not made a single comment about my partner or our marriage since we reconnected.

He hasn't tooken them away, but it hurts me to hear that.I never had a problem with the language, it's mainly because of my relationship with my dad.

One day, he dragged me into our living room and forced me to learn Spanish. He starting pressuring me to write words I knew in Spanish(which wasn't a lot with pressure). He started to yell at me how I was a disappointment to my family since I didn't speak Spanish. I started to cry uncontrollable and he yelled at me even more.

847,AITA for prioritizing my education over a marriage?,19,Not the A-hole,13,hpruqz,1594575963.0,"So I am trying to wrap my head around this because I am getting mixed responses from my friends. My gf (28) and I (26) have been together for almost 2 years and we started to talk about marriage. I love her with all my heart and I do want to get married eventually. We live together but finances are seperated.

Now here is the problem. We both are enrolled in M.A. programs in our respective fields and we are paying a considerable amount of money compared to income. Granted the debts will be done in a few months, but it especially shook me financially. Now, if all goes planned, I can start PhD. next summer but I will have to pay almost 8 times my current salary in 2 years (we are in middle east so leaving out the currency) to the program. Furthermore, military service is obligatory and if I don't want to lose my job, I need to pay 6 times my salary to avoid military service. 

The thing is, she wants to get married next summer and I feel like I don't have the financial stability to afford a wedding and all the other expenses. It is also not possible to just have a small ceremony because a big wedding is a tradition and her family won't accept a small ceremony.

I told her all of this and she said she will not wait another year to get married and that I am an asshole for prioritizing education over wedding expenses.

848,AITA for putting the dog out of my room?,22,Asshole,19,hpa8ji,1594504002.0,"This just happened a few hours ago but I still do not know if I was an AH or not.

Context: My family just got a new puppy, been with us for almost 2 weeks but I rarely sleep with him. He is almost fully housetrained in the bathroom department, but he still has some accidents every few days. He usually sleeps with my cousin in her room, but last night I asked if he could sleep in my room. She accepted, which made it the second time he has slept in my room. I (15m) usually get up around 10 am or so, which is normal and encouraged with the kids right now.

Here is where I may be the AH: I was having a nice time sleeping when the new dog woke me up at about 6 am, so I was very tired. I dealt with his noise for a little bit while trying to go back to sleep, but eventually, I got tired of hearing him squirm around on his bed gnawing on a bone, so I took him, his bed, and his bone outside my room and closed the door on him so I could get some more sleep. Note I was super tired and only looking for more sleep at that point, so I forgot to take him outside as it never occurred to me he needed to be taken out.

Anyways, about 10 min later, just as I was drifting off, my guardian burst into my room and asked me if I had taken the dog out. I thought she meant outside the house, so I responded ""No?"" because I had no idea what was going on. Again, still tired, I didn't realize that he had probably peed. A few seconds later I heard her talking about his mess, and that was when I realized he probably went to the bathroom.

Still trying to grasp the impossible sleep at this point, I tried to go back to sleep, but then my guardian came back in and asked me if I had lied, and I said ""No, I did not lie."" Then she clarified if I had put him outside my room, and I said I did, so she told me to clean up his mess, and I did with no hesitation.

TLDR: Put the dog outside my room so I could get some sleep, forgot to take him outside so he could pee, then he peed in the house, angering my guardian.

Here's some context (and I(M17) apologize in advance if this sounds like couples therapy).

Context: For the past week (Mon-Fri) my girlfriend(F17) has made plans with a different friend every day to come over to her house, with the exception of Thursday. Before this, for the entirety of our five-ish month relationship, we would FaceTime a lot, because we live 25 minutes away by drive. However, for the entire week, she called me about three times, each less than five minutes to say hello and go back to her friend. No texts and no calls.

Then once her friend would leave she'd tell me she is gonna spend time with her family and that she wouldn't call me until she's going to bed (which is usually around 11-11:30). And this happened for the entire week. 

Last night, on Friday, she had a friend over. Then did her thing and told me at 10:05 pm she'd call me soon. I was in a Discord call with a few friends prior to that and we were playing Minecraft about hour before that. I was ready to leave and talk to her at that time. However, there was no call. Not for another hour. 

When she calls, since it's been over an hour, I got into that ""zone"" and got hyperfocused on the game. I then let her know I'm a bit busy and need 20 more minutes but I have no problem staying on the call while I finish up. I said this while focused on the game instead of giving her 100% attention. She insisted I hung up and finished my game.

Exactly twenty minutes later I call her. No answer. So I call again, and no answer. I do this one more time and send a text seeing if she's still up. No answer for 30 minutes. I can tell she's upset and she explains it's because, according to her, since we didn't talk all day, she thought I'd be ready to watch our show but I wasn't and ""hung up on her"" despite my repeatedly saying I could stay on the call.

Now, I feel like I've done nothing wrong. She has spent the entire week with her friends, barely talking to me and calling me at random times expecting me to be ready at any given moment to stop what I'm doing and call her. She then tells me if the roles were flipped she would wait are her phone for an hour and wait for me to call because ""she doesn't have friends to talk to,"" despite the fact she was with a different friend every day of the week (six feet apart as far as i know).

She was the one who asked for it and Mark and his parents, Sara's former in-laws, treated her very badly after that, for quite some time. 

Last week, someone tried to break into my husband's office. They failed (the police said it was an amateur job), but they damaged his door lock a lot, so we had to change it. And since we'll be going through the trouble of installing a new lock, we decided to also install a new, safer door and an alarm system, which brought the cost way up.

My husband and I called a few locksmiths to ask for prices and one of them was Mark's father (he's a locksmith). After my husband told him he knew Mark, the father offered us a discount, which meant that his price was by far the best one we received. We ended up choosing him.

I didn't want to lie to Sara or hide things from her, so I told her. I just wanted her to be aware of what happened in the event that Mark or his father ever said anything to her about it.

She didn't take it well and said that I never should have done this because I knew how badly they treated her during and after the divorce. 

I told her I'm sorry he felt that way, but that it was unfair of her to hold this against me, because it was just a business transaction. It's not like I socialized with her ex FIL.

I'm a 36yo Male and my brother is 37yo, and when I was 4 or 5, my birth mom took us to the store for cereal and told us to wait in the car. 8 hours later, a Sheriffs officer told us our mom had dipped out the back door. 
Up until 5th grade, we both lived with our grandma, who couldn't support 2 kids on her own. So we went into foster care. Not state care, but a private organization. Most times, placements were permanent, and you wouldn't move around alot. Well, my brother went with my great aunt, and I went to live with a nice family. From 6th grade-10th grade, I had 9 placements. I moved into the Presbyterian Children's Home in 10th grade and left in my senior year. My brother never moved from our aunt's. During all this time of moving around, my caseworker was adamant about locating my birth mom, who I wanted nothing to do with. My brother though, always thought she'd come back. In 2003, my caseworker located her in AZ and wanted to send my brother and I to see her. I begrudgingly went, more to be there for my brother. I didnt want to see him get hurt again. We spent 2 weeks with her, reconnecting. I forgave her for her actions and told her that if she wanted to be part of our lives, I was okay with that. I was 19 at the time. 
When we left AZ, she promised to keep in touch (which she didn't). I got married in 2007, have an awesome Wife and 2 dope ass kids (13M & 9F). But not once during that time had either my brother or I heard anything from our mom. Well, over father's day 2020, my brother found her on Facebook. They reconnected, had several phone convos and msgs. He wanted info on his birth dad. He found out alot of great info on his dad and has been pushing me to call her. My wife and in-laws  have also been pushing me (ALOT) to call her to find info about my dad. I msgd her saying I'd call her, but never did. The more I thought about it, the more angry I got. Since we last saw her in 2003, she has 3 kids, is married and seems to be living a happy life. Which angers me that she can be a mom to those kids, while ignoring my brother and I for years. Now, everyone  are pushing me to call her, saying that i'm being TA by holding a grudge against her for her past, and that she has probably changed her ways. I'm feeling pressured to talk to her, but I dont think I have anything nice to say to her. So, AITA for blowing off my birth mom, or should I be the bigger man and reach out.

852,AITA for keeping an apartment,21,Asshole,39,hp6awr,1594483124.0,"One year ago, a colleague who needed to go abroad for one year offered her apartment to me for one year. The agreement was that she would come back to this apartment after her one year abroad. I agreed to this, since I only needed to stay in the town for one year anyway. It also benefited her because she didn't need to go through all the trouble of finding a new apartment.

A few weeks before I needed to move in, something in my professional situation changed and I thought of trying to move in to the apartment three months later than what we talked about. I ran this apartment by her, suggesting that we can split the three months -- so she can ""keep"" the apartment and I can delay my move three months in. She did not accept this and even gave me an ultimatum, even threatening that she can find somebody else if I didn't want. I tried to solve the situation by myself and give her a chance to keep the apartment. She basically forced me to take the apartment in some sense. (EDIT: To clarify, the ultimatum was I take the apartment and keep the start date, or she'd find someone else.) Because of this, I decided to stick to take it, started my contract in the apartment during the initially agreed upon start date. I did not like our conversation since she seemed to be a bit hostile.

Now that the year is almost up, and everything seems to be affected by COVID, I asked my company if I could stay in this city instead of moving to a new place as was planned before. They were fine with it, and so I've decided to stay in my apartment. With this decision, even after the unpleasant conversation we had almost a year prior, I tried to be nice with her and warn her in advance that she should find a new apartment to move in once she needed to come back. I figured this would be an optimal solution for the both of us since it minimizes the communal effort. She was going to move anyway, and it would be a net minimization of effort if she was the one to need to find a new apartment. She was mad about this, and she asked why don't I find another place and move to another place and she moves back in to her previous place (as agreed upon last year when no one could have predicted this COVID situation)... which I can understand is reasonable on her end but it just seems more convoluted than my proposed solution.

For some reason, she really wants this place and has even offered to help me move out as a ""meet halfway"" point (I don't really understand what's so halfway about this). And quite frankly, I don't really trust her enough with my things anymore, after all the conversations we had.

Anyway, I know I'm legally in the right here. I have a contract with the apartment. But she seems to think I'm the bad guy here. I've asked some friends and family the same thing, and they said I should just stay in the apartment.

I (29f) and my husband (31m) have been married for almost 5 years, and I am pregnant with twins. They will be our first children and are due at the beginning of September. Both twins are girls.

My husband and I decided very early on that I will name one twin and he will name the other. For a long time, I had known that I would name a child after my grandmother, and the middle name would be my middle name (family tradition is that the mother's middle name is the eldest daughter's middle name). Told my husband this, he was perfectly fine with it and agreed that the names were cute together.

Husband had not given future baby names any thought until that moment, and has been giving it serious thought over the last few months but was unable to find one he liked. Until last week.

Husband is an old soul and enjoys watching 80s TV shows (Dallas, Cheers, etc). Late one night, he was watching some TV show and there was a character called Valene, and Husband said it was a lightbulb moment - he wanted to name the other twin Valene, with the middle name Marie, after his grandmother, so for example the name would be Valene Marie Smith (not our surname). Husband says he is not naming the twin after the character, but because he likes the name.

I instantly told him that I like Marie, but there was absolutely no way on this Earth our child would be called Valene. For one, I just don't like the name, and for second, our child will probably be the only Valene in all of Britain and would likely be teased at school.

My husband set his heart on Valene Marie, and for the last two weeks has been trying to make me change my mind, but I won't. A couple of nights ago, he said that if I hated it so much I could name both the twins and he'll have no part in it.

I still want him to name one of the twins, but now he says he won't and I feel awful for refusing to consider his choice of name.

No. It isn't as bad as you may think! I haven't stalked or harassed.

My ex and I broke up in 2015. I moved out. Around 2 months later, she started calling me again. Mostly because her autism meant she only really felt comfortable talking to me. We did NOT enter into a relationship again, and we only had sex twice after the breakup.

In 2018, she got a new boyfriend. After calling me daily for almost 3 years, she just stopped. We never argued on the conversations, and the last call she made to me was ""I will call you tomorrow. Sleep well""

Obviously, I was worried when she didn't call, so I sent 2 messages over the next 5-days asking if she was OK. I received no response. However, my friend (who is her best friend) told me that her boyfriend had requested she stop speaking to me, and so she did.

At the tail end of 2019, I sent her a message saying ""Happy Christmas"". That was it. I knew she was alone, and I know Christmas can be an awful time of year for people. So, I simply said ""Happy Christmas"". Nothing more. Nothing less.

Last month, I was chatting with my friend (the same one as before), and she said my ex had casually mentioned getting a restraining order against me in December to her, and she said it was harassment when she made it clear she never wanted to speak to me again.

Now, for years, she had tried to break up my relationships and demand that I speak all the time to help get through her daily issues, and she dropped me the second somebody told her to. I didn't speak for a year and a half. I simply wished 'Happy Christmas'. That is it. Hell, she is on my Facebook and 'likes' my pictures. It isn't like she is interacting with me.

No. I am not leaving anything out. Hell, I haven't been in the same room as her since 2017, and I do not even discuss her with our mutual friends. There has been no harassment. Nothing.

AITA here? Did I do something wrong to deserve this? I know it is unlikely a restraining order will be granted, but this would actually be earth-shattering for me, as it would likely result in my deportation back to England. Even her just pursuing it a little bit could have negative consequences for me, granted or not.

I‚Äôm so outraged because professors never side with students or ever admit that they or a TA are wrong. I complained to my professor, but I still haven‚Äôt from him.

I (19M) have a 13 y/o sister who's a bit of a geek. She's really into Avatar, Starwars, and Percy Jackson. I don't have much of an interest in those things but it's whatever. My sister has this habit of getting into these really strong phases where she's obsessed with a certain show, movie, book, whatever for a little while until it dies down. (Her Starwars phase never rlly ended though.) Whenever she does this, she tends to ramble about whatever she's currently obsessed with and brings it up a lot which gets pretty annoying. I tell her it's kind of autistic that she gets so obsessed with these things and that it's like the only thing she thinks about for an extended period of time. I just think it's weird and I call it autistic and after awhile she stops talking about it. In reality I only mean it as a joke. I don't actually think she's autistic but it gets kinda annoying and I call her it, but I say it in a joking tone and she sometimes says it back to me in a few cases like, I'll be doing something weird and she'll be like, ""bro you're calling me this and you're out here doing this,"" so I assumed she didn't really care. Here's an example: I found out that sometimes she chills in her room wearing this starwars robe thing, (wasn't like a wookie costume, just like something jedi robes,) because apparently it ""makes her feel kinda cool"" and she ""thinks it's kinda fun."" And then she had her lightsaber and was talking about how cool it is and ""look it lights up"" and she was going on so I called her autistic. It's that kind of thing. Basically we were in an argument and long story short I told her that she was sensitive and easily bothered. She asked me how it was possible for her to be sensitive if she put up with me calling her autistic all the time. I basically told her like, ""come on, that's obviously a joke,"" and she got really mad and hasn't really been talking to me since the argument. (The argument was over me criticizing and saying bad things about her online friends a lot, she asked me to stop since it bothers her, I told her no because I have every right to express my feelings about her friends, and I thought it was kind of sensitive of her to get so bothered over it.)

I‚Äôm talking literally 2 sips of a Smirnoff Ice & acting completely belligerent like she‚Äôs taken a half dozen shots.

When sober, all M wants to talk about is Z & how great he is, & I wouldn‚Äôt think much of it except the moment she has a drink in her hand she starts talking about how Z doesn‚Äôt satisfy her in bed, she thinks she‚Äôs actually a  full-on lesbian, & only stays with Z because he has a good job, isn‚Äôt a total dick, & she doesn‚Äôt wanna break up bc she‚Äôs afraid that she wouldn‚Äôt be able to get a gf & doesn‚Äôt wanna be alone. I personally dgaf who anyone dates, it‚Äôs the constant lying & using that bothers me.

M also has a bad habit of getting extremely handsy when she drinks, which is concerning in itself, but I‚Äôve noticed she also does it when ppl around her are drinking & she‚Äôs not, meaning she makes the conscious & sober decision to get grabby with girls around her, especially our close friend who happens to be her roommate & my cousin J (20f).

Both J & I have made it very clear to M that her behavior towards other women is creepy & predatory, but M always blames it on the alcohol or that she didn‚Äôt realize anyone was uncomfortable, even though J always tells M repeatedly to stop & I‚Äôve had to physically remove M from J several times.

After months of listening to M refusing to take responsibility for her actions & blaming everyone & everything but herself, I finally lost it.

My mother got remarried to a wealthy man that practically set her up financially (he died around 10 years ago). So obviously the will is of interest to the family. I was made the executor. There is a lot of money to sort through and the official reading won‚Äôt happen for a while. Before my mother died she gave me and my brother the rundown of who‚Äôs getting what and so forth.

It was a messy divorce, made messier by the fact that my dad quickly moved on with a younger coworker. My 3 older siblings were in their 20s when this happened, my younger sister and I were teenagers (I'm 24 now).

I only have one brother, and my dad is the kind of guy who thinks boys shouldn't cry and that liking artistic things is gay, that sort of toxic thing, and basically raised my brother in a less than healthy way. So naturally, my bro and my dad don't have a good relationship, and towards the beginning of the divorce, my bro was especially angry and lashed out at both my dad and dad's gf, and said things he shouldn't have. After this happened and for many times still to this day, my dad and stepmom (who I still do not like or get along with) use every opportunity they can to bring old things up and badmouth my bro to me and my sister, calling him all manner of names, degrading him because he has two kids out of wedlock, acting as if he's a loser junkie for smoking pot when he was like 20, etc. As I think any sibling would, I always get defensive when this happens, and have told them multiple times that I won't tolerate it and that it does nothing but make me upset with them. Yet they continue to do it, even as frequently as yesterday during an argument over text.

This latest argument stems from a facebook conflict, in which my uncle posted a very ignorant and thinly-veiled racist post about recent events, and my bro flew off the handle calling him and pretty much the whole rest of my dad's side of the family racist and ignorant and implicating my dad, (he's not wrong, but he did go over the top calling them out). A bunch of the offended aunts, uncles, and cousins flew to my uncle's defense, piling on my bro. I didn't like seeing that, so I commented that I disagreed with my bro's strong/harsh words but that I still loved him. Well, my dad and stepmom saw that as me defending and condoning my bro, who they thought was so obviously in the wrong, and have attacked me twice now for doing so.

They say I'm a hypocrite for being more lenient to my brother while not treating my dad and stepmom the same. My response is that of course I'm going to have a different reaction to someone I have a better relationship with than someone I have a strained relationship with. Yet I'm a weak, emotional hypocrite according to them, whose perspective on anything can't be trusted since I'm hypocritical.

I‚Äôm 18F and both of my roommates are 19 (one M, the other F) We‚Äôve all been friends for over 3 years, and decided to get a place together around 2 months ago! The place is beautiful and within our price ranges. 

My M roommate (let‚Äôs call him Tommy) has a large crush on me and doesn‚Äôt make it subtle. I knew this before we moved in, so that‚Äôs not a problem. 

However, since we started living together, Tommy has been unbearable with his flirting. He comes into my room without knocking (no locks) and does it especially while I‚Äôm sleeping. When I‚Äôm under the influence of any drugs or alcohol, he‚Äôs touchy and pushy. He doesn‚Äôt let me leave to hang out with my boyfriend (we have 1 car, so he drives me) because he gets extremely jealous. I‚Äôve asked him to stop doing what he‚Äôs doing and set a line. 

My other roommate (Bella) has told me she‚Äôs uncomfortable sometimes too, but tells me it‚Äôs not that serious and I don‚Äôt need to start anything over it, which I sort of agree with? 
The thing that set me over is that my friend who lives over 2,000 miles away got kicked out. We have an extra bedroom, so I said if he can get a way over, he‚Äôs free to stay here. I talked this over with both Bella and Tommy, they were down. 

They like him, friend likes them. It all worked out. Yesterday, however, I bring up that friend is coming over in less than 2 weeks and Tommy gets really quiet. He says he doesn‚Äôt want friend over because he‚Äôs worried I‚Äôm going to have sex with friend and Tommy tells me he doesn‚Äôt want friend staying anymore. 

I lost my shit. Friend has already mailed his stuff over and has a plane ticket and his savings in his pocket. We‚Äôve been planning this for over 2 months. Why didn‚Äôt he say anything before? 

So, I decided I want to cut my side of the lease early and move in with friend. Bella and Tommy can handle the place without my share, but they‚Äôll have to work more and harder. WIBTA if I left?

Normally a few times a week I watch my sister (13f) for a few hours while my dad is working (from home) and my mum is running errands. This is fine and we do stuff like watch movies and I paint her nails.
Part of her disability is that she has trouble communicating when she needs to go to the bathroom, so while we've been working on potty training, sometimes she is either too distracted (playing, watching a show, spacing out etc) to tell us, or she just doesn't tell us. Its frustrating but its reality. This ultimately means that she goes in her diaper and that someone needs to change it. 
Sometimes that means me, and it makes me uncomfortable, especially since she's beginning to start puberty. If no one else was home I wouldn't fuss or if my dad was in a meeting, but mostly hes just waiting for emails or scheduling calls. How do I bring this up to my parents without seeming selfish or lazy? The already get annoyed when I say I don't want to watch her for over 4 hours, so I feel like they won't take this well.

The next morning we were chilling outside and I asked him how he managed to find a replica and he said that he couldn't find one so he got it made especially for her. Over $7500.

I spoke to my gf and we were discussing what to do when the two off them started talking about them getting married later this year and having children soon after.

1stly, thank you for participating in my little enquiry and for giving your opinions. I did consider most of them quite seriously. 
Especially you guys who were debating the legal implications! You people are no fools. 
Anywho, the issue was resolved long before this ended and although I asked your opinions, I stand by my own instincts as being within my rights to question the ordeal purely based on the fact that she is not here and I was not taken into consideration. If you're going to take on a Tennant in your home who is going to be paying a fair amount of money to you for even just a room, then there is an obligation there to take them into that consideration. But, I subsequently didn't make a big deal out of it. Boyfriend and I simply went to go and stay somewhere else. All is well. 
Cheers, crew! Have a lovely day :)


So, here is the situation.

My bf and I are staying at mine during the current lockdown. It's a small two bed apartment in a major city in the UK. I rent a room from a lady who rents the apartment. 

She recently went home to another European country as the restrictions started to ease and plans to be there for at least another month. I am not back at work yet but my bf has been for the past week.

Today I got a message from my landlady saying that she has forgotten to tell me that her ex-husband is flying back to the UK tomorrow and that as his flight does not get in until around midnight she is going to give him a key so he can come stay in her room. He lives around two hours drive from the airport; does not have a car and so would be unable to get trains/buses home at that hour.

Initially I said that it was a little strange and asked if he could not just get a taxi home but that it was her place so who was I to question it. However in thinking about it and talking with my bf I don't like the idea of a strange man letting himself into the place I am living in the middle of the night. 

In my previous conversations with her she has told me that he has been emotionally abusive and not a nice man. I have met him only once and that was only a 'hello, nice to meet you' thing. Therefore I don't know him. He has not been sold as a particularly amiable human being and I don't feel comfortable with it. She has also said that he would be set to leave at around midday the next day. 

Forgive me if I'm wrong but it seems a bit weird. I don't see how he'd be comfortable with it, nvm myself and my bf. Also, why leave around midday under those circumstances? Surely go home asap because for the exact reasoning as above: we don't know him and he's the crappy ex-husband. We're not going to be super friendly people. That, and this is petty, but I'd be pissed if he wakes up and starts making himself breakfast from our food. I'm skint, guys, don't eat my food. 

So, upon considering this, I have messaged her again, restating my case and saying more firmly that I'm not ok with it and I'm not prepared to bite the bullet and wait for the storm to pass. This was 3hrs ago and she hasn't responded. To be honest, I don't think she will so my bf and I will probably just go and stay somewhere else for the night. Also not great.

I also think that I have a say 'cause it's her house, yes, but she's not here, as we said, and I pay no small amount to live here. I.e i'm paying for comfort and safety. 

So, what do you think?

I didn't know about this until a few months in which makes sense. I wouldn't want to talk about it on the first date. Whenever she mentions things like that she talks about how great the money is but claims she hated doing it. Since her old social media is still up albeit inactive, she has a lot of followers and she could make a lot of money if she started up again.
She recently found out about Onlyfans and every now and then hints the possibility of making an account to make some extra cash. She always talks about other people who she knows that do it and she talks about the easy money that they make in such an envious way.
When she brought it up first she said she wasn't going to post much of her body and would never be nude or show her face. But when she started being active on old SM again she immediately got requests to make nude content (photos and videos)for $100-200 and was ready to do it. She got mad when I said I didn't want that saying that I ""said I was okay with it at first."" She ended up not doing any of it but lately she is making it very obvious that she wants to be doing this even though she still claims to hate it and still says she wouldn't want to be recognized and she is acting like she holds a grudge against me for not ""letting"" her.
The things that I said when this blew up before is that I felt like the sexual nature of our relationship was personal and was special to me and I asked if she made an Onlyfans account would she be okay with me paying for other girls accounts. She said no why would you spend money on other girls when you have me for free. I don't want to spend money on Onlyfans accounts but I was trying to make a point. It seems like of that is the case then she shouldn't do it. I have expressed that I won't stop her and that it's her body and her choice but I have also expressed how it would make me feel and so she is acting like I'm stopping her from doing it. So she hasn't done it but is resenting me for the way I feel about it when she would like to show off her body and make money she says I won't let her. Does this Make me an asshole? Does it make her an asshole? It's like she is respecting what I want but she resents me for it which doesn't feel like respect at all just more like spite.",False,False,2020-07-09 15:33:05

My uncle isn‚Äôt particularly a wealthy man, but he has some estate and some saving set aside for his children, my four cousins, to inherit. He has been fighting severe health problems and has been talking about death a lot, as if preparing for the end. We all have a bad feeling he won‚Äôt make it through this year.

One of my cousins, let‚Äôs call him Axel, has been banking on his inheritance from his father. The problem arises with Axel‚Äôs personality and his relationship with his siblings.

My other cousin, let‚Äôs call him Jon, owns some apartments that he rents out. Four years ago, he let Axel stay with him, which ended with Jon calling the police on Axel because his brother had done some awful things in the apartment. I won‚Äôt say what exactly, as it can be identifying information, but it ended in Jon and his wife starting proceedings for a restraining order between Axel and their three children, as well as Jon pressing charges against Axel for a variety of things.

The boys settled it quietly, and never told their father - not even our grandmother, who is the gossip monger of the family, knows what happened. Only my cousins, myself, and my mother, whom Jon asked legal advice from (she was not his lawyer) know what happened.

Jon was venting to me about it, saying how much trouble it has been for him and Axel keeps harassing their other brothers about the will their father will leave, trying to weasel his way around and get more than them. Axel is the only one without a family, doesn‚Äôt own a home, and constantly bounces between apartments. He thinks he needs more of the inheritance so he can finally settle down.

I have nothing to gain from this inheritance; it‚Äôs clear cut it will only go between my uncle‚Äôs four boys. But, after Jon told me the details of what Axel did in the apartment, as well as what he has been doing to his brothers, I feel like my uncle deserves to know so that he can make an informed decision of what happens to his money and the benefit of his children and subsequently, his grandchildren.

I offered to Jon to tell his father as I am technically a neutral party, with nothing to gain or lose in this situation, but my mother was furious. She thinks Axel needs the inheritance so that he can have a fresh start and I shouldn‚Äôt be poking my nose into money affairs, and I can sort of see her concerns. But I feel like my uncle should know what his son did.

WIBTA if I told my uncle about my cousin so that he can alter his will accordingly?

EDIT: To answer some questions:

What was Jon‚Äôs response to my offer? - He said I could do it if I wanted, but he wouldn‚Äôt encourage me one way or the other.

Why can‚Äôt the brothers tell their father? - They worry the stress of the news would affect him, as well as they worry it would look like they are trying to cut one brother out to benefit themselves when that isn‚Äôt the case. Their worry of Axel getting the inheritance is in him being able to continue what he did in Jon‚Äôs apartment, or pay bail if he got caught.

If Axel did something criminal, why aren‚Äôt the police involved/isn‚Äôt Axel in jail? - the police were involved when the initial event happened, but Axel was released for lack of evidence.

Why haven‚Äôt the brothers decided to do it themselves anyways? - They want it to be all three or none at all. Two of the brothers agree, but Jon is the one holding out and since he was directly involved with the event, the brothers won‚Äôt go through with it. 

Can you give us information about what Axel did? - It has to do with children. That is all I am willing to say. ",False,1594740704.0,2020-07-14 14:05:09

My personal relationship with them is pretty neutral as I spend most of my time in my room to avoid any conflict, but my younger brother spends a lot more time doing stuff with them, like playing games and watching TV. This sometimes leads to arguments between them, as my younger brother can at times be flat out rude and say things he shouldn't have. However, this isn't always the case.  


Ever since right after my Dad and Stepmom got married, she has always kind of hinted at us calling her something other than ""Stepmom"", primarily that just being ""Mom"". Me and my brother were always pretty uncomfortable with this considering our actual Mom is still very much in our lives, but we always just kind of played it off with a joke or something. As time goes on though, every time it gets brought up there's more tension that comes with it.

&#x200B;

Not too long ago, while I was out of the room, Stepmom put my brother on the phone with her mother, someone who neither of us have ever actually met, but my brother has talked to her on the phone a few times prior to this time. Every time they talk, she tells my brother to call her Grandma or Nana, even though we have zero connection to her in the first place. He always just goes with a ""Sure thing"" and then leaves it at that, not trying to be rude, but just not feeling comfortable with it. This caused the previously mentioned topic to be brought up again, because after they got off the phone, my Stepmom starts to get on his case about how he never actually calls her mom ""Grandma"" or herself ""Mom"". It escalated into an argument where her and my Dad were talking to him about how much our Stepmom does for him, and how the least he could do is call her ""Mom"", telling him that he's just being rude and has terrible people skills. He eventually just left the room, leaving them to talk about it.

Yesterday he brought her over to the house to meet us. I came into the living room to sit with them with my parents and my boyfriend and...it was very uncomfortable.

I made the apparently HUGE mistake of microwaving ramen, and going back out to the couch to eat it with chopsticks. Sam walks into the room and tells me to ‚Äústop being so rude‚Äù. I, confused, said ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù And she told me to stop appropriating her culture and making fun of it. I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I just kind-of stared at her and after a moment said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm upsetting you, I didn‚Äôt mean to, but I‚Äôm not changing the way I‚Äôm eating.‚Äù Sam stomped out of the room, and I went back to my show.

Beth comes in about 30 minutes later and says that Sam is really upset that I‚Äôm eating Cheetos and microwaveable ramen with chopsticks, and that while she doesn‚Äôt agree with Sam, I should stop to keep the peace. I said that I was sorry if my actions made her that upset, but that I wasn‚Äôt going to not eat with chopsticks just because it upset Sam. 

Beth is now pretty much mutual in all of this. Sam posted on Facebook about white supremacy and mockery of her race, not mentioning my name, but saying that it was embarrassing that those close to her were so horrible.

Now, most of her friends are telling me that I‚Äôm being rude by eating ‚Äúimproper‚Äù foods with chopsticks, and that I‚Äôm insulting her culture and being a bad friend by refusing to stop. Two of our mutual friends are on my side, but the rest are angry with me. Beth and I were having dinner tonight (asked Sam if she wanted anything but she said she wasn‚Äôt hungry) and Sam came out in the middle of it and said that she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel like she was in a safe environment‚Äù and that she‚Äôd be moving back in with her parents. 

Acting like this is completely unlike her, so I‚Äôm really confused. Maybe I am doing something wrong? I don‚Äôt know, AITA reddit?",False,False,2020-07-13 03:31:04

He's known me since i was like 13, and since about 2018 we've been chatting regularly. I send him selfies, he sends back heart emoji's, says he misses me, etc. 

My sister thinks it's creepy that he talks to me and constantly reminds me that she's had s\*x with him (ew, tmi.)

The McDonalds I was in was pretty damn busy. I ordered my food, and it had to be cooked. I stood to one side while I waited. It was then given to me without my drink. I asked for my drink and they said ""it is coming""

10-minutes I stood. I asked for my drink, the server said ""yeah yeah. It is coming. I have all these customers to deal with first""

Now, I don't know about you, but in my mind, dealing with other customers shouldn't be a thing when you have previously served customers WAITING for something as simple as a damn drink.

15-minutes, I said ""Can I have my drink yet? My food is getting cold"". The response was ""I told you to WAIT""

20-minutes, I said ""give me my fucking drink"" I actually said it in a raised tone, but not shouting.

The server took my food away and asked me to leave for being ""rude""

I snatched my food back, hopped over the counter and poured my own damn Fanta.

I was being recorded on somebody's phone at this point and they said ""we gonna YouTube this shit"". That is why i waited to post. I didn't want to be identified. However, it seems that video was never posted or nobody ever cared about it.

I waited 20 minutes for a drink to be poured. 20 minutes with cold food PLUS the additional 10 minutes of waiting for the food to be prepared, to begin with. That is 30-minutes. I felt I was more patient than most would have been. I didn't say anything for the first 10-minutes. I knew they were busy. But you got to draw the line somewhere, right?

I told her around 4 pm I would be going and staying out late probably until 12 or 1 am. She gave the usual speech: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go‚Äù, ‚Äúhave them come over here‚Äù, ‚Äúcome home early‚Äù, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sleep when you‚Äôre not in the house‚Äù, etc. I told her I would check in at 9 and call at 12 to let her know if I‚Äôm coming home yet or not. Well, come 9 I completely forgot to text her and ended up checking my phone around 10:30 and found 9 missed calls! I text her back saying I‚Äôm safe and still out. This is where things went south. She then proceeds to call and text me every hour yelling at me to come home, that I don‚Äôt love her, that I‚Äôm raising her blood pressure and I want to kill her.

898,AITA for Getting Mad About How Late my BF Stays Up?,18,Not the A-hole,54,hrev3n,1594807116.0,"My (28F) boyfriend (28M) often stays up really late, especially when drinking. It‚Äôs always been an issue for me in our 4+ year relationship because I hate sleeping in till 1,2, or 3pm. It makes me feel guilty and gross sleeping that late for some reason. I don‚Äôt mind staying up late (like 2 or 3 am) but he stays up till 5,6,7,8am+ sometimes. 

Initially I kind of conformed to his schedule because I wanted to spend time with him even though I did voice it as being a concern. Eventually I told him I wanted to change our sleep schedule and since then its been a battle. A back and forth of sometimes him agreeing with me and other times he gets angry and says I‚Äôm trying to control him/tell him what to do. 

I have a hard time sleeping without him which is not his fault, but the other (and main) issue is that I want us to spend time together, eat together etc. If I wake up at 10am and him at 3pm, we‚Äôre not going to be on the same eating/hanging schedule at all so it doesn‚Äôt feel like ‚Äúyou just go to bed and let him stay up‚Äù is an option for our relationship. If I‚Äôm not spending time with my spouse, eating with him and doing activities together then what‚Äôs the point? 

Last night he stayed up till 8am drinking and playing poker and the noises from the game kept me up. Before playing poker I asked if he could try to go to bed before sunrise, and he said he would try. He got drunk and stayed up late and I couldn‚Äôt sleep so I was really angry when I didn‚Äôt wake up till 2pm today because we had JUST gotten our sleep schedule to a decent time/routine. I‚Äôm wondering at this point if we just enjoy/want different things out of life simply bc of our sleep schedules. We love playing poker together and watching our shows, and have a great time together but this has been a consistent issue in our lives. 
When I was upset this morning..er afternoon, he got mad that I was mad and said there‚Äôs no reason I should care since we‚Äôre both out of work with nothing to do so it doesn‚Äôt matter and I just want to control him. My absolute truth is that I want us on the same schedule for the reasons listed above. Im tired of this battle and need some input if I am just being controlling for wanting what I want. It‚Äôs confusing for me because he‚Äôs so big on us spending time together, eating together etc that it feels like he just wants me to conform to his schedule. Im completely lost. Am I in the wrong here? Am I the asshole?

Edit: I just want to add some clarity; we tried his schedule for 3 years but I was only sleeping 4 hours a night on that schedule because of work, and then would come home to take a nap. He started to feel bad about how late he was staying up/then sleeping in, because of his own issues (procrastinating, not being able to run errands bc of sleeping too late, not finishing school work on time etc) and felt we needed a change too. However, like I said, since he‚Äôs felt that way, it‚Äôs been a back and forth and maybe that‚Äôs where some of my anger and frustration comes in, in that HE wanted a change-all on his own- and maybe I got my hopes up and now I feel let down. Lastly, we stay at my house, where I pay all the bills, rent, everything. I once suggested he start staying at his place if he was going to be up so late (bc it keeps me up from the game/tv/him going in and out to smoke) and he blew up and felt like I was trying to break up with him. 
I can still understand why I may be the asshole though and do sound controlling. Thanks for the input.",False,1594779707.0,2020-07-15 02:58:36

It was small, Reasonably priced, and had the added value of the teacher speaking French to her students which was helpful because I wanted her to be as fully immersed and I can only do so much at home when I return to work. I gave the info to my husband for him to make the final decision and he decided he wanted us to wait on him getting his school schedule back (he's has a rough draft of it since about mid June), despite him saying that we would plan AROUND daycare, not the other way around. Covid has basically screwed with his school schedule so much that he still doesn't have a finalized plan and school starts next month.

Something told me to call today to check and see if they still had any openings and she told me sorry all booked up until 2023. I was heartbroken. I told husband this and hinted towards the fact that we were too late signing up that's why we can't get in. He then began to scramble and make a plan that involved multiple uses of babysitters, us potentially being sleep deprived to care for her, and him potentially taking her to class with him (which I'm not particularly fond of since Covid is a thing). He asked me for my work schedule (which is a rotating schedule Morning/evening/night every two weeks) I gave it to him and told him make a plan and let me know. He's now upset with me because I'm not making active involvement in the planning for child care but honestly I'm not because I don't want to waste my energy. If he wants us to have an ass backwards plan for caring for her, that's fine so long as it is a clear plan.

But the bottom line is that I am the one who currently pays for LITERALLY all the pet food, toys, supplies, and veterinary expenses. With 4 pets this is not cheap. Now my mother brings this cat home, that means more expenses, not to mention i don't know how to care for cats. My brother said he is willing to help with expenses and care but i know this is an empty promise because he has enlisted in the military and will be leaving in a month for training.

So I argue with parents and brother for a bit. Then in comes our dogs, he sniffs the cat, and the cat swings and starts attacking the dog. Mother blames dog, starts yelling at him, and i become livid. My dog is 12 years old, has a heart condition, and is smaller than the cat, I will defend him tooth and nail because i love him so much. So when i see the cat attack my dog I put my foot down and tell my parents ""That cat has no place in this house, it is a danger to the birds AND the dog. If you don't get rid of it I WILL!""

I‚Äôve since graduated and got a high paying job and pay all of my own bills. Also, since I moved away, my parents‚Äô finances are also more comfortable since they don‚Äôt have a child to support, but they‚Äôre still in the old mindset about money.

I was visiting them this weekend. For dinner, I said I‚Äôd go and get some takeout (dine-in is still closed); and since I‚Äôm picking it up, I‚Äôm also paying for it (which is not a big deal for me at all, but it‚Äôs a relevant detail later). So my parents suggested a cuisine and ask me a place that serves it. I remembered this new place for that cuisine that my friend K had taken me to a few months back and i loved it, but my parents have yet to try it. So I suggest this place and show my parents the menu and ask them for their orders.

They do, but then my dad noticed the prices and becomes alarmed at how high the prices are. To be sure, it‚Äôs not cheap for the area: about 1.5x to 2x the typical prices. But, in the city that I live in now, these prices would be typical. So I tell my dad this, and since I‚Äôm paying anyway, that he shouldn‚Äôt worry about this since I‚Äôm more than comfortable with the prices. He‚Äôs not having it and now both my parents are asking me to find a cheaper place. I ask them if they knew of a cheaper place that has the cuisine they really wanted to eat, and they didn‚Äôt. So then they say that any restaurant would do as long as it‚Äôs cheaper. I think I said something along the lines of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be ridiculous, I‚Äôm your son, I want to spend this money and it‚Äôs not that much money anyway.‚Äù

So I go and get the food (against their wishes) since I know their orders anyway. We eat and my parents like the food. But my dad still huffed a bit as I was setting the table about it being ‚Äúwasting money.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt take this as anything more than a harmless dad joke at the time. 

But, later that day, I told K this story (in the context of thanking him for showing me the place), but K got a little quiet and told me that I shouldn‚Äôt dismiss my dad‚Äôs remark like that, and I may have forced my parents into an uncomfortable situation for them, and they only didn‚Äôt speak up because I paid and so there was a power imbalance.

Due to abuse, she cut off all contact with her dad. He wants a relationship but doesn't reach out to my wife. Instead, he sends messages through the family to guilt her & make her look bad. My wife says she used to try to fix it, but he doesn't wish to change & wants her to accept abuse. Her family knows: They find it funny to put her situations of discomfort like telling her dad she wants to talk to him & attempting to foster situations for interactions when he's around. They do this only for enjoyment & to make her uncomfortable.

They also constantly make fun of my wife & pretty much look for things to attack her(looks, intelligence, opinions, & behavior.) To clarify my wife is gorgeous, intelligent, & well-rounded so these taunts are baseless. She is a good sport although it bothers her. They consider her the family ""dunce"" despite the fact she has more success & beauty. This took a toll on her coming up leading to low self-esteem & self-views. My wife cried the first time I complimented her b/c ""Nobody's ever told me, I was good at anything.""

As well they use the hell out of my wife. My wife breaks her back to do for her family to help them at her own expense.

Well I had enough this holiday, a few of my relatives came to visit & we hosted at our house. My wife was super excited to cook & have both families. She cooked everything.  Her family made jokes on her all night. It was evident she was embarrassed by their behavior. Her cousins came & I wasn't prepared for the vitriol unleashed. Eventually, the topic was to discuss the abuse leading up to an attempt on her life when she was younger leading her to stay in a psych ward(which was done to avoid having charges filed). I never knew about this. I could tell she was so embarrassed & hurt she couldn't look at anyone especially me. I've never seen my wife look so small. I could tell she wanted to die on the spot. She excused herself for the evening. Later, I could tell she had been crying but didn't want to talk about it.

That was the final straw. I could no longer sit by & allow them to tear her down. I kicked them out & told them not to return. They shrugged it off & stated I overreacted. I spoke to my wife & suggested we limited the contact. She became upset & said it wasn't my place to speak to her family about those things & that she can't abandon her family.

I told her I no longer could engage with them if they could not treat her better. She told me she felt that she was being made to choose between me & them. I feel bad for making my wife feel this way, but she will not defend herself. Please tell me the truth, AITA?",False,False,2020-07-13 03:46:33
906,AITA for wanting to name my next dog something like Mustard?,19,Not the A-hole,57,hq68xm,1594632524.0,"Can you all help us settle a (not so serious) multi-day argument? A few days ago, my bf and I were discussing dog names as I've been considering getting another dog. I mentioned that I think food names are particularly cute and that you could probably name a dog after any food and it would work. My boyfriend disagreed, saying that not all food names are created equal. I used the example of a blonde wiener dog named Mustard and told him I would love to name my next dog something like that! 

Things started to get heated quickly though and he said it was ridiculous. That dog names should be two syllables and preferably end in a vowel and ‚Äúthat naming a dog something like Milk is ridiculous. Food doesn‚Äôt make sense as a name.‚Äù I fired back at him that maybe the dog was named after Harvey Milk and that obviously ‚ÄúMilk‚Äù worked as a name. His argument to that was ‚ÄúMilk‚Äù was his last name and you don‚Äôt get to change it. I said you obviously could change your last name (having changed mine previously lol). 

We keep going back and forth about it and it came to a head again today when he came back from the dog park. He complained that he met a dog named Toast (though he stands by the fact that it‚Äôs a better name than Milk). I thought it was a great name and couldn't stop laughing!

907,AITA for trying to stay positive?,17,No A-holes here,17,hppqho,1594563731.0,"My partner (24M) and I (24M) have been together about 3 years, and we've lived together for about 2 years, but the last week has absolutely been the worst, and I'm not sure if there's anything more I could've done to make things any better.

We both have issues, but our relationship has been a healthy one. Certainly we're not perfect, but we've always been here for each other and we're very clear about what is and isn't okay for us. I don't like when I'm coerced to do things I'm uncomfortable with or when physical confrontation is brought up, and he doesn't like me raising my voice or being passive-aggressive.

Then this week started. Our AC went out on Sunday, and we have been struck by a heatwave. Our landlady has promised us that it would be fixed four times now, and so far something has come up every time. They gave us a portable unit, but it's not very powerful.

Meanwhile, he went outside the apartment for the first time the other day. It was just a trip to the store, we picked out some snacks and had a night in, nothing big, but it was a big deal for him as his first trip out. He also has OCD, so his fear of contracting the virus is very high, and I think he was very brave to challenge his disorder like that.

Every time that our AC's repair got delayed I tried to stay positive and say it'll be fixed tomorrow, as promised. He's kinda freaked out about our state's corona stuff, and every time he freaks out I tell him that he's not been out anywhere, and I've been extremely safe, he's okay.

Tonight, we learned that a dear friend of ours who lives a few hours away is living with someone who is sick. I think that news broke something in him, and he got upset. Just yelling and freaking out and hyperventilating, all coming back around to ""I went out yesterday and now I KNOW I am sick, and about to die."" I responded by saying that we've been safe, and I'm just as concerned for our friend but we've not seen them in months, so we're okay.

I tried not to, but I did raise my voice a little to get him to stop screaming. He asserted that I was being insensitive because I yelled at him, and he stormed off. Since he left, he's been making a racket upstairs, and it sounds like he's just been hitting some empty boxes form our last move. Despite me not actually thinking he's going to hurt himself or me, it has definitely activated a trauma response from my last relationship.

He's been blaming me for being passive, patronizing, and raising my voice. I think he's been aggressive and unreasonable. I don't think any of this would have happened if we hadn't been subjected to prolonged stressors with multiple promised fixes that haven't manifested this week. So, I feel like my passiveness has greatly exacerbated his problems and my ongoing attempts to stay positive have only made him mad, since it seems like I'm not doing anything and I don't care about his problems.

So I'm well aware this is a small situation and I know we'll be over it by tomorrow, but I just want to know if I was in the wrong.

So little background: I hate mayo. I can eat a lot of things with mayo, like potato salad, chicken salad and (something I'm sad to find out) ranch. But I hate mayo as far as on my sandwiches and stuff. This is something I've picked up from my dad when I was young. He also used to hate may on his sandwiches. Ironically he can now eat lite mayo on his sandwiches which I've tried but now I just hate the texture so I still don't eat them on my sandwiches.

Anyway so a couple of days ago he went out to get me Krystals which I've heard is basically ""southern-version of White Castle"" as in they both specialize in the little slider burgers. He said me he told them no mayo, but it still did have mayo on them and *a lot*. I was obviously displeased but I didn't complain about it because obviously it wasn't his fault. I simply just used some napkins to wipe it off and went on with my day.

Fast forward to today and he asked me to go get some food for both of us and he'll pay. I said sure, he gave me his order and I left

Now I don't check food *all the time* but I do sometimes, more specifically just to check to make sure my burger doesn't have mayo. But this was one of the times I didn't bother checking. Sometimes it just doesn't be in the forefront of my mind.

I get back and give my dad his food and he literally *throws a fit.* Now I'm not sure how exactly you could go wrong with chicken fingers and fries, but apparently they do. But it wasn't the chicken fingers and fries, it was literally because *the sauce.* Usually my dad asks for 2 sauces but I guess because I didn't ask for it (not purposely I just don't usually get my dads food) they only gave one sauce and he had the nerve to say if I did it because I was upset that my food had mayo on it.

I told him I didn't and it was just an accident but that I wasn't going back because I it was a long way to go just for some sauce. And literally its over a sauce. He said I still should've checked the bag. Anyway he's been throwing a hissy fit all day and I was just wondering if I was TA.",False,False,2020-07-12 00:26:32
912,AITA for making a scene at my boyfriend's aunt's wedding?,18,Not the A-hole,15,hp6p3m,1594485418.0,"So when I first started dating my boyfriend, I met his aunt. She has 5, soon to be 6 kids, two of them are twins (one boy one girl) at age 8, two are her now stepchildren (9 and 11), and a baby age 3. She's pregnant right now. 

So 3 years ago, I went to my boyfriend's house and she was on the couch yelling ""I hate you, why can't you be more like X"" to her 5 year old daughter while kicking her away from herself and the baby. The daughter kept saying ""but mom I drew a picture of us"". I have held resentment since then.

The second incident, I was at one of their family parties and the little girl, C, asked me if I could get her a cookie. I told her yes and went to hand it to her before her mother smacked my hand, making me drop the cookie. I asked her why she did that and I was told that her children aren't allowed to have sugar. I didn't think much of that and assumed that it was because children are hyperactive. Later that night, at dinner, I noticed C wasn't eating. I asked her why and she told me her mom wouldnt let her.

There were a few cases the like the second where I wouldn't see her eat anything. She was always thankful for me passing her food when her mom wasn't looking.

Now the Aunt met her 3rd husband while she was stripping. She invited us to the wedding and after getting really drunk, announced she was pregnant. After that and I had a few drinks to calm myself down, I noticed I didn't see X anywhere. I went up and asked her about it and she said she didn't want to deal with him so she gave him some alcohol and left him ALONE in a room to sleep. I snapped and started yelling at her. I told her she is an abusive mother who shouldn't be allowed to have children. I went to go find X

Everyone is now mad at me for making a scene at her wedding. After we both calmed down, I told her I would take and adopt C if she wanted me to. She said yes but would always back. She would then tell me that I have no place telling her she's a bad mom since I don't have children. 

Although I have considered calling CPS, I was in the system at her age and got abused on multiple occasions. I am not willing to put the child through that and have made the decision to do everything in my power to keep her out of foster care. I am not direct family so would not gain custody of her daughter. I do not want to have her in the hands of the relatives because they gaslight her. I have been and am continuing to discuss with the Aunt about adopting C.

AITA for making a scene at her wedding and judging how she is as a mom? I don't know what their life looks like outside of social interactions, and feel bad for judgement. I feel very strongly about child abuse and tend to be quick with assumptions. However, the Aunt is extremely difficult to talk to about the situation because she starts gaslighting ME, an adult.",False,False,2020-07-11 09:36:58
913,AITA for not being able to forgive my dad?,18,Not the A-hole,14,hp4an6,1594472252.0,"My dad was my entire world, until the summer of 2018. He called me and my four siblings, including the 4 year old twins into the living room to tell us he was leaving forever. To make sure nobody got hurt. 3 days before, he and my mom had this huge blowout fight. Not sure what about. I was 12 at the time. After he drove away i cried for about 2 seconds and then something snapped. I broke. I started on dinner for everyone, called my mom and told her what happened, and begged her to come home from work. Everyone else was crying as I set the twins dinner on the table. I felt nothing. My sisters birthday was about 3 days later. My mom said I didn't have to go with my dad to get dinner, but I wanted to celebrate her, so I toughed it out. I didnt realize it but I was anxious to be around him. When he hugged me I couldn't breathe; he felt like a stranger. At dinner, I played mom once again, getting food for the twins, making sure they had used the bathroom before we left. I mentioned to my dad, mistakenly, that mom was considering moving home with us to Alabama, as she had no support in VA. That night he stayed in the basement. And the night following. His exact words were ""Y'all wanted ya daddy back, well now he's back"". I didn't care honestly. Mind you this happens after years of my dad bashing deadbeat daddies and broken families only to create one of his own. I couldn't be around him for extended periods of time. I was hurt, broken, anxious an depressed. I lost 28 pounds because I wouldn't eat much. I cried almost everyday. 2 months later, my birthday rolled around. Dinner date and the musical Hamilton for my thirteenth. Nearly unable to enjoy it because the whole time I wanted to cry. ""You have the chance of a relationship with your father that I didn't get"" my mom said. Difference is i didn't want it. I didn't need it. Whatever broke that day is gone forever. Fast forward 2 years. Nearly the anniversary of his speech in the living room. I'm almost 15 now. My dad never forgave me for my behavior in the past 2 years. Forgive me for feeling abandoned and unwanted. Treats me good when he feels like it, and treats me like crap on the same terms. (recently stated that I will be a slut if I listen to what music I listen to, the books I read, the boys I like etc. has convinced himself I have no self-control, and that I am an irresponsible spoiled brat) My mom gave in, so they're good. Better than ever actually. I resent her for leaving me in the dust, I though she was on my side. At this point I feel almost obligated to forgive him, but he was never sorry. Not once did he apologize, or say he was wrong. Not once did he say it wasn't my fault. I'm not as broken as I was. I gained the weight back, I eat a lot. The anxiety is in progress. Everyone else forgave him but me. I don't think I can without an apology. AITA for that?

I do, however, have an issue with how he behaves when he's frustrated at the games. He tends to get loud and he tends to get really testy if I interrupt him. Since he plays for hours at a time, I usually do need to ask him something from time to time. 

We decided to eat out tonight; I suggested my favorite pizza place, and he agreed. I gave him some time to think about what he wanted to eat, and finally, about thirty minutes later, when he was between matches, I guess, he told me he wanted a ""meat pizza."" Since he had taken so long to let me know, I was in the middle of watching a video on YouTube. It might have been five minutes before the video was over, and I asked him what he wanted specifically on his pizza, since ""meat pizza"" isn't a menu item, and I didn't want to guess as to which of the pizzas with meat. 

I ask, but he has his headphones on, as usual. I say, ""babe"" a little louder than I asked my question to get his attention. He jerks the headphones off his ear and says ""WHAT"" really loudly. Before I can even answer, he says, ""What, what, WHAT?"" again. Here, I will note that the pizza place is closing in an hour, and often, if you don't order an hour+ ahead of closing, the order gets canceled, so I needed to put it in ASAP. 

So I said, ""forget it,"" because I refuse to be treated that way and then ""reward"" him, so I sent the order through with just my pizza in the cart. He says this was childish. Maybe it was. He says I am always waiting until he's in the middle of something he needs to concentrate on when I ask him questions, when he ""can't hear shit"" as if that excuses being rude to me.

I did it for a couple of reasons, but I let him know before I even asked that it would be temporary. We talk a little bit before I go there, he tells me he has a spare room for me, that our other brother was staying there, but he can sleep on an air mattress in the living room and he'll be fine. Note, this is a very, very small house and on a pretty shitty side of town. 

On the 2nd day I was here, both their cars broke down, because they were pretty junk to begin with, so they asked if they could borrow money to get a vehicle. I paid 1700 on the down payment for their car. Mostly, I did it for the kids.  When I got there I also paid 2 months rent up front (400 total) because their rent was overdue and I was told if I didn't show up, they wouldn't know what they'd have done. No cars, 3 kids, and only 1 of them had a job. They made it VERY apparent that I helped them lot and that without me there to help them, etc. 

2 weeks later my brother asks for 100 to buy some vices. I agree. Next week, same thing. I say no, but he guilt trips me and I feel a little threatened that he'll kick me out or something. So roughly every week I lent him another 60-100 dollars. I don't mind , though I do give him a little bit of shit that he already owes me money.

We talk a little about all 3 of us getting a house together. Then I tell them that I'll be going to move out of state as soon as I'm more stable in life and that's when things take a bad turn. He gets really mad at me, says I'm abandoning them, that I'm selfish, that I think I'm better than him that I'm too good for our current state (Florida) and that I hate his kids. All of comes out of nowhere to me. 

Fast-forward 2 weeks more weeks and is overdue again, but they have 0 money and have chosen the car payments over a house. Mind you, I don't have a car so this is the only vehicle. He tries to guilt trip me into paying the 900 rent fee, but next month rent is due soon so it would be really be like 1800 and I just got the feeling that he would just try to get me to pay the next month's rent too. He guilt trips me, ""We'll have to go into a rat/cockroach infested motel where they charge 200 a week, or you can pay rent."" I tell him that I guess we'll all be going to motels. Next day, he says everything will be fine, they will have the money for the rent and it's swell. 2 days later it completely 180's and everything is not ok, that on the 25th when rent is due they're going to a motel. So I ask myself out loud what I should do.

Later he sends me a bunch of texts saying that he's tired of me that I'm selfish that I don't care about his family and when I was told they'd go to motels all I had to say was, ""What should I do, should I go there, or there?"" And that in 2 weeks when they left, that I could go fuck myself. He won't actually discuss anything with me though, just gets mad and tells me to fuck off.",False,False,2020-07-10 00:03:14

I gently told him no, I think he should be the one to do it. I'd be happy to fill in gaps in knowledge he had, but since he's Rosie's sole parent he needs to be there so she knows he's not ashamed or embarrassed by her period and is someone to go to for help. (I personally know how it feels to have an unsupportive father that's embarrassed by female bodily functions). I told John that after he talks to Rosie and she actually starts her period I'd be happy to sit down with her and have a ""girl-to-girl"" talk as well.

John insisted he wasn't embarrassed or unsupportive, but didn't want to make his daughter uncomfortable talking about her ""private parts"" with her dad. I told him she'd only be uncomfortable if *he* made it uncomfortable. We didn't have any kind of crazy fight, but he backed off asking me, although I'm unsure if he'll listen to my advice.

My husband thinks maybe I should have given in because John's been through a lot, but I'm looking out for Rosie too. She needs her father to be a safe person to go to about personal matters since she no longer has a mother figure to turn to.

For the last year or so he‚Äôs been really struggling financially, to the extent where he owes me over ¬£3000.

It‚Äôs not his fault, he‚Äôs just been messed over by the coronavirus and switching jobs at the wrong time, resulting in him not being able to claim furlough or universal credit due to my earnings. Him starting in September would mean he wouldn‚Äôt be working full time in order to pay me back and because the college course isn‚Äôt a degree, he wouldn‚Äôt be able to get a student loan.

He is very upset about it as he‚Äôs 22 and thinks 23 is too late to start university. But I know for a fact that I will have to cover for him again for the next year and I just don‚Äôt want to pay for him anymore. Plus my mum and dad are getting upset about it too.

At the end of the shift, our Team manager has a meeting with everybody from the shift, including each of the individual team leads like myself.

After the meeting is over and the grunt level employees are officially given the go ahead to leave, the TM and the TLs hang back for 30 minutes or so to discuss various things about the shift, usually complaints regarding problematic employees.

One employee in particular was force Removed from the Video Meeting because she was not leaving even though everyone else had logged off.

So she has been gone a few minutes, and we are discussing problems with employees with the TM. Then she rejoins the meeting, a solid 10 minutes after she was removed and off the clock.

My response because we did not want this employee hearing anything they should not be hearing was:

 ""Miranda(employee), go away please."" 

Not perfect, but we were in the middle of potentially determining whether or not to fire somebody when she popped in.

She logged off, and I sent a quick message apologizing, saying that we were discussing information that she did not need to be a part of.

Well she complained to her TL, and has become increasingly passive-aggressive in the ensuing months. Which was not a problem as she is not on my team, however she is now included in my morning recap meetings with my team due to some scheduling changes.

For the most part it is fine, since she is not actually part of my team and I do not need to work with her beyond a couple of minutes first thing in the morning. However, these recap meetings occur at 6am and I ask everyone to be logged in and ready to go a couple minutes beforehand so that we can get everything squared away. Her response this past Monday at 5:59am when everyone else was logged on and ready to go and just waiting on her was ""Well, the meeting is at 6am. It's not 6am yet.""

925,WIBTA if I asked for a new birthday present?,15,Not the A-hole,18,hrdp0h,1594802501.0,"I just want to start off by saying I feel like a spoiled ungrateful child in this situation. Sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile. 

It was my birthday recently and my mom came to be the day before and said she was going to get the afternoon off work to spend with me on my birthday. She ended up having to work, which was completely fine. I know she's been having alot of deadlines lately and I completely understand, olus I enjoyed my chill alone time. Birthdays were never a huge thing in my family. You get a special birthday dinner on the weekend and a cake and maybe a small present. 

The problem is that my mom got me a ""present"" which was just something she needed to buy for the house and had been planning on doing but tried to pass it off as my birthday present when I didn't need or want that as my birthday present. In the past she has always asked me what I wanted and got me something like that within reason. This year I was going to ask for a new computer chair since my old one is 12 years old and no longer has a back or arm rests. 

But, three weeks before my birthday, my dad broke the bluray player which streams and so he cannot watch Netflix anymore. This has been driving him crazy because he doesn't have another way to access it since he doesn't use computers. It took alot of coaching to teach him the bluray player. So, my mom has been trying to get a new bluray player or just something that he can stream Netflix on. I suggested getting a fire stick or a roku stick because getting a cheap older bluray and one of the sticks is cheaper than a streaming bluray player. 

On my birthday she came home after work with a very nice and thoughtful card and a roku stick. A roku stick that is not really for me since I can stream stuff from my computer and will not be going with me when I move out. I know that she didn't get it because she thought I wanted it, but because she  knew the house needed it and was just making the excuse that it's my birthday to ""give it to me"". I was confused when she first gave it to me so I asked ""this is my birthday present right?"" with probably not the most excited tone but I was surprised. She confirmed that and she could tell that I wasn't super happy and excited so she looked defeated and said she would get me a different present if I wanted and I quickly said that wasn't necessary and thanked her for the gift. But, I'm still upset a bit, it makes me feel so unappreciated that she didn't even get me something that I wanted for my birthday. 

So, WIBTA if I asked for a different birthday present after getting one that wasn't for me but to just make my dad happy? 

I might like to add that all the subscriptions that are streamed, I pay for and just let my parents use my account because they want to and I live in their house so I try to contribute in any way that I can. I also know this isn't a financial issue, my parents are not having any money problems to not be able to afford both a computer chair and a streaming stick.",False,False,2020-07-15 01:41:41

I am a 21 y/o female and my wife is 23. We just purchased our first home and moved in about a week ago. Our kitchen window has no curtains or blinds, nor does it have any fixture to which one could attach a window covering to. That window overlooks our backyard and, if they wanted to, our neighbors could hypothetically look in to our window. So, our home has no air conditioning and we are in somewhat of a heat wave for my region. It's hot as balls and our pedestal fans just are not cutting it, so when I'm walking around and unpacking boxes, washing dishes, just... doing anything even remotely physical, I prefer to do so au naturel. That is to say, I like walking around naked in the heat. Before this, we lived in my parents' air conditioned home so I didn't really walk about nude, but since moving in it's become a bit of a point of contention with my wife and I. 

The neighbors do have children, and like I said the children could hypothetically look into the window if they so desired. My thought is, it's my damn house and if they don't want to see anything, they shouldn't look into other people's windows. My wife says that I shouldn't (just because of the neighbors, she likes seeing me naked lol), and my mother has even said that doing so would be abusive to the neighbors' children??? Honestly, I don't get the issue. So, Reddit, AITA?

Edit for clarification: When I say the window has no fixture I literally mean when we moved in, there was no curtain rod or fixture for blinds. I didn't mean to say there was no way to install one. I'm not opposed to getting curtains at all, we just haven't as of yet as there are more important things we need to spend our money on. Let me also note that I'm not constantly standing in front of that particular window, but occasionally walking past it whilst doing other things.",False,1594707307.0,2020-07-14 06:41:49

Sally, Patty, and Bill are pressuring Bob to sell half the boat to Bill but Bob doesn't want to since it his boat.

930,AITA for yelling at my stepfather when he asked my daughter to stay over?,18,Not the A-hole,47,hqoyeh,1594706882.0,"First time posting, and it‚Äôs not a crazy interesting one. But, I‚Äôm still burning up mad, so I need to know if I‚Äôm the AH here. 

My (40F) daughter is a little over a year old. She loves her grandparents, my mom and step-father (both 60). They‚Äôve been together for 16 years, and started dating when I was an adult, so he‚Äôs not really a father figure to me, per se. 

We have a mostly good relationship, although I feel like he does things just to get a rise out of me. For instance, I believe that ketchup doesn‚Äôt belong on eggs. Disagree with me all you want, I think it‚Äôs gross and I don‚Äôt want to feed it to my kid. My stepfather not only taught her to request ketchup with her eggs, but he reminds her every time he knows she‚Äôs having eggs for breakfast. It burns me up and he knows it!

Anyway, on to the question. We were at mom‚Äôs house today and happened to be leaving when my step-father got home from work. He usually stays later, so I had no idea he was coming back early. He‚Äôs playing with my daughter and says, ‚ÄúDo you want to stay?‚Äù and I lost it! I yelled ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt offer her something I‚Äôm not willing to give!‚Äù This is something I‚Äôve told him many, many times in the past. 

I guess my quick change to yelling caught them off-guard because my mother told me not to yell, and that he was only asking because he‚Äôs off tomorrow. I said ‚ÄúSo what? So is my husband and we have plans.‚Äù So, she called me nasty, he called me nasty and I left in a huff. And, when I called to have my daughter say goodnight, mom was cold toward me and rushed off the phone. 

Here‚Äôs the thing: my daughter might forget a promise now but when she‚Äôs a little bit older, that promise to stay at grandma/grandpa‚Äôs house becomes one that I am then forced to break because no one consulted me on it. I think it undermines the parental relationship and makes me look like the bad guy.

So I called him out on it, stating that he was sexualizing a platonic relationship, it was a shitty thing to do and I used his real name.

Not his full name but just his first one. 

Apparently one of his friends saw and reported it to the teacher in charge of QSA.

Through a lot of digging it turns out he has a bit of a history of writing tweets often centered around white supremacy, and him being generally homophobic. (Which came off as a surprise cuz I‚Äôm gay lol)

My brother has been to multiple pride parades, as an ally, and to help his friends in the lgbtq+ community. 

It wasn‚Äôt as funny as he may have thought it was because the teacher kicked him out, and his friends shunned him.

Now he‚Äôs pissed at me, I feel like I should apologize but I also feel like I‚Äôm in the right. My siblings say I should have talked to him in private, or called him.

My husband (27m) is currently a medical resident working 80+ hours a week and I am an ESL teacher. 

I want to hire a bilingual nanny (specifically one who speaks Spanish) because my husband‚Äôs parents are from Mexico and a lot of his family still lives there and only speaks Spanish. I have been working on my Spanish for many years because I really want to connect with his side of the family as I consider them my family too now that we‚Äôre married. I don‚Äôt want my daughter (or any other children we may have) to feel disconnected from half her family so I thought hiring a bilingual nanny would be a good way to help her learn Spanish. While I could teach her some vocabulary I‚Äôm no where fluent enough to immerse her in the language and my husband is at work for 12+ hours a day, 6 days a week so I figured the nanny would be the one spending more time with her when she‚Äôs younger and learning languages. My husband will eventually have way less hours once he finishes residency but that‚Äôs several years away and younger children pick up languages more easily. 

Here‚Äôs the issue: my husband is totally supportive of my nanny plan but when it was mentioned to my MIL she was very angry and offended. I thought she‚Äôd be happy about her grandchild learning Spanish but instead she was upset that I (a white woman) wanted to hire a Hispanic nanny because it perpetuated the stereotypes that Hispanics were uneducated and were only house keepers. I tried explaining it wasn‚Äôt about race but language acquisition (something I‚Äôve studied a lot for my career) and technically she could be any race as long as she spoke fluent Spanish (obviously I realize she‚Äôd most likely be Hispanic). 

So now I don‚Äôt know what to do because I was thinking that my children being bilingual was really important but I don‚Äôt want to offend my in laws and I feel like anything I say in favor of my plan just gets twisted into something I didn‚Äôt intend. I realize as a white woman I may never be able to fully understand this issue so I thought asking for an outside opinion would be best.

Me (22M) and my boyfriend (21M) are currently heading into our senior year of undergrad. We have been together for almost a year and have been talking about getting engaged in the spring if we decide to make the big move to graduate school together.

As I love my SO, I have spent a large amount of time in the last few months researching grad schools that are in areas where I can attend a funded PHD program, in an area that is LGBTQ friendly and has a school with a MSW program for him. We have also had to worry about acceptances as my SO has a GPA that is just below a 3.0 (will be there by graduation) and due to testing anxiety has not scored too well on preliminary GRE exams. While my application as a whole is likely to be competitive I too struggle on standardized tests and have been scoring just around the 50th percentile on preliminary exams. In order to make the cutoff for the Phd programs in my field I will likely need to be above 50th percentile. If I can clear this bar and programs find me a good fit, I should get into hopefully 3-5 of the 10 programs I apply to (Acceptance rate in my field is between 10-40%). Me and my SO have had long conversations about graduate school and have narrowed our list down to 10 prospective schools/areas. We both have expressed our love for each other so much over the last 6 months we have lived together during Covid. We both would like to move together, get married and start a life together but are still thinking about the prospect knowing that we would like to continue our education.

This summer has been stressful for both of us as we both lost our research internships and he is still out of a job. I on the other hand work 9-4, 4 days a week. I can study some at my job but normally I have to prioritize my studies during other free periods. My SO studies while I am at work has increasingly become frustrated that I study during our free time.He expresses that he feels like we aren't even a couple anymore as we ""hardly ever"" do things together anymore (we are going on a week long trip to Seattle in a month) and that he feels like more of my roommate. He keeps telling me that I need to lay off the studies for sometime and just relax (I do, I just need to study for a few hours everyday) to spend some time with him. He often states that is unfair for me to use the time we both are off to study as he has to spend 28 hours home alone while I work and wants to spend time with me when he can. Today we had a long conversation that got heated as he is very frustrated with me spending so much of my time worrying about grad school and the GRE and that I should just give it a rest. I explained that I am working so hard and prioritizing our future so that we can have a future without conflicts which he responded with ""We won't have a future together if you can't prioritize this relationship in the now"".

Literally all night, Paul was demanding my boyfriend basically work as his personal DJ, asking him to turn it up/turn it down/change the song/etc. (It was on an iPad, on Spotify. Not rocket science to do it yourself.) I didn‚Äôt notice, until he started snapping his fingers at my boyfriend and saying ‚ÄòOi. Volume up.‚Äô, which I thought was ridiculously rude and could see how uncomfortable my boyfriend was. He offered to make a playlist, not DJ all night and was here to enjoy himself. 

I (while sat at the opposite end of the garden to Paul) told him that my boyfriend wasn‚Äôt his personal DJ, to which Paul replied ‚Äòsure he is‚Äô.

I (14M) have two dogs, one of them is an Australian Shepard ‚ÄúBowie‚Äù (2 1/2 M) and miniature schnauzer ‚ÄúCleo‚Äù(14 F).  Back in 2002-2011) my family had 4 dogs, Cleo was the fourth and final during that time period (2006). The reason for her to come home was because my mom had a shop and she wanted a dog to be with her at a store. My dad never approved of Cleo since they were raising 4 children (including me as a toddler) plus 3 dogs, so they were technically raising 7 children and my dad doesn‚Äôt need a 8th. My dad is a police man and used to be a k-9, the third dog was a Belgian malinois (police dog) and all of them were crazy as hell. From dad‚Äôs experience, Cleo is a bitch. She would bark at almost anyone that comes to the house, she would tear up my baby stuff animals, my mom would have her lay in bed with her which really annoyed my dad. The only thing my dad liked about her was that she‚Äôs energetic enough to go on a jog which is what tires her. My mom didn‚Äôt give a fuck about her behavior. From what my dad says, my mom has a bad habit of getting a dog, taking care of it for like less then a month, then just stops and my older siblings, dad, and my grandma would take care of the dog (it still goes on to this day). 

For the past year and half, Cleo has some skin issues, she would constantly bite herself that the majority of her fur is gone. She has dried skin flanks hanging off her fur and smells like piss. My grandma gives her a bath every Wednesday, but nothing really changes. She‚Äôs been checked out to the vet and they gave her some meds. They kinda worked. Earlier today, I spot Cleo in her dog cave while putting Bowie‚Äôs leash on to take him for a walk. I assume she was sleeping since she‚Äôs my age (human years) and really really loves her sleep. I came back 30 minutes after the walk and she‚Äôs still there. My mom gets home from work and let‚Äôs the dogs in, Cleo wouldn‚Äôt come out. So she went and got her but noticed she isn‚Äôt moving at all. She immediately rushed to the nearest vet that was open. I came downstairs (I was taking a shower during this time) to the living room where everyone (my grandma, and stepdad) had this look of worry, they told me what happened and I explain that she‚Äôd been like that since I walked Bentley. My grandma had this now pissed off look and my stepdad noticed it. He told me not to worry, that I thought she was sleeping. My mom comes back without her in tears. We all started to tear up, they told mom when I saw Cleo and she yelled at me in tears. She said that I‚Äôm responsible for her death, that if I let grandma or stepdad know then she‚Äôd be alive. Grandma agreed with her while stepdad had my back. I just left to my room while they were arguing with each other. I don‚Äôt know what to do right now.

940,AITA for making my injured sister so upset she wants to leave?,17,No A-holes here,25,hph35k,1594528101.0,"Usually a lurker only, so forgive any mistakes. People are me (30F) and sister Sarah (34F). Fake names, obviously. 

For background, my sister Sarah is a difficult, demanding person. She can also be wonderful when she‚Äôs in a good mood. The problem is you never know how she‚Äôll react and it‚Äôs caused a lot of issues in our relationship. 

Because we could both work at home during COVID, we went to stay with our parents and sister, Jen (24). After months of increased conflict, all of us were at our breaking point so Sarah decided to go home. Then she broke her ankle and severely sprained the other one. Sarah‚Äôs recovering at our parents house and is completely stuck in bed. This means we‚Äôre doing literally everything for her despite the fact we‚Äôre all working. Our days are just work, help Sarah, and try to sleep. It‚Äôs been nearly two weeks and we‚Äôre all exhausted. 

This would be difficult at any time; throw in COVID, us already being fed up with each other, and Sarah‚Äôs demanding ways, and it‚Äôs near impossible. To make everything worse, Sarah constantly complains that we haven‚Äôt done things right. It‚Äôs truly awful to be so exhausted you can barely see straight and then be berated because the towel you got isn‚Äôt soft enough. 

From her perspective, she‚Äôs a person who needs to be in control and is now dependent on other people for everything. She‚Äôs in a lot of pain and is trying to make herself more comfortable in whatever way she can. I understand that the pain/meds/anxiety are affecting her behaviour. I also don‚Äôt react well to confrontation with her; I bottle up the little frustrations and blow up over something seemingly inconsequential. 

Today started off terribly. She was already in a bad mood, very rude and snappy. Our dad came to ask me something and I said ‚Äúher‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù. She lost it. Said it was demeaning for us to talk like she wasn‚Äôt there, I told her it was hard to monitor my language that thoroughly when I‚Äôm this tired. It went on and on. I ended up in tears asking her to just be a bit nicer while she yelled at me that I was telling her she wasn‚Äôt allowed to feel. 

Afterwards, she sent a text to our family chat saying she didn‚Äôt want to be a burden anymore and to find her a rehabilitation centre she could recover in. 

As a result, Sarah and I had a 2-hour fight where said I needed her to be a bit more flexible with us in terms of when exactly we could do things. If that made her stressed, impeding her recovery, then I could help her find a home. She responded that being flexible is impossible and my request was unacceptable. 

So, AITA? On one hand, I feel like the text was some truly fucked up emotional blackmail in response to a pretty minor request to be nicer. On the other hand, I‚Äôm worried my exhaustion and tendency to bottle things up led to a confrontation that could‚Äôve been avoided and my sister is in a difficult position with zero control and reacting poorly.",False,False,2020-07-11 21:28:21

She was upset about the job, and during lockdown me and her got into it and I admitted to her that I sometimes look at pictures of us when she was 21 and cry.

946,AITA for reversing a prank on the prankster?,14,Asshole,34,howmtl,1594442040.0,"[Throwaway because I‚Äôm a somewhat well-known content creator]

A few months ago I had a minor crush on a close friend of mine (we‚Äôll call her Peggy). She was comfortable with it and all of our friends not-so-secretly shipped us. Anyway, she got a boyfriend (we‚Äôll call him Griff) that no one likes and he refused to let her hang out with me. He threw a childish hissy fit about my daily compliment texts (that I had been sending her for years and were very much a harmless friend thing at this point) because he was so insecure.

I wanted to get back at him, but he‚Äôs very immature and I took the high road instead. However, Griff was known for being a bit of a prankster (particularly using laxatives and his baking talents), so naturally when he invited me to make peace with him and Peggy over cupcakes, I was on high alert. Then when I arrived, it turned out that ‚Äúsomething unexpected came up‚Äù and I‚Äôd have to turn around and leave. Thankfully, they had already baked the cupcakes and sent me home with one.

Obviously I didn‚Äôt fall for it and found tiny pieces of those laxatives shaped like soda bottles. Then the evil genius part of my brain had an idea. What if I pretended to have a serious allergic reaction to the cake? The setup was simple: I found a YouTube video with ambient hospital sounds and called Peggy (I didn‚Äôt have Griff‚Äôs number but figured they were both still at his place).

As soon I said I was in the ICU she started freaking out. She asked if I had hurt myself (???) and I said it was my intestines. I told her they found some chemical and I asked her what was in the cake. She started crying and I had her to put Griff on the phone.

I told him I was in the hospital because of his cake and he got all defensive and I pushed him to admit it but he denied everything. I said I was recording the call and that I had a lawyer ready so he better be careful. I can see how this might be too far, but if you met Griff you‚Äôd understand. I told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you in court‚Äù and heaved as I hung up. Bear in mind that I‚Äôm an acting major.

Peggy texted me for updates but I ignored her to put a little fear of God in Griff. I fished the cake out of the trash, put it in a box I labelled ‚ÄúNext time don‚Äôt fuck with the wrong guy, Griff‚Äù, and left it at his door later that afternoon. I guess he got the message because Peggy texted me a big paragraph saying she was ‚Äúreconsidering our friendship‚Äù. I told her she should ‚Äúreconsider her boyfriend.‚Äù

I decided to let them cool off for a while as quarantine settled in. I texted Peggy out of the blue today to catch up and she‚Äôs still upset after all this time. I told my viewers this story while streaming and they claimed I took it a little too far.

So with all that, AITA?

947,AITA for freaking out my bipolar friend and making him think he was having a manic episode?,20,Asshole,42,hovktr,1594438564.0,"My best friend (22M) is bipolar. He's very open about it, makes jokes about it, and it isn't an off-limits topic when we're roasting and joking with him.

When he's about to have a particularly scary manic episode, he hallucinates a man wearing a suit and horse mask like [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/2ntVgyUeEWKJzRfH6) 

It's quite a funny image, but apparently it's what he sees before he goes into hours/ days of manic hallucinations (which happen every few months). He jokes about it often, but it was obviously a scary sight to him. He sees it looking through glass panels in doors, at the foot of his bed, etc. 

Earlier today, I (22M) was in the supermarket and saw a mask very similar to the ones he'd described hallucinating, and I considered sebding him a photo like ""look what I just saw"" (he would definitely have been cool with that). However, I thought again, and I purchased it (it was cheap).

When I got home, I put on my suit jacket, put the horse mask in my car, and drove the 5 minutes to my friends house, where he lives with his dad and girlfriend. I put on the mask, and popped up at their window. He and his girlfriend were sat watching TV. I expected him to freak out for a second, and then I'd pull the mask off. Then maybe have some socially distanced drinks through the window. Harmless prank, I thought. 

So he sees me, freaks out for a second, asks his girlfriend if she can see me too (expecting her to say no), and she looks scared and says she can. He starts FREAKING OUT big time. He thinks she's part of his manic episode. I pull the mask off, expecting him to calm down, but I can only describe his expression as one of absolute terror when he actually saw my face. He apparently thought he was hallucinating me too. 

Long story short, it took us about 15 minutes to convince him it was only a prank and he wasn't hallucinating or paranoid.

When he accepted that I was really me, and that his girlfriend could really see me too, he was incredibly angry and upset (as was his girlfriend) that I'd ""tried to induce a manic episode"". 

That wasn't my intention. I intended for him to jump, be scared for a moment, and then laugh as I took the mask off. 

They asked me to leave and said what I did was ""fucked up"" and that I was a terrible friend. I disagree. I wouldn't have done what I did if I had anticipated his reaction, and while I'm sorry it happened, I don't think I should be accused of trying to induce a manic episode when I was actually trying to pull a prank.

Returning home from a camping weekend we had two vehicles, and 6 people plus loads of gear across two cars (3 people each). We had about a half an hour head start on vehicle #2 and were about an hour away from home.

We started getting texts stating vehicle #2 had car trouble and had to pull over. They said they needed a jump but that a good samaritan had stopped with cables. At the moment it seemed under control so we kept driving. Soon though, word came back the car died again. It wasn‚Äôt the battery but likely the alternator. We were close to a rest stop so we decided to pull over and assess.

The two people in my vehicle, almost immediately started explaining that the only option was to drive to the other car and pickup all 3 people for the rest of the journey putting 6 total in our car, a 2008 Prius. I pushed back and said this wasn‚Äôt the best option. My alternative plans were A) call a relative who lived about 35 minutes away to see if they could assist by either picking up some people or actually lending us a car (they would drive w/ their spouse in their two cars). B) Split the cost of an uber between the six of us (est. was $80) to get the other people home.

These ideas were emphatically denied; without debate and it was implied I was acting rude for not being on board on driving with everyone in our vehicle. We were on a major highway and with about 65 minutes left to our destination.

The argument against my suggestions was that we would be rude asking for help from the relative; and that the cost of the uber was too much (even split 6 ways). 

Fortunately, a Tow Truck Driver offered to not only take the car to the city we were headed but had room for two people. We circled back and picked up 1 more person and safely drove home with 4.

953,"AITA for not honouring a conversation I had with my friend 3 years ago, saying I would make him the best man at my wedding?",16,Not the A-hole,22,hodqck,1594365547.0,"I (26M) have had this friend (Daniel) since I was 6 years-old. We have been part of the same circle of friends since this age and there are 5 of us in total (Me, Anthony, Benjamin, Clayton and Daniel).

I told Daniel 3 years ago that if I were to ever get married, he would be my best man. But since then, I have grown a lot closer to our other friends and now would say I love them all equally.

Since 3 years ago, Daniel has become quite a toxic person. Nothing is ever his fault in his eyes and he ALWAYS blames others for the things that go wrong in his life. Despite this, we still try to be supportive friends to him.

I recently got engaged to my partner Ellie (28F) and when we announced our engagement; our friends came round to celebrate. Except Daniel, who didn't come because he said he was cooking dinner.

I was fine with Daniel not coming round, it was late in the evening and was also short notice.

When my other friends were round, we spoke about wedding plans because we were obviously excited. We discussed the stag do and then the topic of best man came up.

I said to them 'best man' seemed quite high-school-playground-esque to me now e.g. ""i love you all but YOU'RE my FAVOURITE friend"". It felt unfair to pick one person when all 4 of them have always been there for me.

I told them that I would love each of them to play a role in the wedding.

Anthony to do the speech, Benjamin to do the stag do, Clayton to be one ring bearer and help pick suits; Daniel to be the other ring bearer and wait with me at the alter on the big day, to calm my nerves. I am happy with my choices on who will do what role, as I have picked what I feel is each friend's best quality (public speaking, party animal, stylish, loyalty). 

I know it feels very ""participation award"" but that's what would make me happy and felt the fairest thing to do, considering I would not want to leave anyone out.

I said to Anthony, Benjamin and Clayton that I would ask them all again more formally in a few weeks time over a meal. I figured I could tell Daniel about it then as well face to face, rather than over the phone.

Since then, Daniel has spoken to Benjamin and Clayton behind my back saying he is pissed off because I haven't asked him to be in the wedding party yet and was EXPECTING to be best man. Ellie and I have only been engaged for a week...

Daniel also said to Benjamin that I ""promised"" 3 years ago if I ever get married, he would be the best man. Although I DO remember this conversation, I was also very intoxicated. Apparently Daniel has already written some of the best-man speech because of this conversation we had.

I feel bad about this, but at the same time he IS still technically being a ""best man"" of sorts, just alongside 3 other people?

Benjamin told me that Daniel wants to be best man by himself because that is what I apparently agreed 3 years ago. Benjamin said he understands if I ask him to step down from his role.

They were both incredibly accepting, which I'm super lucky and grateful for. I requested that they call me James instead of my old name, and they both readily agreed.

Later, my mother texted me and asked me if I was sure that this was the name I would settle on, if I was planning on getting it legally changed, stuff like that. I told her that I thought that this is what I would settle for, as this is the name I've been thinking of since I discovered that I was trans, but I won't be able to tell for sure until I live with it for a while. She brought up the idea of another name, a Gaelic name which was what her grandfather was called and what she was originally planning on naming me if I were born a boy. I think that it sounds nice, but I wouldn't like it to be my name, and so I was pretty dismissive of it. It's pretty uncommon, so I'm going to avoid saying the name here just to keep as anonymous as possible.

Lately though she's become more set on this name. She's been insisting on it a lot, and she's begun to call me it instead of James. I've had to tell her outright now that I don't want to be called this name. Part of why I chose James is that it's pretty clearly masculine, and I'm currently very androgynous looking, so if someone can't tell then they'd hopefully assume that I'm a dude from my name. The Gaelic name is only used for guys to my knowledge, but the average person where I'm from probably hasn't heard it before and so it wouldn't immediately come across as masculine to them. 

I explained this to her, but she pretty got defensive about it, saying how if she had a son she wanted to honour her grandfather with the name, and said that each parent gets to name their child and that I'm stealing that away from her. I understand where she's coming from, that most people's names are the ones that their parents chose from them and that each parent expects their kid to live with the name they chose out, and I really am sorry that the name she gave me at birth which also meant a lot to her was just thrown out like that, but I feel like I'm old enough to choose my own name that I'm comfortable with, and that there's no point to changing my name to something that I'll hate.

I honestly told him, no, I didn't like that picture. He seemed taken aback and asked me why. I told him that it is just a really bad picture of him and doesn't even resemble what he looks like. 

He then got angry and told me that ""as my girlfriend, you should always think I look good"".

They‚Äôve always been a little uptight and prickly, but their husbands (my uncles) are some of my favorite people ever - they‚Äôre kind, caring, funny, and have always been there for me, my siblings, and my cousins no matter what.

5 years ago, my Aunt J and Uncle L were going through a rough patch. He wanted to go to counseling to work it out, which she took as an insult and outright refused. After months of not being able to get through to her, Uncle L moved out until she was willing to work through things.

My husband and I also got married 5 years ago. We had set the date before Aunt J and Uncle L had their falling-out. When it came time for RSVPs, Uncle L messaged to let me know that he hated to miss it but he didn‚Äôt want to cause unnecessary tension at our wedding. I was upset because I wanted him there, but I understood - my aunts were furious and it would‚Äôve been really uncomfortable for him.

I believed him. A few days ago, we had a conversation about trust and he said he never lied to me. Unfortunately that did not end up being the case. During our skype call this evening, I noticed him turn to the side when I wasn't looking and smoke just so happened to come out of his mouth. I asked him about it and he said it was just ""dust."" 5 minutes later, he confessed to vaping occasionally throughout the day. He said he wasn't planning on telling me because he was in the process of ""quitting"" anyway. He was afraid of telling me because he knew how against it I was. He also reassured me that he doesn't smoke anything else or do any drugs. Unfortunately the way he responded to me when I asked about him smoking weed says otherwise. This is an example:

Me: Do you smoke weed?

Him: No, but would you break up with me if I did?

Me: Depends. The main reason I'd break up was because you lied to me from the start. But if you smoked weed occasionally for health reasons or socially/responsibly and I knew about it, then I probably wouldn't.

Him: Well, rest assured, I don't smoke weed. I have in the past, but that was many years ago and I don't plan on doing it again

Me: Then why did you ask me if I'd break up with you if I did?

Him: So.. you would break up with me? I thought you cared enough about me to look past something like that.

So, when we had our father's day barbeque, I made myself an omelette and some veggies. I sat outside with them and ate, and pariticpated in the barbeque in everything but the food.

We're having a Barbeque again today, and I'm planning on making an omelette again - but all three members of my family think I'm being unreasonable, and that it's ""not a big ask"" for me to eat the barbeque food that I dislike. I feel like I am participating, though, because I'm with them in everything but the type of food - and I'm not forcing them to make me the alternative, I'm making it myself. This seems like a silly, small issue, but having three people making snarky comments about it is getting to me.

972,AITA for calling my timeshares security on my suite neighbor for smoking pot?,15,Not the A-hole,44,hp57r9,1594476993.0,"So I'm on vacation in Virginia and my family has a timeshare. Those unfamiliar, you basically pay for vacation stay in advance through maintenance fees and such. Then come to stay for a specific week each year.

Anyway, earlier tonight me and my girlfriend and I were in the living room of the suite and I started to smell something skunky. 

I asked her ""is that weed?"" And she said ""I don't think so, I don't smell anything.""

A little while later it becomes stronger. Then MUCH stronger. She can smell it too. (Our unit actually still smells like it)

I open my front door and get a blast of the smell. Its coming from the neighbors unit and it is STRONG. 

So I call the front desk and they transferred me to security. A little while later I hear their door open and close a whole bunch. I look outside and see them leaving. Luggage and all. 

Weird thing is that this is a two bedroom unit. 1 king and 2 twin beds total. There were EIGHT people leaving. 

4 small kids, 3 adults, and a teenager. 

I felt bad at that moment. 

On one hand, I might have just ruined their family vacation. 

On the other hand, I pay a lot of money every year to stay here. And don't think I should have to make due with my room getting stinky because theyre smoking inside.

My two friends, Amber and Ahmad (M&F20s) asked me if I wanted to live with them in university. We found a 3-bedroom place and signed a January to December lease. We decided who‚Äôs room was whose and what room was what and some basic house rules, one of them being that the downstairs common areas to be homework free unless working on group assignments with others. Right before we moved in Amber and Ahmad started dating and decided to share a bedroom to sleep in and use what would have been his bedroom as an office for only them to do their homework.

Fast forward to us living there and their office is no longer an office, they use the room as their storage room. In Jan and Feb things were fine, A & A would move upstairs if they were studying at the dining room table and I was eating or about to eat. By March, they decided that they were no longer going to ‚Äúaccommodate‚Äù me and will continue studying in the dining room. They expect complete silence downstairs (tell me to turn off music/get off the phone while cooking/no friends over), and would make no space for me to eat at the table (table covered with papers and laptops and cord and textbooks). I reminded them that this was not the agreement when we originally agreed to live together and told them they needed to use their study room, not the dining room.

ONE WEEK LATER Dining table was pushed against the wall making half of it unusable, their printer, white board, and one computer desk + chair were added to the dining room. After this they referred to the dining room as the office.

I told them they needed to change it back and find a solution to their study space problem. They yelled at me saying exams were coming and I don‚Äôt get to tell them what to do. I told them they‚Äôve been telling me what to do for two months (turn off your music, telling my boyfriend I wasn‚Äôt home so he would leave, making the entire downstairs unwelcoming, not letting me use the dining room to eat, etc.).

The argument escalated and they offered me out of the lease and March‚Äôs rent back if I moved out by the end of the weekend (36hours). I borrowed a friend‚Äôs van, found a new place to live (cost less than living with them), got a bunch of friends to help me and I was gone by Sunday at 7pm. 

Amber and Ahmad couldn‚Äôt find someone to live with them until September and they were on the hook for an extra $600/month for 5 months plus the March rent they gave back to me. A year later Ahmad told me that they didn‚Äôt think I could do it which was why they offered it.

Edit: it's my niece not my nephew 


Ok so first things first no this isn't fake although I wish it was, two yes this is a throwaway since my business is linked to my personal reddit. 

So when I was 12 I overheard a conversation between my mother and my grandmother and that was the fact that my mom was married to her second cousin, who you guessed it is my father. Supposedly it wasn't until they were deeply in love and engaged that they had discovered the fact that they shared the same great grandparents. Both families had buried the truth and threatened those who knew to keep quiet. 
I never told a soul not even my siblings, and my parents had no idea I knew. 

Cue last weekend and my family got together post Covid for my nieces baptism brunch (she was baptized before Covid). I have a ok relationship with my sister the baby's mother and a close relationship with our brother. None of us have close relationships to our parents, both have narcissistic tendencies and my mother is a closet alcoholic. 

My mother was three mimosas in and started picking on my younger brother and I (he's 22,I'm 25 and my sister is 27) saying we'd never get married because who could put up with us, among other things. I was a bit tipsy myself so I blurted out at least I won't need to marry my cousin. Needless to say the party was pretty much over. My parents are saying they are cutting me off, no big loss there. My sister was angry I didn't tell her when I found out but she's gotten over it, and my brother laughed so hard he cried. 

However my grandparents and my moms sister are blowing up my phone telling me I suck and I'm a horrible son. So am I the asshole?

Okay, I'm non-binary and pansexual, the only pronouns that i use are 'they'/'them' I'm fine with people doing it by mistake, or seeing me for the first time and calling me 'she'. I felt lonely, so I joined an LGBT chat.

Anyway, One of the rules of this chat is; 'Do not argue about someones gender pro-nouns, only you know who you are, respect that.'

I thought: *'this is the place I've been looking for!'*

I joined and for a few months it was cool and I made friends with these people \[not real names\] specifically; *Sander, Marylin, Lunar, Serenity and DabbieDog*

It was all cool until I asked them on the open chat to refer to me as 'they' it was all well and fine, then Marylin who is a lesbian said she was uncomfortable with calling me 'they'.

On an LGBTQ+ chat.

I politely told her, that it was who I was, and she kept trying to tell me that she didn't want to call me that, and that I couldn't 'force her' and that she felt 'uncomfortable' calling me 'they'

I got pissed, this happens all the time in real life with people I meet, I let it go because I can't control everyone's tolerance, but it made me so hurt that I was on a 'LGBT+' chat and that someone could say something like that on a chat that literally says in the rules not to argue about peoples pronouns.

She then said and I quote: 'choose another pronoun'

This chat has open history so anyone and everyone all 100 members can see what people say, and obviously everyone joined my side saying that this is an LGBT+ chat and that she has to respect that I am non-binary.

I blew up and said she was a bitch and an ass-hole, I had people say they were 'uncomfortable' about my pronouns before and It hurt so bad, so I joined a chat, for people like me, thinking that no-one would ever say something like this on an LGBT+ chat, how much more my *friend* Marylin.

She messaged Serenity saying i had 'turned everyone against her' and that i was 'bullying her ' and she messaged serenity that 'BeechImGay is a massive bully and I will never talk to her again..'

And she's been offline for 1 hour now and I don't know what to do, I tried telling her that I am who I am, but she kept on saying 'choose another one' or 'let's compromise' It made me mad that someone on an LGBT+ chat would say something like that.

977,"AITA for not being more supportive of BF's ""health problems""?",15,Not the A-hole,50,hov894,1594437465.0,"I (23F) have been living with my boyfriend (25M) for about three years now. About two months ago, he started showing real hypochondriac tendencies and self-diagnosing himself with a couple dozen medical conditions. I was concerned for him until repeated doctors appointments showed nothing wrong with him, and were big wastes of time/money (and dangerous, when hospitals are COVID hot spots). They kept telling him what I was telling him - he was stressed out, get more sleep, exercise, etc. It makes sense to be health stressed with everything going on but he's been tested for COVID at least 4 times now, always negative. When it became worrying he might have other diseases/conditions the visits to the doc's started really adding up and we do not have insurance.

He's always trawling WebMD trying to diagnose his ""symptoms"" but when he goes to the Dr.'s it's always the same story, they give him a sedative/tell him to drink more water/work out. (To be clear, he's not in intolerable pain, but various states of discomfort, like elevated heart rate/lack of sleep/tummy upset. I'm sure it sucks, but the sheer panic about it and the resulting snowballing effect is the worse issue). I want to help him address his stress levels and get him in a better place mentally, but he doesn't really want to do yoga/meditate with me when I offered to start doing it as a couples thing, and hates when I suggest stuff like cutting down on caffeine. I've tried a ton of things. I used to think he just wanted there to be an easy answer he could take a pill for and fix, but when the next condition he diagnosed himself with was lactose intolerance (he has never had any digestive issues related to dairy before this), he refused to drink the almond milk or take the lactaid I bought him whenever I cooked a dairy-based meal. He said he didn't want to become ""dependent on drugs"" and only eats things like ramen and resents when I cook dinners he ""can't eat"".

I will be honest, I feel pretty resentful of how much money I've spent on this wild goosechase and how unwilling he is to try solutions that aren't just throwing money at a doctor, and his position is incomprehensible to me (what is he going to do if there really IS something wrong and a doc prescribes him a drug? Not take it because he would be ""dependent"" on medication?) so I told him to fend for himself when it comes to special arrangements for the good of his health. He got furious with me and told me that I ""didn't care if he lived or died"" and that I was ""basically killing him"", which was so silly I laughed in his face (I know this was very rude and horrible, for sure AITA for laughing, but that's not what I am asking). Now we're not talking and I hate it.

If he was in pain or the doctor actually told him something was actually actually wrong I would never ever dismiss it. But it's all so mild and symptomatic of stress that I don't get why he won't consider that as the issue?

AITA for not being more supportive?

We've long gotten over it, and we're just curious. 100% honest. We're writing this post together.

I (27F) got into a minor car crash while my boyfriend (28M) was in the car with me. We were turning right at a stop sign, but my view was obstructed by the cars parked on the side of the road and I didn't see the car coming. It scraped my side of the car. The other car was probably going under 30mph. I was going maybe like 5 mph.The damage to both cars was minor, and nobody was hurt.

After we and the other party exchanged insurance information, we got back into the car continued on our way to dinner. I noticed my boyfriend was quiet and sulking, and asked him what was wrong. He explained that while it was fortunate that the damage was minor and nobody was hurt, I should have asked if he was okay. He also pointed out that it was my negligence that caused the crash, and that I should have apologized to him. (Aside: he feels that I can be careless while driving, and maintains that the driver of the vehicle is responsible for the safety of the passengers.)

I answered that since the collision was on my side and that neither of us were going very fast, that it was self-evident that he wasn't hurt, and that there was no reason for me to ask if he was okay and to apologize (to my boyfriend specifically, because I did apologize and take fault for the crash to the other driver).

In addition, I was flustered because it was the first time I have ever been in an accident, and I didn't think at the time to even ask. My boyfriend acknowledges that he could have been more delicate considering the circumstances, but maintains that his core point holds true. To be clear, he did not yell, but he was obviously mad.

I still believe I don't need to apologize to him. AITA?

For the most part the teacher has been pretty kind overall, and I will freely admit that I am not the best at managing my time, and so left alot of work till late.
One of the final assignments that I did not give myself enough time for was a 3 page paper, the instructions of which were to write a paper about advice to parents of young children based on language or cognitive development. I decided to write my paper on a how different parenting styles can have an impact attachment theory in terms if infants. In retrospect I understand that this is not exactly what the instructions were asking for, but in my defense the instructions to this paper were vague at best.
The teacher responded to this with a note saying that I had not followed the instructions but it was a good paper, and then gave a grade of 25/75. Since it had put in alot of work I decided to email the teacher, apologizing for not following the instructions and asking for an opportunity to rewrite the paper in order to get a better final grade. I also included 2 main arguments about why my paper could be considered under the umbrella of cognitive development, which was that there is a significant amount of overlap between the disciplines of psychology, and that theories had aspects of other thing in it besides for jsut thr category that it falls under, and that this applies for attachment theory as well. I also argued that since this paper was on advising the parents to actively modify their behavior in order to give their children better skills to succeed in later in life, and that this could fall under cognitive development. I made it clear that I was not trying to change the teachers mind, only defending my disposition, and that I understood it was ultimately their decisions on what grade to give me.

This was the response I got back:

your argument is ill founded.  You don't get a re-do.  I had considered a grade of 0, which would have meant you failed the course.

Just yesterday, her mother said she is doing elective surgery and would like my wife to come out ahead of time to take care of her. Wife said she would have to ask her work. her mother decided that she was in charge and that she would like her there for 3 days instead and it would be in the middle of our vacation and she would only miss out on a day of work rather than a whole week and wont take no for an answer.

Wife told me about what her mother wants. I said sounds like fun, if she made that choice it would be on her but I already paid for the flights, the rental car, and our hotel room and want the vacation. I told her that she needed to enforce boundaries with her mother and I shouldn't have to compromise and accommodate her mother for her lack of boundaries. If I went along with it I would be doing exactly what she is doing with her mother. 

Her and her mother have had drama for years around stuff like this and it has been manipulative to say the least if not damaging to our plans. My wife has had to cut her off several times. I have no relationship with the woman.

She only rarely gets morning shifts but she has asked for them because of my situation. I am working from home and my main duty involves talking to people on the phone (6-7h/day). 

Luckily, I get to start my day at 10:30am but that is still not good enough for my sister who likes to wake up not before noon, and usually after 2pm, if she doesn't have work. Our room has big built in desks and obviously my work stuff is spread out there. Usually I move all my stuff to this tiny table my mom keeps in her room during the mornings but sometimes I don't want to unplug my chargers, move all my things, and sit in an uncomfortable chair. I can't move to the dining room because other people sleep in a room right beside it, they don't have a door, and they don't get up until 4pm, also a choice. Sometimes my mom works from home and I have nowhere to go but stay in my room and my sister does respect that. 

Right now I am calling people while my sister tries to sleep unsuccessfully and it is 11:30am. She asked me to move but I just don't feel like it today. We both went to bed at midnight and I think she should get over it or get up. This is the first time in maybe 2 weeks I have decided I would rather not move. It is my room after all and I respect her all the time when she decides we need to turn off the lights, or more often, that we can't go to bed yet because she isn't done with her art. The matter of fact is that I think she should respect that it is not very early in the morning and that we share a room that I should get to use.
