META: This sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world,80919,META,6315,d6xoro,1569027100.0,"I’ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I’ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

Given that, I think it’s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

So just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you’re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t try to be involved in your child’s life, no matter how much support you pay. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you’re childfree. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

The internet has its own values, and that’s fine. But in the real world, people who can’t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don’t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

So yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people’s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation. I don’t know if the disparity is just because of reddit’s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don’t want to get down voted to oblivion.

So even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you’re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you’re an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they’re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don’t technically “owe” anyone anything.

Or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.

Edit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

Edit 2: I’ve never seen this movie, but it’s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: “You’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”",False,1574222702.0,2019-09-20 17:51:40
UPDATE: AITA for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that I helped get addicted to drugs?,67570,Update,2,cjetsa,1564451892.0,"I want to sincerely thank everyone who commented. Everyone’s comments were appreciated, including those that were less than pleasant. 

Since I received such great advice on my original post, I felt like I had an obligation to update. And I’m trying to follow through on all aspects of my life, even internet ones. 

The funeral service was held this past Thursday. Before then, I brought all the advice I received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how I was feeling and what I should do. 

My sponsor was straight with me and told me that I would be putting myself in danger by going and that I should do something else that day to grieve. 

When Thursday rolled around, I was a mess. I seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead I grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip. 

We went to the beach and just hung out the two of us. 

I’m doing okay this week, but obviously am still not doing great. 

I haven’t reached out to any of Marcy’s family and I don’t plan to. I understand now how devastating that would be. 

That’s it. Take care everyone.",True,False,2019-07-29 18:58:12
AITA For suing my girlfriend after she had my 1967 impala project taken to the scrapyard?,65405,Not the A-hole,2825,gr8bp3,1590564945.0,"I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA

Edit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all

UPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now

HUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

AITA for pretending to get fired when customers get a temper with me?,63530,Not the A-hole,3692,e5k3z2,1575421673.0,"I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are: 

James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.

Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.

So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.

So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.

So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.

So James came in and was like ""sir is there a problem here"" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like ""OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired."" 

I started acting real sad, like ""no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee"" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.

The angry guy started to backtrack, like ""It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it"" and James was like ""No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service""

Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and ""fire"" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. 

Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.

AITA for making a dad joke?,56953,Everyone Sucks,2032,dhfeg9,1571024486.0,"Note. My step-daughter, Madeline, was about a year old when I married her mother, Jessica. Madeline’s father died before she was born. 
 
Madeline is currently 15, and she’s rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said “You’re not my dad. I don’t have to follow you”. Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn’t mean it, and that she’d probably change. I just replied “I’m still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules.” 
 
That happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping, when Madeline said “I’m hungry. I need food.” I decide to be extremely cheeky and say “Hi Hungry, I’m not your dad.” My son just started to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my wife was berating me “Not to stoop down to her level.” 
 
I honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. And my son agrees. So AITA?
 
Edit: I did adopt her. So legally I am her parent.

 
Mini Update: I’ll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. I go to my daughter’s room after dinner and begin talking with her. “Hey. I’m really sorry that I hurt you by the words I said. And I am really your dad. I changed your diapers, I met your boyfriend, and I plan on helping you through college. And plus I’m legally your dad, so we’re stuck together. But seriously, I’m going to love you like my daughter even if you don’t think I’m your dad. Then I hugged her. She did start to cry.

UPDATE: WIBTA if I took over planning my own funeral from my very religious parents?,56951,UPDATE,2,flan73,1584655884.0,"Hello, everyone. First of all, thank you all for the kind words, support and love that everyone has offered and given. These weeks have been the most difficult I have ever experienced and it is with great sadness that I tell you all that my beautiful and cat crazy wife, has passed. I've had to cut this short due to character limits, sorry all. But, she did leave all of you a note, Reddit. I've copied everything verbatim below. She truly loved everyone and was smiling so much after her first post. I'll take my leave here. Much love.

""Reddit! If you're reading this, I am dead. Pretty crazy to be talking to a dead person, eh? It feels a bit strange to be writing this. If this feels a bit disconnected, I'm sorry. I have to take frequent breaks as I get tired pretty quickly now. My husband offered to write these words (such a sweet ham, I know. Be nice to him, okay?). But, I wanted my last words to be written by me. Long story short, we talked to my parents. A lot of people asked about why my husband wasn't planning the funeral and my parents were taking control. Honestly, my parents didn't take the news of my passing to come well and I suppose their closure(?) was to try and take control of what they could. I'm not angry at them for it, I understand. They had already pre-paid a large portion of the service and to put it plain and simple, it was a shit hand they were dealt. So, we talked to them. I laid it all out for them and somehow, we reached a compromise. Lots of tears. Lots of hugs. And surprisingly, lots of laughs. They admitted that they had been losing their faith with everything that had happened and their way to attempt to find it again was to take control and ""guide me"" into the afterlife. Not my thing though and I explained that I am not them, but their daughter who wanted to live her last weeks in peace, not the turmoil they were putting me through. And while a lot of people stated that funerals are for the living (true true), I firmly believe that a funeral is for the living to remember that person as WHO they were, not what anyone else wanted them to be. My parents seemed to understand when I told them that. They were not on board with the party favor aspect though, kind of a bummer. Pretty lucky to plan my own funeral, honestly. But, now that that is all said and done! Thank you, guys. I was blown away by the responses.I was moved to tears and I wish I had had the chance to meet every single one of you. You all be good now, ight? Take it one day at a time and fucking enjoy yourself! You only get one life, unless you're someone who has survived death than you're just a fucking hero and probably a cat with a few lives to spare. I love you all. I'm resting easy now. This disease sucks and I'm happy to be rid of it. And laugh and love and cry and be sad. Shit happens. I've got to go now, I'm gonna go snuggle my husband and my cats. Keep it real, Reddit.

AITA for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin?,54135,Everyone Sucks,5258,cihc3z,1564261911.0,"We had a family dinner this evening. My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).

Extended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

Eventually my sister got really fed up and said “Shut up, I’m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.” My brother hadn’t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

Anyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he’s a virgin and she didn’t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn’t need to be made fun of like this.

So I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it’s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn’t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

Family is blaming me for their marital problems. I refuse to accept I did anything wrong. My sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all I did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",True,False,2019-07-27 14:11:51

WIBTA for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?,51393,Not the A-hole,7651,dkqv29,1571638751.0,"Dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but I’m struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

We’ve always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I’m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn’t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it’s not YOUR pan. 

She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn’t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they’re colored is so it helps me remember that I’m not to touch them unless I’m cooking vegan. 

That wasn’t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is ‘contaminated’ with animal product, and the fridge has ‘bacon grease fingers’ on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she’s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don’t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it’s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly I’m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife’s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn’t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it’s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I’m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I’m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",True,False,2019-10-20 23:19:11

She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn’t lift a finger to go visit her. 

I tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he’d have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. 

He said no, he didn’t want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

Last week, he told us she’s dumped him. I went on her fb page as we’re all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she’s upset it didn’t work out but these things happen, so we’re on good terms) and looks like she’s with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

I confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time.

So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first.

When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what.

UPDATE WIBTA For planting prickly bushes in my front yard to keep the neighbours kids from my property?,47319,UPDATE,1,hf4bc4,1593045483.0,"I was asked for an update on /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g31n1q/wibta_for_planting_prickly_bushes_in_my_front/

About a week after my post I planted a 'wall' of blackberries and raspberries at the 2 sides of my garden facing the driveway, about 30 cm from the edge so no overhanging branches! On the other side of the berry wall I planted lots stuff like strawberries and tomatoes. To reach the tomatoes and strawberries from the driveway you have either go through the fruitbushes or walk up to my house, walk about 2m along the side of the house and my windows and then walk into my actual garden. Not something you do by mistake.

For about 2 weeks it was somewhat quiet but I still found the kids on my driveway every single days. As far as I know they did not enter the garden and I hadn't noticed them walking around my house anymore, so I figured the bushes were working.

About 1 week ago berry season started and my bushes are now full of raspberries and there's lots of strawberries as well. The neighbours noticed. First I caught the boys picking and eating raspberries so I told them off and dropped them off at home, told their mom I caught them stealing (that's how I see it even though it's fruit) and that I'd call the cops next time. She huffed and told me to grow up, but took the boys inside anyway.

After that it was quiet up until yesterday afternoon, when I went out for a while and found the dad and his 2 sons right in the middle of my garden when I returned, clearing my bushes and plants. I didn't even confront them, just called the cops from a distance as they hadn't noticed me yet and started filming them after making the call. Luckily 2 cops showed up after 10 minutes or so and they confronted the neighbour as they were still picking berries. They told them they were trespassing and that the berry picking was in fact considered stealing and that I could press charges. For the first time I noticed a bit of fear in my neighbour, he was having trouble finding his words and kept looking back at his house (I guess hoping his wife would show to yell at the cops). They all went inside with the cops, so I just went home as well.

After a while the cops came by and asked me if I wanted to press charges. I asked them if they felt like they scared the neighbour enough to stay away. I got a small smile and yes about him, but the wife had just kept shouting at them and her husband about the 'little bitch' living next door. I told them no for now, asked them if I'd be allowed to get an extra camera set up on the wall between my garden and the road to cover the entire front garden + driveway, they said that's allowed as long as it's on my side of the wall.

So, now I'm getting an extra camera installed, one neighbour knows I'm done messing around but his wife isn't there yet and if I ever catch any of them again, the cops will be called and possible charges will follow.",True,False,2020-06-24 17:38:03

Hard to explain but I’m sure anyone with a secondary culture will get what I mean- my mom and dad are great parents but having an English speaking person to guide you through shit when you live in an English speaking country is invaluable imo and my sister trusts me with stuff she won’t necessarily trust my parents with. 

Anyway my girlfriend was FaceTiming me and my sister walked past in shorts and a t shirt cuz it’s hot. My ~~sister~~ gf waited til my sister had left the area ( but not the room) and made a face and said ‘maybe feed her less OP, her thighs are kinda chunky’ 

I saw red and told her to shut the fuck up (just came out my mouth) and immediately ended the call. My sister is a bit chubby but ffs who says stuff like that about a 12 year old girl. 

Literally. Everybody. I. Know. Has been texting me that I’m a POS boyfriend and that how can I disrespect my gf like that. I am expecting an apology from HER but to my shock everybody is expecting ME to apologize.

AITA for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?,44254,Not the A-hole,4342,dtg4jw,1573251922.0,"I (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. My boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

However, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

I've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.

Victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

She looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA?

AITA for jumping out of a bathroom window to avoid my mom’s attempt at forcing a reunion between me and my ex fiancé?,43710,Not the A-hole,1781,efcc8u,1577279190.0,"Some backstory: I had been dating my ex fiancé Sarah for four years. We had been planning to get married in November 2020 but I found out at the start of this month that she cheated on me. She begged me to give her another chance but I broke it off. 


The problem was that being cheated on is, in my mind, completely emasculating and humiliating. So I never told anyone that was the reason we broke up. For obvious reasons, Sarah also didn’t tell people we broke up because she cheated. So people have “blamed” me for the breakup, including my mom. They just see that I dumped her out of the blue. 


I’ve gone very strict no contact with Sarah after I discovered she was cheating on me. Sarah has been talking with my mom and has convinced her that if we could talk one more time, we would be able to reconcile. My mom has been applying hard core pressure on me to talk with Sarah but I’ve explained that there’s no chance we will ever get back together. 


So tonight I go over to my mom’s place because she’s hosting family for Christmas Eve. I’m there for a bit talking with my aunts and uncles and cousins when the doorbell rings and I can see it’s Sarah. I ask wtf is going on and my mom says she invited Sarah so we can work this out in the spirit of the holidays. 


I’m pissed now because the only way to explain my side of the story is to tell everyone I was cheated on. Complete humiliation in front of my whole family. So as my mom goes to the front door, I go into the bathroom. My mom starts knocking on the door saying that I need to come out and talk to my ex like an adult. I say fuck it, kick out the window screen and get in my car and go home. 


My mom called a short while ago saying she’s cutting ties with me over my behavior (she’s really fixated on me jumping out of a window) and that Sarah will always be like a child to her. My sister called me after to ream me out for ruining Christmas. I broke down and told her that Sarah cheated on me which is why I dumped her and didn’t want to see her under any circumstances. She called me a big asshole who was lying to cover for myself.  Am I really in the wrong?",True,False,2019-12-25 05:06:30
AITA for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?,43062,Not the A-hole,4572,cs0bfh,1566158147.0,"Ok this is the worst. I’m losing sleep over this.

I’m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

My brother is gay, but my family doesn’t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century’s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

So my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I’m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it’s kind of a secret, as he hasn’t told my family he is gay.

I’ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.

But he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won’t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn’t accept my brother being gay.

Anyway, that’s his decision not mine, so for now he won’t say anything.

Until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

If it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don’t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don’t want to get the attention away from my fiancée, that’s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it’s a pretty good reason

I asked him why my wedding day, he said it’s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can’t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

I didn’t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

With a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

Next day I got a text and he said “ dont worry, going alone”. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don’t seem to know what’s happening because they didn’t say anything.

He eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

This is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?

PS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

PS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!

Update: spoke to fiancée, couldn’t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

Clarification: I know it won’t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn’t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don’t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother’s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING. Also, MY BROTHER IS NOT THE ASSHOLE. Not at all.",True,1566188713.0,2019-08-18 12:55:47
AITA if I stop paying my daughter’s tuition over a disgusting comment she made towards my new girlfriend?,42913,Everyone Sucks,8498,e3f7tf,1575065508.0,"My (56M) wife died at the young age of 51 from a car accident. I was in deep mourning for about a year after her death. I met my new GF C (43F) around January. C was the one who made me laugh for the first time after my wife died. She’s smart as hell (3 Ivy League degrees), has a dark sense of humor that I love, a terrific cook, and overall an amazing woman who I can imagine spending the rest of my life with. She is also on the heavier side, a fact that becomes relevant later.

I have 2 children, E (25M) and A (19F). They were well aware that I had gotten a new GF before I first introduced them to C this summer. She got along immediately with E, but A was very very standoffish. After that initial meeting I asked A if there was something wrong but she denied it. C made a few more attempts to get to know A but they were all rudely rejected.

E and A both came home for Thanksgiving dinner. I asked A to please be polite during the meal since she’s always been rude in her interactions with C even though C has been nothing but gracious in return. The dinner was going as well as it could have for the first 10 minutes, although I noticed A glaring at C the entire time. When C went to grab her third helping of mashed potatoes, A said “Don’t you think you’ve eaten enough, you fat pig?” C started sobbing immediately and ran off into the bedroom. I felt my face turn red and told A to get out. 

About half an hour after A left I texted her stating that I would no longer pay her tuition unless 1. She apologized to C and 2. C accepts her apology. A must have assumed that I was bluffing because she instead doubled down on her behavior during Thanksgiving dinner. I then logged into her university’s tuition payment website, canceled next semester’s tuition, and sent A the screenshots.

My dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she’s started seeing. I’m 23M and going into my final year of college. My moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. My mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone’s favourite uncle. And while i’m glad everyone else is comfortable, i’m not. 

He isn’t a bad guy, I’m just still grieving my father, and it feels like he’s trying to replace him. He tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn’t because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. Boyfriend thinks it’s only fair because i have siblings now. I think it’s ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

He’s trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. They aren’t lacking for anything but he thinks it’s only fair because ~family~. 

I live in the basement of my moms house. I have since i was 15. When you come in the front door there’s a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. So it’s pretty separate.

Tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. I got a lecture and sent to my room and “possible loss of car privileges.”

I snapped and laid it out for him. I told him i’m leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i’m glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. I told him our relationship won’t be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won’t want to have a relationship with him.

My grandparents made me promise not to give out any money after and I intend to keep  my word.

I never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.

&#x200B;

My intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.

&#x200B;

Just a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.

I'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.

Back in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200B;

Since my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

&#x200B;

I'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.

&#x200B;

After the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up?

So we decided to fuck with the sub.,41145,META,1595,cjresy,1564520321.0,"# Major Update: 60 Minute Contest Mode & Extension of Beta Testing to August 14. 

**We have now updated the contest mode to 60 minutes after significant feedback requesting it. The Beta Test will be extended to August 14.** It has now been approximately 6 days since our test began. We ran into **overwhelmingly** positive feedback, and we thank you all for participating in our beta test so far. Please see below for some comparative information!

**We noticed MASSIVE increases in time until top comment**

> Before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. 

> With the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). (Around 30-40% increase)

> With the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). This is an INCREDIBLE increase and very rare for Reddit as a whole. We're taking this as a win. (Around 120-150% increase)

> Unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. However, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**Currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to Google).**

> We don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. However, we know it was much shorter. I think it was somewhere around half?

> This shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. Longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback). 


**More information to be seen! We will be releasing a poll shortly, along with a new thread.**

# Original Thread Info

Hey all you assholes and judges. We recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. A huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. [Take a look here](https://m.imgur.com/a/vZVv1ag). 

We think that's a problem. A comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. We want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. So, we've decided to fuck with the sub.

# Introducing ~~30-Minute~~ 60-Minute Contest Mode

For the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **Contest Mode.** The comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. You will not be able to see the karma score of comments. After 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. The comment order will be ""Best"" instead. 

**Why did we do this?** The first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. By opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. No one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. We tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). It didn't work out well. A 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",False,1565105632.0,2019-07-30 13:58:41
AITA for telling cashier that wasn’t the girls credit card?,41144,Asshole,7826,cdypge,1563320471.0,"
Throwaway because husband told me I was TA and want to know before I get home and argue. On phone format is bad.

I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she’s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of “it’s fine I have my dads credit card I’m not paying ” which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I’ve told my son multiple times he’s never allowed to use my card so I’m interested to see how this girl thinks she’s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can’t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn’t her card but her father’s and I’m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I’ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don’t think she was ever told no.

Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it’s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I’ve pointed out it wasn’t hers cashier tells her she can’t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it’s still fraud. Girl says it’s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she’s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.

AITA for saying my babysitting rates are $35 an hour?,40712,Not the A-hole,9031,eizcvf,1578006574.0,"I'm a software engineer, with a full time job and a side hustle of doing freelance coding work in my own time. I've always been the type to have a side hustle I put a lot of my free time into; I get really bored sitting idle.

My freelance hourly rates are $60 an hour, and at my full time job, my hourly pay works out to about $40 an hour. So that's how I value my time. 

Anyway, over Christmas vacation, I was staying at my parents house. My cousin was also staying over with her three young kids from Christmas to new year's.

I'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time; in the mornings when my family had no plans. I wasn't in any rush; I was already ahead of schedule on them all, but I didn't really have anything else to do. It was in a really rural area and it's like an hour drive to the nearest anything

Then my cousin and her husband asked if I could babysit all day for three days, so they could visit some friends in the area and hang out with just adults. I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library, and she offered to pay me to babysit.

I said I could if they got close to my freelance rates. She wanted a number, and although my freelance rates are $60 I didn't feel like that was right, it was high. But I didn't want to go too low; honestly babysitting 3 kids would be harder for me than the routine coding work I had for my freelance project. I don't know a lot about kids and I've never babysat for long, and I had a feeling it would be stressful and difficult.

So I said $35, which is below what I make hourly at work, and what is the bare minimum I'd value my time for, if that time is spent doing difficult work. 

And she went crazy at me, saying that's a ridiculous rate for babysitting, that I was entitled and being selfish, that I'm trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options, etc.

I said that's way below what I'd be making if I had the time to do my own work, and I'd be putting off my own work to babysit. 

Her husband then got mad at me saying that I was a 24 year old girl, that I'm damn near a child myself, that my time is not worth that much and it's childish to say that it was. And that I was a stupid girl for not knowing that babysitting costs like 15 an hour, when I grew up and have kids of my own I will see how stupid I was being.

I was kind of done with being called stupid so I just told them I hoped they could find someone else.

AITA for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?,39366,Not the A-hole,2889,d38i34,1568326432.0,"Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

This is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.

Me: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?

My Mom: Nothing.

A long ass pause.

Me: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

My Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

My dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.

So later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.

The conversation ended with this:

Sister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

So my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

So I say my part before leaving.

Me: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.

My mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

Me: No.

My mom: But [me], we really need the money...

Me: That's too bad.

I get up and go off to my room.

So this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, ""what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!""

My mom, who's listening in.

""You've seen her! She won't listen to us!""

Me: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.

My mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.

That was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.

As I'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. Like wtf?",True,False,2019-09-12 15:13:52

Thankfully the offers of charity have stopped (here's hoping they were redirected to their communities) but a good deal of them asking whether or not I stopped being a grinch and started being a good husband and father again.

I also spoke with a financial advisor, who is helping me set up a budget for 2020, and a counselor who helped me realize that I was worth more than the goods I could offer someone.  She recommended 2 separate therapists to me, and neither are taking new patients before the new year, so for now, my wife and I are working on our budget and cleaning out various corners of the house for things to sell.  So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction.

Since my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint).

Inspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank!

Thank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.  I didn't need to accept your gifts to accept your love, and the offers alone changed my life.

So last week, we decided to have a father/daughter bonding weekend. Honestly, it was awesome. I took her bowling, to get a manicure, becoming Disney princesses(I looked awesome as Jasmine), and so forth. She loved it. I loved it. Everyone was happy. Then we decided to go out to eat dinner. “I’m starving, what do you want Maddie?” “Hi Starving, I’m not your daughter”. She had this biggest smirk on her face.

It's bullshit.

My fiance and I thought we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. Well, family started trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. We were surprised, but it was a good surprise.

Then the demands started coming out. They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.

We put our foot down and said:

>Thank you all for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately, it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached. With so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money back.   
>  
>Our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  
>  
>If you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or demands, we will gracefully accept it. But if you believe a gift should come with stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.

This has caused an epic shitstorm. Such to the point where I have people saying they will never come to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled, we're assholes, etc etc etc. My parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing. 

We are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness to do the wedding the way we want.

AITA because I refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she’s very sick? I low key hate her.,38507,Not the A-hole,4364,d1btlg,1567982916.0,"I’m 15 years old. I have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. I’m not sure what’s wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she’s non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn’t understand stuff. That’s probably the easiest way to put it. She’s just a human body with nothing inside. 

She’s my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don’t know my stepmom very well and I don’t really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I’m basically living with strangers because she’s so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I’m used to it now.

Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That’s fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don’t want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they’re disappointed that I don’t get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

My own mom passed away when I was small so I can’t go and stay anywhere else and all in all I’m just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don’t want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don’t want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn’t ask for this. 

Anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don’t want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don’t want to go and visit someone who doesn’t even know I’m there. 

My stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven’t yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don’t want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don’t need to force myself to go to the hospital so I’m assuming my dad has told her I’m refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I’m not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom.

Hey guys! So many people wanted me to update on my previous post and wanted me to seek professional advice first before I take matters into my own hands. Apologies if it is long. I'll try to make it as detailed as possible while making this short.

I went to my local therapist and told him about my situation and asked what to do. To keep it short, he said he's heard similar recounts from before and said it is best if I tell him as soon as possible for multiple reasons and to **make sure that my bio-children are present** (multiple reasons). I asked a few of my closest friends and the majority said more or less the same thing.

My wife and I decided to sit the kids down and burst the big bubble. I asked my brother Josh to come closer and I made sure I held him close and make him feel comfortable. He asked ""What's going on?"" but I started by telling us how much we cared and loved for him, then told him everything about my parents (I put them in a bright light in hopes of a reunion) and who I am to him, then quickly hugged him and my other two kids together and told him that I love all my children the same and NOTHING is going to change my love for him. He was shocked and asked if I was joking, but I was starting to cry a little at this point, so he knew I was serious. My bio-children were very surprised too. He was in tears and asked me why I didn't tell him sooner. I didn't know what to say and said ""I was just trying to protect you, I'm sorry and I hope you can forgive me"", but unfortunately and understandably, he left.

He didn't talk to me as much, again, understandably so. I continuously offered him to go out to the park and play a bit of football (he loves that) and all his favourite things, but he just outright declined and even got a little angry sometimes for me even talking to him. I thought I messed up big-time, until one day while my wife and two children were out doing shopping and we were alone, he came up to me and said ""I know you're not my real father, but I want to let you know you're the best dad in the whole world. Sorry for before."" I hugged him and things got pretty emotional. It would be a big lie to say my house is normal now (far from that), but things are slowly - ever so slowly - starting to brighten up. There's no longer anything to hide anymore and it feels like we are born again.

Josh is a tough kid, and he handled this far better than I believed he would. I'll be looking into therapy for him to help him recover just incase it doesn't go well in the long run. I'll strive and continue to be a great dad to my kids, and a great dad to my brother/son. Thank you Reddit for pushing me towards this happy ending. Thank you for all the advice and judgements I got (excluding the rude ones about my uncles and aunts -- eeek!) I love you all. Good night.",True,1579901489.0,2020-01-24 21:23:53
UPDATE : AITAH for giving guardianship of my son to my aunt over my mother after I die of my terminal cancer,38120,UPDATE,726,hh9avd,1593352295.0,"First of I'd like to say thanks to everyone who gave their suggestions and well wishes, unfortunately I didn't get to read everybody's comments as there are too many but thanks to everyone anyway.

Now onto the update. I gave my mother a few days to calm herself down before speaking to her again, she eventually came around. She recognises that it's not optimal for my son to stay with her and that he would be better with my aunt. She knows that my brother is a slob and is giving him a good kick up the arse to get his life together and shit. I have spoken with a lawyer who has helped me with a lot of things including getting my son legally adopted by my aunt and her husband. He will still be staying with me until i... pass
As a lot of you suggested I made recordings and videos of myself giving him advice for his milestones. For example: when he looses his first tooth, turning the ages 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, his first girlfriend(or boyfriend if he likes, I've made a video in case he is in any way lgbt+) leaving secondary school, going uni, getting married or if he has any kids. There are also things I've put into writing, like how his mother died and that he was supposed to grow up with a twin brother that also sadly passed. I've also had my lawyer help me set up a little trust to will him £40,000(from my girlfriends father when he died, she put the money in a joint bank account that I got when she passed) in case he needs help with university or decides to go travelling. All I have to do now is to enjoy the time I have left with him, I've moved my younger brother into my flat so that there will be someone to find me everyday for when I go.

When I'm gone I can at least be comforted by the fact that the son I love so much is being taken care of and that I will see the girl I love again and our other angel I never got to meet.

There are hundreds of business travelers coming through even at 1 AM, and a huge fleet of taxis / ubers standing by to take them home.

I usually wake her up for pretty much everything because she sleeps through her phone alarm no matter how long it buzzes or how many she sets. 

She has joked that I’m her butler before and within the context of a relationship it’s ok so I didn’t mind, obviously I want to love my partner and try make her life easy. 

However last night she was chatting with her friends and she thought I couldn’t hear. She was bragging that I’m her little bitch and I do everything for her when she tells me to, etc. It really hurt my feelings because they were making comments like ‘good, put him in his place’ and she was agreeing. 

She specifically said ‘yeah I’m not worried about tomorrow because the bitch will make sure I’m up and he’ll probably have breakfast ready for me too’ 

I went to bed pretty hurt by it, and come morning I didn’t bother to wake her up when her alarm started to go. She usually only gets up when someone physically shakes her, but I let her turn off her alarm and she slipped back into sleep and I turned around and went back to sleep too. 

When she woke up she was yelling at me saying I’m an asshole and I’ve cost her her exam and I’m a piece of shit for what I did.

It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

After the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him.

I have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed.

AITA for taking back the beer I bought for a party from which I was uninvited?,37106,Not the A-hole,1820,hd12gs,1592744414.0,"This happened just a few hours ago. I am a 19 year old man and the people calling me an asshole are 18 year old men and women. 

On Thursday, a person I had a major crush on in high school (but who rejected me) messaged me out of the blue. She had never contacted me without my contacting her first, and at one point I realized she had had me blocked on social media, and so I found it odd that she was suddenly being friendly. After sending a couple of greetings/questions about how I've been, she said that she was going to have some people over and wanted to know if I would get the beer. The drinking age where we are is 19, and she and the people who were going to chill were all 18. The liquor stores in my area all card.

I thought it was silly that my being a month older meant I could buy liquor and they couldn't, and so I said I would love to go. She said ""thanks, I'll pick you up at seven!""

7 o'clock rolled around, and she texted me to say she was in front of my house. I went out dressed and ready to chill with some people, and she drove me to the liquor store. When we got there, I asked what beer she wanted me to get, and she told me to get Budweiser. I hid my disappointment as well as I could, but it was her party so I went in and bought two cases of 24. 

I got back in the car and said ""let's party,"" and she was eerily quiet. I noticed that she wasn't driving towards her neighborhood, but rather back towards mine. I thought she had moved or something, but didn't want to press the issue. When she turned down my street I finally figured it out. She was being purposefully vague about the invitation because she wanted me to get the beer, but she wanted a way out when she told me I wasn't actually invited in the first place.

She stopped in front of my house, leaned over, kissed me on the cheek, and said ""thanks!"" in her best voice. I deadpanned her and asked when she was going to tell me I wasn't invited. She feigned surprise and said that she never intended to invite me in the first place. I sat in silence for a long awkward minute, picked up the beer, and walked towards my front door. She got out of her car and frantically tried to reinvite me to the party, but I told her that what she did was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. I opened my front door, slammed it a bit too hard, and came back to my room.

Now I'm sitting here drinking absolutely unpalatable piss water, and I have text messages from all of her friends and her asking me why I'm being such a dick.

Anyway last week I posted a group picture on Instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. Everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other’s shoulders. Very platonic. 

Anyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don’t want “the public” to know they are dating. I would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don’t. Also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them. 

Anyway I asked what they meant, and they said they didn’t want to end up in gossip rags....

I pointed out that they are not famous and that they don’t even have functioning IMDb pages. They were livid and called me a bunch of names.

AITA for leaving significant facial scarring uncovered on a plane and being confrontational when a father asked me to cover it because it was scaring his son?,36307,Not the A-hole,2822,f3asns,1581633128.0,"
I sustained very bad injuries to my face this month. I'm in the stage of healing when the scar tissue has formed, but it's still very tender ""new skin"". I'm going to have very obvious facial scarring for the rest of my life. The injury starts about an inch above my hairline, goes down over my brow so that on part, hair will not grow. It continues down my cheek where it is deepest; I'll always probably have an indentation in the fullest part of my cheek. Then it continues to my jawline. 

In some ways it's OK. I'm happy it's just cosmetic damage. My friends are super reassuring, telling me how badass and sick it's gonna look. They say I'm still as hot as ever, now a little more sexy and mysterious lol.

But in some ways it really sucks... I know that I'm always gonna be seen first as ""the girl with the scar"" and it feels especially bad when people look at me differently.

This week, I had to fly home for a family thing; it was a plan I'd made long before my injury. I wasn't really looking forward to the pity or people making a big deal of it; I'd rather it not be acknowledged.

I'd also met with my dermatologist who said that I was at the stage of scar tissue formation that I no longer should be dressing the wounds; the skin was healing and instead I needed to be applying topical cream and Vaseline to keep the site clean and moist. 

It also looks a bit ugly; the building scar tissue is very red and tender, and with the Vaseline over it, looks slick and shiny.

So I get on this flight; I have the window seat and I put on my headphones and drift off to sleep when the plane is still boarding.

I wake up to this kid, maybe 4 years old, sat next to me, throwing a tantrum. I didn't catch the first part of it and I honestly couldn't understand what he was yelling about... 

His father said to me, ""Can you cover that injury?"" 

I said that my dermatologist recommends I don't, so no I don't think I will. 

He started snapping at me saying ""there is no need to be so rude. That injury is graphic and it's scaring my little one.""

I said ""this is my face. The only damn face I've got. It sucks being told I'm so ugly I can't show my goddamn face in public.""

He started to backtrack saying ""just until it's healed"" and I said ""it'll always be with me. Maybe teach some fucking compassion and respect instead of telling a girl half your damn age what you think about her face. That's rude. 

He actually got up after that and I think went to a stewardess about a seat change because a young couple came to sit next to me on a few minutes instead. I've gotta admit I felt so low that I put on my sunglasses and had a quiet cry for a few minutes.

AITA for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?,36222,Not the A-hole,8955,cw43oc,1566939525.0,"Hi all. 

I gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte. 

My cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault.

Well recently she gave me a scrapbook she made. She had counted every thing I baked her apparently, and she gave me this scrapbook after I baked her, her 100th dessert. It was filled with a picture of every dessert I've baked and pictures of me baking  and her eating. She wrote a paragraph about each item I baked. Each item was dated too. She had been working on this for 2 years. She also wrote a long letter on how proud she is of my baking hobby, thanking me for the sweets, and telling me how much she loves me. It was the sweetest gift I've ever gotten and I honestly cried.

AITA for admitting I regret having children.,36014,Not the A-hole,5272,e7t57k,1575836669.0,"My wife and I are both 42 and in marriage counselling after our marriage basically went to shit after having kids (6 and 4 year old twins). A lot of issues and disagreements have come up in our marriage that have driven us apart and I have been working through my resentment that going back for one more baby resulted in twins, including one which we are pretty sure has ADHD and ODD and is a *nightmare* child). 

Our counsellor asked me if I would have children if I had to do it all over again and I said ""honestly, no"". 

I love my kids and would take a bullet for them, but if I had the chance to go back to 24 when I finished grad school and could do my life over again, I wouldn't choose fatherhood. It is not the fulfilling experience everyone claims and while I love my children, the sacrifices are not worth it to me. I had a much happier life before having children and have gone from someone who loved life to someone who just.....makes it through the day, working a job he hates to provide for the wife and kids while silently wishing this wasn't my life. 

My wife is *furious* and taking it the wrong way and even told our 6 year old ""daddy wishes you were never born"" which makes me livid. You don't tell the kid that.

Yes, I wish I never had kids, but I do love them, would never hurt them or want to upset them. And I didn't say it to/in front of my kids and I never ever will. I said it in marriage counselling, what should be a safe space to talk about feelings. 

It has become a huge fight, our marriage is not going to be saved now, and I know she will try and use this against my in divorce court to try and get sole custody and take everything and lie to the kids who I do love and still want to be a Dad to them. She is incapable of understanding that you can love your kids but also feel that parenthood was the best choice for you. 
 
AITA for saying it though?

Edit: Ok this blew the fuck up and there is no way I can reply to everyone's questions. But to address a couple I have 3 kids not 4. One child is 6, two are four. English is not my first language and I forgot the comma, and even so that sentence would have been much clearer in my native language. 

When I say I resent having twins, I am not saying it is my wife's fault! But 3 children is more than we budgeted/bargained for and I need to pick up a lot overtime I that I would not have had to pick up if we just had 2 kids, and that is what I resent (that and the child with ADHD/ODD). My life is basically work and dealing with my kids. And do you know what ODD is? This child always refuses to do what is asked, gets angry and throws a tantrum when asked to do something he doesn't want to do, hits and kicks others, deliberately annoys and hurts others, is extremely spiteful, screams and kicks me constantly. ALWAYS. All day. Every day. It's exhausting and it is hell. 

Yeah. I would't have him again. Most people wouldn't if they had to raise him.  

Just because I wouldn't do this over again doesn't mean I'm not committed to being a good dad and being present in their lives. I just would not do it over again if I could redo my adult life. 

My first kid was not born at 24, I just said that because if I could do my whole post-University life differently, I would change some other things too (mainly career) and to be honest, after all this, I regret marrying my wife, which is why I said it that way.

Regarding calling the ADHD/ODD twin a nightmare, go google what that means. It is very difficult to manage and he has even been kicked out of three daycare places because they could not handle him and my parents even refuse to babysit him.

Update: AITA for shutting down all black names because I think it'll make my son's life harder?,35822,Update,2,d1ti7b,1568076639.0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ck2eaj/aita_for_shutting_down_black_names_because_i/

I posted a month ago about a dilemma my husband and I were having with our baby's name. We had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. My husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black American culture. I wanted a more neutral name since I am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. We found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. His name will be....

Miles Trayvon

We thought it was a perfect compromise. My husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be ""Tray"" to most of them. When he's in school his name will just be listed as Miles (last name). He can officially be Miles T. (Last name) if he doesn't want to use Trayvon but he can also easily go by Trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. This option gives him the choice, which my husband and I agreed was important. My husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. He talked about how in 8 Mile Eminem's character says something like, ""This guy's a gangsta? His real name is Clarence."" That's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. He's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.

I had the opposite experience. My mom is white and my dad is black. They decided on a stereotypical black name and I think it made my life harder. Professional I go by a nickname and I do personally as well. When talking about it with my husband I realized it started early. I remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. A woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma I was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. Instead of saying my real name my grandma said, ""Her name is Daisy."" I attended an HBCU and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. For example, Raquan Smith would put ""Ray Smith"", Demarcus Jones would put ""Marcus Jones"", Keshawnda Nelson would put ""Shawna Nelson"", etc. They said you had to play within the system and I did that.

Anyway, sorry for the long update. I just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. We didn't really get deep into it until after I posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. Before anyone says it, I do realize some people will connect Trayvon to Trayvon Martin. That's not why we are using it. I posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but I don't mean to offend anyone. It's a family name on my husband's side.

Edit: Thanks for all the DMs but please stop sending me articles about the woman named Marijuana Pepsi and the black Spider-Man named Miles. Thanks y'all.",True,1568062916.0,2019-09-09 17:50:39
AITA for telling my wife it’s not ‘cute’ for her to encourage our teenage daughter to expect her boyfriend to pay for EVERYTHING in their relationship?,35667,Not the A-hole,2280,gnkxa5,1590043656.0,"Wife and I have been married 18 years, we have our 16 year old daughter who has been dating a slightly shy/ awkward young man for around 3-4 months now. 

He seems very nervous around my daughter and has admitted in a passing comment here and there to my wife and I that he can’t believe she agreed to date him and he thinks she’s way out of his league. He seems very respectful, just shy.  

My wife is usually an independent, awesome woman and her ideals align closely with mine particularly in term of feminism and equality. We have both striven to raise our daughter to be as independent and capable as possible. 

Since my daughter has been dating this kid my wife has changed considerably and has given our daughter advice that has left me with raised brows more than once. 

Some of the advice I’ve heard my wife give is ‘oh it’s cute for boys to pay for everything, especially in your first relationship!’ Or ‘oh honey don’t worry about that, he can pay for you, if he really liked you he would’ and similar. 

I’ve tried to balance this out by telling my daughter straight away ‘two people in a partnership should be contributing equally’ and my personal favorite ‘if someone asks if they can *take you out* to dinner, it’s reasonable to expect them to pay, but if someone asks you to grab dinner with them, it’s reasonable to split the payment’. I figured that would be an easy way for a young person to understand the difference. 

However I’ve noticed my daughter becoming more and more entitled with her boyfriends money. They haven’t been anywhere obviously since we’re home but the way she talks about him ‘oh I’ll just ask him to pay for x’ etc leaves a bad taste in my mouth. She has also flippantly bragged/ mentioned that she gets him to buy gift cards for her etc by mentioning her mother’s advice, i.e. ‘if you really liked me you’d pay for x’ 

I spoke to my wife privately and told her my concerns, she insists it’s a rite of passage for girls and it’s cute that she should feel a guy is completely spoiling her. I told her that it’s not cute for her to be thinking it’s acceptable to view relationships as personal ATMS, and my wife became very angry with me and is now calling me an asshole with a lot of hostility.",True,False,2020-05-20 23:47:36
AITA for suggesting/letting my 17 year old son get drunk?,35576,Not the A-hole,4808,e9bilu,1576120198.0,"I (46M) live with my wife and my 17 year old son. My wife has been on a different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has just been me and my son for that time.

My son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in my province), and teenage drinking is very common.

I asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports game that night, as a ""test run"" of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me.

We had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party.

I was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his ""first experience"" drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless and irresponsible.

AITA for telling my stepdaughter to stop using period products in the bathroom she shares with my teenage sons?,35512,Asshole,4903,h0a45w,1591821771.0,"I have been living with my new wife and stepdaughter for about 6 months now. She’s 19, almost 20, and I have three sons aged 18, 16 and 15. She’s a really good kid and she’s a good influence on my sons, I really enjoy having her around. My wife and her daughter moved into my house and sold theirs. My stepdaughters father isn’t present in her life, nor is my sons’ mother. All four children share a bathroom.

My sons have never lived for a long period of time with a woman, nor have any of them had long term girlfriends. They had short visitation periods when they were younger but never longer than an hour, so living with two women has been unusual for them. 

My eldest son, 18, came to me last week and told me that his stepsister disposes of her used sanitary products in the trash can they share, but doesn’t use toilet roll or sandwich bags to disguise what they are, and it makes him uncomfortable which I think is reasonable. My sons are teenage boys and don’t want to see their stepsisters period products on full display.

A few nights ago I went into the kitchen to grab a snack and she was there doing some work for university. My wife had mentioned that she knew she was on her period so I took it as an opportunity to have a word with her. I told her my sons were uncomfortable and asked her if she’d mind putting her used products in diaper bags or flushing them down the toilet. 

She laughed and told me it was rich coming from a man who “sheds like a gorilla” and has produced “three skid marking sons” which I thought was just an unnecessary attack. I’ve been nothing but nice to the girl and it’s hardly a comparison. My sons shouldn’t be subjected to her unhygienic products if it makes them uncomfortable. She went on to lecture me about how tampons can’t be flushed and that it’s bad for the environment if she uses diaper bags for every one which I think is just an excuse. I called her a scruff and told her that this was my house and that what I say goes. 

I later asked my wife if she could have a word with her and she told me I was being ridiculous and that her daughter has had her period for ten years and knows what she’s doing. When I told her it was making my sons uncomfortable she said my sons needed to get a grip and turned over and went to sleep. 

This is a genuine issue to me and she didn’t care enough to have a discussion about it. I asked my stepdaughter again in the morning and she did the same as her mother, completely dismissed it. Both of them have told me to stop being so silly but I don’t see how I’m being unreasonable when it makes my sons uncomfortable. AITA?

UPDATE — Not even two hours after I posted this, my wife and stepdaughter gathered my sons and I and gave us a full intensive “periods for pricks” course, Powerpoint and all.

Many people messaged me asking for an update, so here it is.

So, most of you told me that I should just voice out my support for the LGBT community instead of directly talking to my brother about his sexuality. This was very helpful as I did not want him to feel pressured to come out.

When I wrote my original post, I was already watching Schitt's Creek, which had non-straight main characters. This was really convenient because I could simply say remarks like ""Awww, they make a really nice couple"" and ""Wow, I wish my relationship with my gf was like that.""

I also asked my bro about Pride month (he has been going to marches as an ally for the past few years with his out friends). I asked him ""Hey, what's their plan for Pride month during quarantine? Too bad they can't hold the march, I was thinking of joining.""

I didn't really know how to be subtle, okay.

When our parents went grocery shopping last weekend, that's when he told me. ""You already know, don't you?"" I knew what he was asking but I tried to play dumb. ""You know, that I'm gay, right?""

I just said yes, told him about the iPad incident, and hugged him. He cried and asked me not to tell our parents, which of course I agreed to. He then asked if this changes anything between us, to which I replied ""Of course, now you have to give me better fashion advice!"" (I make jokes when I'm emotional, okay)

I told him he has my support no matter what, and that I can help him come out to our parents when he's ready. I also told him that he and his boyfriend (which he confirmed) are a great couple, then I reminded him that they should always be ""safe"" (Giving sex advice to my brother was VERY awkward).

That's it. He's still annoying as hell, because, you know, he's my brother, but I've never seen him happier, and I can really feel that a burden has been lifted off his shoulders.

Thanks, everyone!

​

Five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.

​

Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said ""This is John"" and described my job.

​

Ted: ""Hi, Jack.""

Me: ""It's John.""

​
Ted: ""What?""
​

Me: ""My name's John, not Jack.""

Ted: ""It's close enough for me.""

Supervisor: ""His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.""

​

This continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""

​

Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.

​

Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says ""Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

As promised, I ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

The first one was along the lines of ""Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.""

E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

I signed out and went home. It was raining hard.

Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!"" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

Supervisor: ""Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.""

​

I relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.

Supervisor: ""I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

A few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.

AITA for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her African American boyfriend to her grandparents?,34388,Asshole,7659,d6cfsz,1568919908.0,"Let me just preface this by saying this: **I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIPS.** Now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

My daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal). While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

My parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

As I said, I know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

Anna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

To preface this, I (24F) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought. 


Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" To which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong. 

I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the CHICKENS!!!""). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges.

AITA for leaving my wife by herself when she talks in a cringy manner,34068,Everyone Sucks,3799,dk2rkt,1571514835.0,"Ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.


Rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. She would make noises in between conversations like ""Bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""Awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. This is especially embarrassing when I am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


I have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. I have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


It was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. We went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


""Yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. Owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?""

AITA for blowing up at my stepsister at her comments about my lost weight?,34056,Not the A-hole,1949,efz1kb,1577414145.0,"My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.

When I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was ""cooler"" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like ""fatass"" and ""chubster"". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).

By the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, ""He's still pretty big"", ""Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness"", ""Maybe lose a little more around that gut"". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.

Now here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, ""Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?"" I flipped out. I yelled, ""Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?""She said back to me, ""Defensive much?""  
""Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?"" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. ""Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!"" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, ""Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!""  
""But you're way older!"" she whined.

I left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to.

AITA?

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your comments and the awards. I've never felt better about myself than now. And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not ""bordering"" on obese.

UPDATE: AITA for raining on my cousin's parade regarding the name she picked out for her baby?,34073,UPDATE,1,ha6c24,1592350639.0,"[My post last summer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/btred7/aita_for_raining_on_my_cousins_parade_regarding/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=AmItheAsshole&utm_content=t3_h9mcqc) wasn't the most exciting or dramatic on AITA, but I wanted to provide an update if anyone is interested.

Baby Karen was born healthy and happy back in October. She's an absolute sweetheart of a baby, and I'm totally in love with her. Between March and May, I didn't get to see her at all in person, but I was doing regular FaceTime/House Party calls with Stephanie and Karen, and over the last few weeks, I've been going over to Stephanie's house to sit in her backyard and chat with Stephanie/coo at Karen from a lengthy distance.

I have two reasons for updating. First, I've realized since Karen's birth that her name has taken on new meaning to me. When I'm with her, Karen just means *her*, and I don't think about the other connotations. In other words, you guys were right!

That said, though, my second reason for updating is that Stephanie got back into her years-unused Facebook at the beginning of the pandemic to keep in touch with people. She's been on it pretty regularly lately for the first time in years (historically, she's not really been into social media). Most people in our area/social circle have been posting really heavily about BLM and the protests happening right now, as well as racial justice issues more generally. As a result, Stephanie has now come into contact with a *deluge* of Karen memes for the first time, and found them confusing and horrifying, especially the use of ""Karen"" as shorthand for a racist. I've basically just declined to talk about it with Stephanie, because it went so poorly last time, but both *my* mother and *her* mother have hounded me about it because it's upsetting to Stephanie, and said things like, ""Is *this* what you were talking about before? Why didn't you say so? Why didn't you explain it better?! You should have told Stephanie!!""

And Jesus wept!! You really can't win.

Thanks again for all your feedback on my last post! It was very helpful in giving me some Zen about the situation.

Edit: Wow, I've been super overwhelmed by the *flood* of very kind, heartfelt PMs (and just one or two not so kind ones) as well as the comments on my other post. Thank you, everyone!

"AITA because I ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night?",34041,Asshole,3219,ca7bdz,1562538033.0,"What I thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and I'm up at 7:05 AM dealing with it. I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad. 

I'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough. 

Last night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

Well to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

I offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

I woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

Was I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

Edit: I guess I’ve been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so I can’t find out why.

To answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn’t a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it’s about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don’t get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",True,1562526783.0,2019-07-07 15:20:33

I thanked her for her apology. When she asked if she was forgiven, and I tried to avoid answering. I am still not over what she did to me. What Z did to me impacted me greatly, as I was a impressionable young girl. I struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. 

Z started getting defensive. She told me that I was being petty and that I should forgive her. I told her, “Why? You will always be the boy that bullied me.  An apology won’t change that.” She got really offended when I said the word boy, and said that I was misgendering her.

He tells me to “calm down” and that if I want to be here then he needs to do this. I tell him he’s being ridiculous and I try to push past him. He stops me and tells me that he doesn’t want to throw me out but he “will if he has to.” I told him that he’s trying to look tough but it’s just making him look stupid. 

At this point I’m getting more and more angry and I’m practically yelling in his face at this point. Bystanders came between us and separated us and told my BIL to just “drop it.” He said he would but that “they can deal with it when I get out of hand.”

I just went to go find a seat after that. 

After the reception, a lot of my family told me that I should’ve let him just do it and that I was acting like a huge asshole and like I had “something to hide.” 

I don’t think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and I don’t think my reaction was over the top. If anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. My sister has refused to take any sides in this.

I found a website that will print custom jackets, print all over the front and back and arms... And I ordered some hoodies that say a bunch of phrases all over them.

""No photos"" ""no videos"" ""i do not consent to be photographed"" ""no means no"" ""respect my privacy"" ""no cameras"" ""no profiting off my image""

It sounds silly but it looks pretty sick actually. I got one for me and one for my nine year old sister who's started to not always want photos.

And I guess the idea is that my mom can't take good looking pictures, even candid ones, with us in the hoodies without them having a pretty strong message that we don't want to be in pictures.

My mom was mad when they showed up, and really mad when I'm wearing mine. Like she says she just wants pictures to remember my young years by, she won't post ones without asking

But I know that's a whole mess anyway; she always says that and then negotiates me into letting her post, like either by saying that's how she makes income so if I want money for something, to stop arguing about pictures. Or posting without asking and then saying I thought it would be ok because you're face wasn't visible / you're just in the background, etc.

I know it's really weird looking but it feels like my only option.

Edit to add a couple more things... She also says all the mentions of consent and ""no means no"" and ""this body is my own"" (sorry forgot to mention that one earlier) imply something more inappropriate and that it is really inappropriate to wear those words out in public.

So I wasn't expecting to make an update post, because I honestly wasn't expecting there to be an update to this. Unfortunately, I'm wrong.

I gave my oldest two weeks to really think about whether he wanted to talk to my sister or not. I figured that the decision he made at first might have been made out of anger, so I wanted to give him time to make such an important decision.

Ultimately, he decided that he did actually want to talk to her. I have to admit I was a little bit surprised, but we set up a zoom call between them anyway (of course with me supervising). Right before the zoom call he admitted to me that he wanted to talk to her, ""Just to see if she'll say sorry,"".

She did not say sorry.

Actually she opened the call with, ""Hello! It's been so long! I guess you're ready come home with me now?"", and then she noticed that I was sitting there with him, and almost immediately launched into accusations about ""alienation"" and how I ""have to give the kids back now or she'll call the police and say I kidnapped them,"". My oldest was very obviously disgusted. He asked her if she was going to apologize to him, and she actually had the audacity to ask what she had to apologize for.

At that point, he just shut off the zoom call. I asked him if he was okay, but he spent the rest of the afternoon in his room by himself.

That night he told me that he never wanted to talk to her again, ever. I told him that never is a long time, but that we weren't going to make him talk to her if he didn't want to, and we were never, ever going to give him back to her.

He told me that never is a long time. We told him that in this case, it meant never.

&#x200B;

I'm still shocked. I don't know what happened to my sister. She was my best friend as a kid. She was almost my second mother. She was sweet and caring and nice, I just don't know how all that changed so fast. Or maybe it didn't change that fast and I just never noticed until it was too late and I was driving four hours away at midnight to pick up three little kids, one of which I didn't even know existed.

Before now, I honestly never considered myself as their parent, even after I legally adopted them. More like I was just taking care of them long term. But now I realize that those kids are my kids. And they're going to be my kids for the rest of my (and hopefully their) lives.

Ten years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. 

So here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. 

So recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't. AITA?",True,False,2019-12-23 12:22:44
Update to AITA for not tell my Dad he isn't getting the inheritance he is expecting?,32888,UPDATE,955,e8b87k,1575933445.0,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dgfkt3/aita_for_not_telling_my_dad_he_isnt_getting_the

A lot of people have asked me for updates so I thought id make one.

It was kind of positive?

I agreed with many comments in my first post where they said my grandparents were setting me up for drama.

I talked to my grandparents and shared these concerns. They were understanding and setup a family meeting with them, their lawyer, my dad, his wife, and myself.

I was secretly hoping that my grandparents would get over some of their issues with my dad and his wife but nope. My dad's wife actually started crying and wailing when they revealed that I would be getting most of the inheritance. I could see my grandmother almost exploding. My dad to his credit, looked disappointed but said it was their money to do as they wished.

The new agreement is that my father will receive $75k, and each of my younger siblings will receive a 50K education fund.

My dad's wife did call me a few days later and acted really foolishly. And she somehow thought that insulting my mother would help her.

I told her that if she ever said something bad about my mother again I would tell my grandparents about it. That seems to have shut her up.

My relationship with my dad was never the greatest. But I haven't really seen any further decline in the relationship.

But I feel a lot of relief now. Thanks everyone!",False,False,2019-12-09 15:17:25
"AITA for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiancé that I cheated 9 years ago?",32375,Everyone Sucks,7678,chb37s,1564017605.0,"For reference, my brother Connor is 19, I am 26, and my (now ex) fiancé Hunter is 28. Also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

Connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it’d be fun to act like college students again.

We all got pretty drunk and Connor had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever. A few rounds in, the statement “Never Have I Ever cheated before” came up.

Now’s a good time to mention that Hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. His ex-fiancé cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. And unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, I cheated on my “boyfriend” of 5 months. It was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. This was almost a decade ago, I obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

Well my brother knows about this so when I didn’t drink, he went “hey sis, what the hell? You know you cheated on (*insert ex’s name*). You have to drink to that!”

My boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. I followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn’t haven’t any of it and ended things on the spot. I’m numb. I’m heartbroken. He was my everything and more and I still don’t know how I’m going to move on.

Connor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. This morning I served him an eviction notice. He begged me to stay and said he didn’t mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn’t think when he said those words. I just can’t look at him right now. He ruined my life. After I raised him and cared for him like he was my own. I feel so hurt. Am I being unreasonable?",True,False,2019-07-24 18:20:05
UPDATE AITA for taking a 3 hour nap every day and expecting my husband to look after the kids and only wake me up for emergencies?,32295,UPDATE,1193,gnzjp6,1590105748.0,"It's been a while since I last posted but a lot has happened so I figured I should update you. 

Making this post has been an eye opener for me and I decided there and then that I was done. So thanks to everyone who told me what I desperately needed to hear. 

I started gathering evidence which would allow me to leave relatively savely. After I had enough evidence I prepared to leave. I gathered all documents and secretly packed up some stuff for the kids and myself. I informed my parents and my brother about the situation. My parents immediately turned my brother's old room into the new kids room and my old room has never stopped being mine. I waited for my husband to be gone and then my brother picked us all up. 

I left a message for my husband explaining that I wasn't coming back and that I'd be filing for divorce. I also told him about all the evidence so he wouldn't do anything stupid. 

I've been at my parents' for nearly a week now. We have a carer who stays here 3 nights a week and I share the other 4 nights with both my parents. My dad is retired so he looks after the kids for a good portion of the day. 

I have talked to a lawyer and she said I will likely get full custody. 
My soon to be ex has left some nasty messages but hasn't shown up so I feel relatively safe. I don't think he will fight for custody since he was always disappointed that our daughter wasn't a son and our son isn't the strong little boy that he wanted either. 

As of now I will stay with my parents. The kids are happy, my parents are happy and I had 7 hours of sleep last night.",True,False,2020-05-21 17:02:28
AITA for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?,31888,Not the A-hole,3225,cmcou6,1565049044.0,"Train is packed, it's hot, I'm tired and looking for a place to sit. Everything was occupied, but at one point I see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. I went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. I asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.

As soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. So I started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

This released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. I saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so I figured I'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. My bad, I'll get up now"". I got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as I was walking away.

I noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so I kinda wondered if I stepped too much out of line there.",False,False,2019-08-05 16:50:44
AITA for blowing up at my friend who constantly makes comments about my boobs?,31891,Not the A-hole,2516,giww2y,1589396594.0,"I have big boobs. I’m currently at 52kg and there’s nothing I can do to change the size of these things unless I have surgery. I’m also extremely shy and from a very conservative family so my resentment and shame towards my bust is an ongoing issue. 

My friend *Sarah is one of those unfiltered free thinkers who says whatever is on her mind. She’s also slim and her chest is very much in proportion to the rest of her body. We work together and I’m always secretly jealous of how great shirts and tops look on her whereas I feel I look very sloppy and unprofessional with oversized, ill fitting clothes. 

Sarah has this way of always bringing up my boobs in conversation, starting off complimentary but often ending with an subtle insult. She knows they’re a physical feature I’m uncomfortable with but doesn’t let up. Examples of things she’ll say is how my boobs look good now but give it a few years, and they’ll be down to my knees, hahaha! Or she’ll show me comments on reddit where people are discussing chest size preferences and most are commenting how they much prefer a smaller bust over large. Or just a general reminder of how work or men will never take me seriously because of my ‘cartoon boobs’. I know she’s trying to have lighthearted fun but it gets to me and I’ve told her a few times to drop it before. 

Now we’re working from home, we all have daily video calls and meetings. Uniform is not necessary and can wear what we like. A few days ago, it was extremely hot and I was wearing a lighter, more revealing top than my usual baggy coverups. During this video call, in front of 6 other colleagues, Sarah starts vocalising her thoughts on my appearance: *‘Holy shit! Put those away! You look like you’re in a porno. We don’t need to see that first thing in the morning, hahaha.’* I was mortified. One other colleague laughed along but the rest looked uncomfortable. I felt close to tears, made an excuse and left the meeting. Sarah called me up half an hour later asking me what was wrong and I went off on her. Told her to go fuck herself and was sick of her constant jabs about my appearance. I went on a 10 minute tirade and hung up. Sarah has been off sick since that day and we haven’t spoken again. I’m wondering if I was too harsh and maybe should call and apologise for my outburst? Was I TA?



**Edit:** I’m fuming. I just spoke with a colleague, *John, (who was part of the video call that day) and he told me that Sarah’s been telling everyone that it’s ME that’s been bullying her and making her feel insecure about her appearance. When she made those comments during the meeting, it was in retaliation to how I’ve made her feel. Apparently, I said she looks like a boy and called her flat chested and ugly several times in the past. I have NEVER and would never say this! I don’t even understand the stupid ‘boy body’ insult because a small bust has always looked very beautiful and classy in my eyes. Anyway, John knows she’s full of shit and has suggested we speak with HR. The others will also back me up. I know most people here suggested I do this and I wasn’t sure at first but fuck it, I’m reporting her. I don’t know why I ever considered her a friend, she’s fucking mental and annoying.


**Edit 2:** I now feel stupid for even asking the question AITA. I thought I may have been at one point because the video call was amongst mostly work mates rather than clients and I wasn’t sure if my sensitivity towards my body image made me overreact to a joke that could have been innocent (I now realise it wasn’t).

I’ve also spoken to another coworker who is closer to Sarah and she thinks Sarah may have  already reported me to HR. She said the phone conversation we had after the meeting was filled with abusive bullying language and physical threats. It wasn’t a pleasant phone call but the worst thing I said was she go fuck herself and that I don’t want to speak to her again. The rest of the conversation was just rehashing all the comments she made about my body and how it made me feel. She also claimed that I have been making inappropriate jokes about her appearance and work ethic(?) through the years and this confrontation was a long time coming. She also suggested that I’ve convinced the guys in the office to take my side by being a flirt and a tease (did I mention that I’m stupidly shy?)

My head is swimming and I think I may be dealing with an actual psycho. I don’t know how it’s come to this ridiculous level of craziness. All I wanted to do was get on with my fucking work in peace and get through this crappy time but now I have to deal with this bullshit.


**Update:** Just to answer a few questions I’ve seen:

- I’ve contacted HR with my complaint. I have a lot of old text messages and emails with comments and memes Sarah has sent making fun of my chest size. John and other colleagues are fully supporting me as well as my manager. It will take a while for them to get back to me but I’m confident that things will be sorted and Sarah will be dealt with.

- My breasts alone aren’t 52kg (114lbs). My overall weight is 52kg. I mentioned this because my chest seems much larger on my small frame making clothes that others wear and look nice in, look completely gaudy and cheap on me. I can’t lose anymore weight to make a difference on my bust size. I won’t get surgery but I have been working on my body image issues which my shyness and upbringing did a number on. People’s comments don’t usually devastate me as they once did but Sarah obviously tried her best to break me down.

- Thank you to all for clothing suggestions. I will definitely look into tailoring some tops and have spent some time checking out Bravissimo which looks great.

- In hindsight, I should have confronted Sarah more sternly in the past but I guess I was trying to avoid conflict. Others have suggested I may have allowed her to gaslight me which may be true. I just want to move on at this point.


**Update 2:**

The coworker (*Lucy), who keeps in contact with Sarah and told me earlier that Sarah may have reported me to HR, has just phoned to tell me that Sarah has suffered a serious panic attack. Lucy does not want to take sides but has suggested I reconsider taking drastic action. Sarah is too unwell to talk to me herself but has asked I drop my complaint and she will drop hers, citing the whole thing as a misunderstanding and stress-induced disagreement. 

I have had panic attacks before in my life and I seriously felt like I was going to die. It’s a horrible feeling and if Sarah has honestly just had one herself, I don’t want to push her too far. I still want to address her comments over the video call but I’m wondering if I should just drop the other complaints. Sarah has asked to move teams so we don’t directly work with one another but it doesn’t seem she wants to apologise yet. And just to clarify to people who assume I was wearing a bikini top or boob tube during the meeting, I wasn’t. It was a short sleeved plain tshirt which hugged my breasts more than my usual baggy tops. 

I don’t like to hold grudges and I think getting her fired during a time like this may be a shitty thing to do. I feel she has already punished herself by displaying this fucked up behaviour to others and losing a lot of respect from coworkers. If we don’t ever have to interact with one another, I’m up for that. I have a suspicion that Sarah may have found this post and read it which I thought I would feel bad about but I really don’t care.


**Last Update:**

I’m not dropping any of the complaints. Sarah (fuck you Michelle) and I have spoken, and although it started off promising, she is mentally unhinged and without a conscience. I did not realise how deep her hatred runs. Not only did she mock all those things I had told her in confidence about the way my family treated me growing up, she accused me of fucking every guy from work to get ahead. Now I know where some of those fake office rumours about me came from. I’ve been such a naive idiot and allowed my shyness and aversion to conflict to stop me from fighting people who manipulate and walk all over me. I don’t need this misery in my life. If she’s reading this, get professional help immediately. I know you desperately fancy John and, as you said, despise the way he looks at me. I know it bothers you that he took my side and has been a great support. Maybe I will go for drinks with him when lockdown ends. 

If I don’t make any new updates, just assume that the right person was reprimanded and faced the consequences of their words and actions.",True,1589402620.0,2020-05-13 12:03:14
AITA for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?,31809,Not the A-hole,2865,cyt2nl,1567478440.0,"I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

I told them ""you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense."" But they kind of laughed my warning off.

Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.

To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

AITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",False,1567449724.0,2019-09-02 19:40:40
AITA for gifting my sister pictures of my dog?,31769,Not the A-hole,2640,ef49r2,1577237107.0,"I'm a bit of a jackass I will admit, but hear me out. So today I was at my parent's house to celebrate Christmas Eve with my side of the family (as this year I will be spending Christmas with my girlfriend's this year). Anyways, we opened presents up early this morning. Something I should note about my sister is that she LOVES her children. Which is great and I do love my nephews, but every year she gets me magnets, pictures, blankets and pretty much anything she can plaster her kids on. 

While it's nice, I don't have a shrine at my house dedicated to them and I know this might sound selfish, but I don't really want them as I don't know what to do with them. They end up in a drawer or something, cause one year she got me a large tapestry thing with her kids on it, and it was HUGE. Obviously I didn't want to hang it up as it quite literally covered the entire wall. I never say anything to her as I don't want to offend her and ruin Christmas.

So that's when I had the genius idea of doing the same thing but with my dog. I put him in a little tie, took his picture and put it in a frame. I love my dog as my child, so I figured I'd gift it to my sister. (I also got her a $25 Starbucks card as she's obsessed with them and I wasn't trying to be petty). Anyways, she opens it up and her face drops. Then she goes to me and says, ""what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?"" Without a thought I said, ""same thing I do with yours, it'll look good on your coffee table"". 

Long story short, she got mad, my family is pretty much on my side expect for a couple of people who thought it was funny but in the end ""dogs aren't comparable to humans"".

AITA for starting my wedding on time and not waiting for my parents?,31675,No A-holes here,4626,dz2eyy,1574287214.0,"I got married on Saturday, and it was absolutely amazing except for one thing: my parents showed up late. They knew the ceremony time, and my husband and I made it very clear to everyone, both in the invites and in person, that we were going to start exactly at that time. The venue cost us a lot of money (we paid for the entire wedding ourselves) and we were only able to use it for a limited amount of time, so we wanted to make every minute count. 

So the wedding day came, and half an hour before we were scheduled to start, my parents still hadn't showed up. My husband and I both called them multiple times but nobody answered. We waited and waited, and still heard nothing. Finally, the start time arrived and my parents still weren't there. I was really pissed off at this point. The wedding coordinator asked if I wanted to go ahead and start the wedding, and I said yes. All of our other guests were already there, and we wanted to be considerate of their time. 

My parents showed up 15 minutes later and missed the entire ceremony. It turns out they did leave early but got rear-ended at a traffic light and had to deal with insurance, police, etc. They only have a landline, no cellphones, so they couldn't get in touch with me.

AITA for laughing uncontrollably at my son when he asked me to replace a Christmas gift he broke out of anger?,31591,Not the A-hole,3488,ei9igg,1577858419.0,"I know I likely am, but the extend of which I'm unsure about. 

My son is almost 17. This Christmas we bought him an expensive computer gaming chair, as he plays a lot of online multiplayer shooters. My son has some anger issues, which he's currently in therapy for, and these shooters tend to bring out his temper more than normal. However, for the past few months he's been keeping it together well, so I figured the chair might be a fair present. 

I was wrong, because the day after Christmas he was gaming, started to have bad luck and apparently people in-game were fucking with him because he was losing his patience. This culminated in him screaming insults and then picking up his chair and slamming it into the ground, breaking the back of it.

After talking him down, we had a very serious conversation about him no longer being allowed to play multiplayer games while under my roof until his therapist feels comfortable with his progress, talked about coping mechanisms, etc. However, I made it very clear this was unacceptable and he would be grounded. We've had these heart-to-hearts many times, so it's not like every time he has an outburst I'm making light of it. It's a serious issue and treated like such.

However, when he came to me later that day and told me he'd like me to replace the chair because it was a gift, he ""really liked it"" and ""it would only be fair"", the frustration, disbelief and disappointment in his behavior boiled over and I started laughing hysterically. As in a full laughing fit, barely able to breathe or talk. The more he'd plead his case, the harder I'd laugh, repeatedly asking him how it was ""fair"" in his mind to have me replace a gift I paid for that he broke in anger.

This obviously pissed him off more, which led to him getting emotional, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself. I tried walking out of the room and asking him to drop it but every time he'd say ""but I need a chair!"" or ""What am I supposed to do now"" I'd laugh again. I tried explaining that I'm not laughing at his feelings, I'm laughing at how absurd it is for him as a teenager to expect me to replace shit he can't be bothered to treat with respect and then whine about it when he broke it.

He's still pissed about it, and feels slighted. I feel bad for laughing, and honestly wonder if I had some sort of mini-stress break myself, because it's never happened before and I couldn't seem to stop. But at the same time, I stand by the fact that his request *was* ridiculous enough to make most people *want* to laugh. How badly did I fuck up?",False,False,2019-12-31 22:00:19
AITA for telling my autistic brother the truth when he asked me why women don’t like him?,31433,Not the A-hole,2449,gbl3wk,1588378693.0,"I’ve got a younger brother (24) with Aspergers and he’s very high functioning albeit with his quirks. 

Recently I’ve moved back home during the stay at home orders to look after my parents. My brother still lives with them. I find out he’s been trying to date in recent months and confessed it’s been pretty unsuccessful for him. He even got to go on a first date but his date literally got up and left after about a half hour. 

I know exactly the reason why and it’s not flattering. For one thing my parents coddled him since he was a kid because he was on the spectrum and was the only boy in our family. My mom in particular always told him he was smarter and more advanced than everyone else who’s neurotypical. This has led to his belief today that he genuinely is smarter than everyone else, especially women who he thinks are inherently irrational, illogical people. 

So I know how he interacts with women like me or his other sisters. He tends to say very hurtful things first and when we get upset, he will then say things like “you are being irrational/hysterical/illogical, I’m just being honest and you can’t accept it.” This is like his catch phrase over the years and drives us absolutely INSANE. 

Anyways when he asked me I basically said, “listen the truth is your way of talking to women can come across as extremely demeaning and borderline sexist.” I told him he acts like he can read every woman perfectly when he’s pretty much always wrong. This struck the wrong nerve with him and he later complained to my parents that I attacked him over things he can’t control. 

Now I’m in hot water for “ruining his confidence” and I feel both bad and kinda relieved at the same time. This was the first time in my life I told him how annoying his behavior is because growing up our mom always blamed us whenever he got upset. But maybe I was too harsh?

AITA for telling my male friend that he’s shit at sex,31343,Not the A-hole,2421,h0jty3,1591850810.0,"One of my (24F) male friends, I’ll call Jack (25M), is a bit of a lad and very good looking. Jack basically thinks that lad points are important, he’s always going on about how many girls he’s been with and how high is body count is. I lived with him in a house share for a while and whenever he bought a girl home, he’d make sure to parade her around by introducing her, spend 15-20mins in his room having sex, then come out and strut around naked or in his boxers..yes he really would. I remember saying a few times why are you out here, you have a beautiful girl in your room and you’re not in there with her?

This behaviour was pretty common for him and even though he was an almighty douche, we were still friends. Anyway after about 8 months of living together, after a drunken night, me and Jack ended up in bed together. Honestly it was terrible and having slept with him I realised something. Jack had a big dick (which I knew because of his strutting) but he thought that having a big dick automatically meant he was good at sex. Like it just immediately made him amazing in bed. Our sex was shit, like hands down the worst sex I’d ever had. No foreplay, he left lights and tv on, then unceremoniously shoved himself inside me. The whole thing was basically a race for him to get inside me as quickly as possible. Maybe 10 minutes of uncomfortable jackhammering then he was done. The next morning I was really sore because 1. I wasn’t wet at all 2. His dick was big. But because I was sore he took that as him doing a bang up job. Anyway that experience was a few years ago, and even after all this time, Jack is still the same lad he was and still fucks girls like they’re lined up on a conveyor belt for him. 

Back to the present. Recently, my husband and I hosted a bbq in our garden as gatherings are now allowed. Jack came over as he’s in our mutuals group. Of course after a while Jack starts going on about the girls he’s fucked, and even showing up another girl at the party by telling people he’d fucked her. It’s then he turns to me and asks if I can prove to the lads how “fire” he is at sex. Slightly embarrassed but also angry he even mentioned me, I straight up told him he was shit. Basically worst sex I ever had, I then went onto say what happened and that he only has sex just to say that he’s had sex. It wasn’t fun, pleasurable or enjoyable and for the record I didn’t come. Amazingly enough, two other girls also backed up what I was saying. Saying their nights with him were pretty much the same to how I described it. Jack got defensive and angry but we wouldn’t drop it. He eventually left absolutely fuming. 

My husband, who knows I slept with him years before said I was insensitive, especially as it seems jack relies heavily on the lad/sex God persona he’s created. I don’t think so, it was about time Jack was called out for being shit in bed and maybe use this to learn how to actually have sex.  All the boys in the group think I’m an ass for calling Jack out, me and the girls disagree.



EDIT: - Holy cow this got way more attention than I thought it would! Thanks for all the comments.l and thank you kind strangers for the awards!!

Should clear a few things up. A lot of people asking why I was or am friends with Jack. I was back then, because honestly at times he was a decent guy, just blanketed by a douchey exterior. After I moved out of the house, we fell out of close contact but are still hovering in mutual friend circles. I’m not directly friends with him now but he’s still a friend of a friend and we are normally civil.

EDIT #2: I really don’t get why people are misunderstanding the story. For the record I did not cheat on my husband. Jack and I had a one night stand together years ago while we were at uni. I wouldn’t consider him my friend now but we still have mutuals from different social circles and we do occasionally still see one another.

INFO: Basically my friend group (close/mutual/extended) all knew or knew of each other at uni. I’m British and now live in the states. I attended Uni between the ages of 18 - 21. At 19 I went to the states for a year abroad, and the sister Uni is where I met my now husband. Jack is American and was an international student doing exchange, I was first year he was second year. I, a first year, ended up living with Jack because I decided to go to uni last minute, and as Halls were full, ended up responding to a house share ad (a lot of students drop out after making a house share commitment so these ads are common)

I actually met my husband (also American) through Jack, as Jack was one of my only known contacts when I moved to the states. (My British uni and his American uni were linked) I met my husband a year AFTER I slept with Jack. I could not possibly have had any idea that my housemate and one night stand would go on to introduce me to my future husband. My husband knew Jack and I slept together because unfunnily enough, Jack brought it upon our first meeting.

Living together, Jack and I mainly bonded over weed and raves, and although he was sometimes somewhat decent, looking back I’m disgusted at our so called friendship. I could write an essay on how he treated me.

UPDATE: AITA for throwing away my husband's Xbox after he refused to look for our lost dog?,31259,UPDATE,2027,ghaqsu,1589177414.0,"Original post, here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g64rsj/aita_for_throwing_away_my_husbands_xbox_after_he/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


First of all, thank you everyone for your immensely kind and considerate responses. I am thankful to each and everyone of you to give me such beautiful and encouraging messages. These kept me going, no joke. 


Tippy was found 2 miles away from our house, a day after I posted ads and posters on several platforms and websites. A kind lady living alone had found him near her street, starving and exhausted. She responded to my calls for help on Facebook and I am utterly thankful to her. We need more people like her in this world :') 


My son and Tippy are both ecstatic to be reunited, he takes care of him just like he did before, only now I have some time on my hands to help him as well. However, my son is still wary of his father and he'll likely remain so for a long time. Now he doesn't ask him for help at all. 


As for my husband, he now treats Tippy as if he doesn't exist. He went and bought a new xbox controller right after Tippy was brought back and now demands that I pay him for damaging his property. I am willing to pay because I realise my impulsive response was not the best decision and nor was it the best way to deal with my situation. My approach towards my husband's Xbox and my husband's approach towards Tippy were both horrible and irrational. 


Many of you mentioned that my husband may have been neglecting our daughter. It's unfortunate that you were right. 


I started to notice some tender area and red skin around my daughter's diaper area around 2 weeks ago. She was uncomfortable, irritable and put up a fuss every time I tried to change her diaper. Turns out she was suffering from a diaper rash. 


Diaper rashes can occur for a variety of reasons, none of which were applying to my daughter. She wasn't on antibiotics, she had soft cotton clothes, her bowel movements were normal and we weren't using any new products on her. This left only one option. Her diapers weren't being changed frequently. I was away from home for 5 days. I asked my husband how many times he had changed her diapers. 


A baby her age needs her diaper changed at least once every 3 hours. My husband outright said he was changing them every 7 hours or so for those 5 days because he didn't think that they needed to be changed as much as before because she was now 6 months old. He had raised a son with me before, it's a ridiculous excuse. 


The diaper rash is gone now, but now I am scared to ever leave my baby with him when I go to work. I will have to sit down and reconsider everything and have a long talk with him soon. It's inevitable. He still plays Xbox just like he used to play before.


I will never forget how a bunch of strangers jumped to help me find our dog. Thank you, you lovely people. ♥️

UPDATE: AITA for not telling my fiancee I used to work as an escort?,31178,UPDATE,870,fliqbb,1584683877.0,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/fdejfv/aita_for_not_telling_my_fiancee_i_used_to_work_as

So I thought of what everyone said and considered both sides. I decided that I didn't want this hanging over my head in our marriage. So it was tough, but shortly afterwards one night I had a few glasses of wine and told him I had something I needed to talk about. I had considered seducing him, having sex and then telling him so I could at least do it one last time but decided that would be manipulative and dishonest. 

So I sat down and told him: When I said I had ""a lot"" of sexual partners it was over a stint of about 4 months as an escort.

He was taken back a bit and said ""That's not something I'd expect."" I figured no one would, I dress modestly, I'm pretty conservative with drinking and I volunteer with the kids programs at my church.

I had tears in my eyes and asked him if his opinion of me had changed. He said ""Well what you did didn't stop you from being the woman I fell in love with so why should it?"" I started crying more...tears of joy. 

I begged him to let me know if he had any apprehensions or questions or if it'd come between us in any way. He said he might have questions about any cool or sexy stories sometime but for now no. He even made a quip about ""No wonder you blow my mind in having sex, you were a professional!"" Not really the type of joke I'd normally appreciate but in that time it was perfect. And we ended up going to the bedroom not too much later.

So now I feel like a huge weight has been lifted and I know just how much my fiancee loves me and what he's willing to tolerate in me. It's wonderful! We're both in lockdown basically now, both working from home and I'm so thankful to be able to be with a wonderful and amazing man who I love so much and who loves me so much.

Thanks to everyone!",True,False,2020-03-19 22:57:57
AITA for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that I helped get addicted to drugs?,31048,Asshole,948,cg1u8p,1563760308.0,"I’m 26 and clean from heroin for 3 years. 

I was also a piece of shit and used to deal for a while. 

I managed to get with a beautiful girl named Marcy when I first started getting into the thick of things. She knew who I was but she said she loved me. 

I will regret this for the rest of my life, but I was the person who shot up Marcy for the first time. After that, there was no stopping her. She stuck around with me, probably because I was her dealer more than anything, but then I got clean and never saw her again for a long time. 

A year ago she reached out to me on Facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn’t hate me for what happened and she hoped I was still clean. 

Last week I got a call from my sister who told me that she saw on Facebook that Marcy had OD’d and there was a funeral service this upcoming Thursday.

I immediately just burst into tears because I hoped that this would never happen and I feel so much guilt over it. 

I want to go to the funeral service for her but I’m afraid that my presence would be unwanted. At the most I would just slip in the back, pay my respects and leave. I need to do this for myself.

AITA for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?,30967,Not the A-hole,6642,cb6xz4,1562735492.0,"When my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. There would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no.

Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and I said ""Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

This has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

The car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

"AITA for disowning my brother when he came out as gay, because of how he's treating his wife?",30906,Not the A-hole,1786,ggmc1h,1589082745.0,"I (21f) have a brother (28) who came out as gay last month. He has been married to my best friend's big sister (24) for four years, they have 2yo twin daughters together. I'm really close with her, so I've been trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation. 

My brother told his wife he's gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. He said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from Grindr for over a year behind her back. She obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. He said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. She asked him what about the effect on her life? She is now a single mother to two toddlers. He was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. After she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with. 

Since then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. He has expressed that he still doesn't want to be public about coming out, so he posted on Facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren't in love anymore and hinted SHE was the unfaithful one (posting things like 'yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn't satisfied with just one man') and is basically being a dick.

I told him a couple weeks ago that he's a fucking asshole and I don't want to be involved with him anymore because I think it's disgusting that he's treated his wife like this. I told him I get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). He said I'm being a homophobic asshole, and that I don't know how hard it is to come out. He said that if I don't accept him, I'm a bigot. He made mistakes and what not. I said maybe I will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. I gave up at this point.

AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy me pads?,30856,Not the A-hole,1297,gp0at9,1590244799.0,"Okay, throwaway because my boyfriend knows my other account. 

I (23f) moved in with my boyfriend (24m) of two years a couple months ago. We haven’t had any problems before this argument. Things had been going pretty well. 

Anyways, a couple days ago, I got my period. It came early and I had ran out of pads. I couldn’t leave to buy some because I bleed pretty heavily and I would’ve bled through my pants. So I asked my boyfriend if he could buy pads for me from the drugstore, because it was late. He immediately said no. I was shocked because I wasn’t really expecting that. 

I asked him why. He said that he didn’t want the cashier to see him buying pads. At this point I started laughing because that was hilarious. He wasn’t joking though. He just glared at me. I told him that the cashier would obviously know it wasn’t for him. Plus, the cashier would definitely not care what he was buying. He still refused. I told him that he could go to the self checkout machine if he was so insecure, but he said that he didn’t want anyone to see him with the pads because they’d think he was a “tr***y”. I told him that he was childish, and that his masculinity was really fragile if he couldn’t even buy pads for his own girlfriend. He got mad and went out. I had to bunch up toilet paper as a makeshift pad, wear black pants and a long cardigan and go buy the pads myself. My boyfriend has been ignoring me ever since. I’ve been thinking that maybe I might’ve pushed it too far.

So AITA for telling my boyfriend that his masculinity was fragile after he refused to buy pads for me?

*Edit*: *Wow, thank you for all your replies! I’m definitely going to have a serious talk with my boyfriend in the morning about this and we’ll see how it goes*

**UPDATE**: First off, thank you for all your awards, replies and stories, they all mean so much to me. I confronted my boyfriend an hour ago. We sat down together and I told him that I didn’t like how he acted about buying pads for me. He said that he didn’t feel like he had to, and that I could’ve “held it in” and drove to the drugstore to get the pads myself. I told him that you can’t “hold in” menstrual blood, but he insisted that I could’ve done it for a few minutes and that it wouldn’t be a big deal. We went back and forth over this so I just dropped it. 

I asked him (like most of you mentioned) what would happen when we have kids and he’d have to take care of me and buy me nipple cream, take me to the washroom, etc. He said that I would not need those things because I should be able to do them on my own after giving birth. He said that there wasn’t anything hard about using the bathroom and the only reason I’d need help is if I was a “cripple”. Then I asked him about the tr***y comment. He said that he didn’t understand why people would want to change the gender they were born in. That basically cemented everything for me. I felt completely betrayed and humiliated. 

I can’t believe I spent two years of my life with a guy who holds these views, and I can’t believe I was too oblivious to it. I just feel so dumb. I told him that we need to break up. He cussed at me and told me that I was exaggerating and that I was being a bitch. I told him that I would send him my half of this month’s rent (we live together but it was his appartement so we would split the bill). Then I packed my bags and drove to my parents house without saying another word. I’m gonna be staying with my parents until I sort myself out. I’m feeling really down right now, because I really did love him, but I also feel relieved. Again, thank you all for helping me out, and sending me encouraging messages.

AITA for suing my ex?,30824,Not the A-hole,2629,h9emck,1592249905.0,"So I dated a YouTuber.

We went out for about a year and it was alright but they were so emotionally invested in their channel that they constantly neglected me and made me feel like I wasn't a priority.

Not really important why we broke up, but we broke up.

Then I get a bunch of messages from friends about 3 months later telling me to go to their channel. I'm pretty much done with them but I do and I realise they made a video about me where they claim I was emotionally abusive.

I continued to get messages from strangers telling me how awful a person I was and how they hoped I died through various means.

So I sued my ex.

It ruined them. I knew they were financially in a bad spot and they likely couldn't afford court fees but the case dragged.

They made a video about not being able to afford court costs and such and how it was going to ruin them.

After which a bunch of friends started telling me to just let it go and move on but I had sunk money into the case as well. It wasn't cheap for me either so I didn't just let it go.

Eventually the judge ruled in my favor and I received a total of nothing from my ex......

But it meant I could link to the result in the comments section of every video she tried to frame me as the bad guy because in our state, court proceedings are public record.

Suddenly her viewership dropped and she blamed me for ruining her life.

A bunch of my friends said I went too far and should've just taken the court win and left her alone.

AITA for having a wedding and not disclosing we were already legally married?,30747,Not the A-hole,3293,d9m02m,1569544062.0,"About two months ago, my husband and I got “married” in a beautiful ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it’s their only daughter’s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). 

The wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn’t have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he “proposed” (something I didn’t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. 

Very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren’t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn’t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I’ll call her Carol) and I aren’t close. She’s fine enough in low doses, but...

We’re currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must’ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date. 

Carol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a “gift grab” (our wedding website stated that someone’s presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband’s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. 

For me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront?

In one split second, the happy family I knew was gone, and I went through the darkest time in my life.

My parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.

My mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate. I am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. He was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.

This year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.

The thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. Though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when I think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and I have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. I'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. They are her parents after all.

AITA for serving a pregnant woman a non-alcoholic cocktail?,30561,Asshole,2774,ch3vqi,1563974424.0,"I have waited tables for the last three years.

During my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. 

When I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables.

About five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me. 

A few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.

It was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber.

Several minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager.

AITA for refusing to visit my dad after my room was converted to an office/bedroom?,30416,Not the A-hole,3325,e52dls,1575336885.0,"I used to visit my dad most weekends and all of summer.

He recently got remarried to someone I actually have a decent relationship with. I also have two stepbrothers who are younger and who I don't really interact with.

My dad has a four bedroom house. So all the kids have a bedroom.

When I went to visit last month, I was ""surprised"" with a renovated room. And by renovated I mean it was converted to an office with a couch that pulls out to a bed. It did look nice I suppose.

Apparently my stepmother works from home and needed an office.

I didn't cry or throw a tantrum. I slept in the room that weekend and have refused to stay the night since.

I was really hurt and felt like I didn't matter. My mom tried to convince me to go back but gave up after I told her I was old enough to decide.

My dad is stressing out and has apologized and said he'll change the room back but honestly, I'm done. This was the final thing that sealed the deal for me. I told him that as well. I told him I'll come for day visits and we can have dinners but I won't be staying overnight anymore.

AITA for correcting my daughter’s teacher about her name?,30098,Not the A-hole,4091,go5wwj,1590125981.0,"My 7 year old daughter’s doing virtual school in our living room recently. I heard her teacher address a girl named Kelly a few times, which stuck out to me because my daughter’s class is only about 15 kids and I know them all by this point in the year. 

A couple times more and I realized she was calling my daughter Kelly. My daughter’s name is Keeley, pronounced Kee-Lee. 

So after school was over I asked her if that had been happening all year in this teacher’s class and she said it had and it really annoyed her. I asked her why she hadn’t corrected the teacher if it annoyed her so much and she said she had repeatedly at the beginning of the year but the teacher kept calling her Kelly, so eventually she gave up on reminding her. 

I sent the teacher a quick email explaining the misunderstanding but got no response. This teacher teaches a special subject (think music, gym, art, or language), not just one grade level, so my daughter will be in her classes for the next several years, so we couldn’t just wait it out. And how moments like these are handled now will set the stage for how my kid deals with similar situations on her own in the working world. 

I encouraged my daughter to come to class early or stay late her again, thinking maybe she hadn’t heard or understood her last time, so a quiet one on one would be better.

She got to the class early and she told her very politely that her name was “Keeley like really, instead of Kelly like jelly” and that people often get it confused so she just wanted to clarify.

So class starts and sure enough she gets called Kelly again almost immediately. So there’s only so much self advocation a seven year old can be expected to do. I just walked over and said “Hi, this is *Keeley’s* Dad. Her’s name not Kelly. It’s Keeley. Hard E. Sorry for any confusion.” 

A few hours later I had an email in my inbox “inviting” my wife and I to a parent teacher conference with the vice principle. 

The long and short of the meeting ended up being the school feels that while the teacher probably should’ve learned her name, that the real problem is she feels I challenged her authority by correcting her in class and that the names were “similar enough” for it to “not have warranted such drastic action.”

That surprised me. I couldn’t believe a meeting was necessary, let alone that it cast blame on us. 

I can’t tell if I’m being that annoying “my kid matters most” parent that my grandmother the schoolteacher always complained about or if the teacher should just learn her damn name because that’s a basic part of her job. AITA?",False,False,2020-05-21 22:39:41
AITA for grounding my daughter because she called my SIL a “slut”?,30087,Asshole,4059,cqbhfo,1565826431.0,"My daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. A boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. I believe he sent a video to her as well. Before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. It appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. I notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.

&#x200B;

My husband and I are respectful and non-judgmental of my SIL’s profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. My daughter is understandably upset and I feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. She unfriended my SIL from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. She refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my SIL house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. I tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.

&#x200B;

My SIL is hurt from all of this. Not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. Last weekend, I went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. My daughter refused and referred my SIL as “a vapid slut” and her husband “a pathetic cuck” along with other slurs I don’t want to repeat.

&#x200B;

I grounded her for three months and took away her internet. My husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that’s too much. He also admitted he struggled accepting his sister’s career path at first. He thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Seems like my husband is right and I went too far with the punishment. I just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. I’m going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. Will decide with the husband later. We’re definitely concerned for our daughter about what’s happening at school and we’re looking into therapy.

I don't know how he has such a high turnover rate but I'm guessing it's to do with him being both rich and a raging narcissist. He invited me to get coffee and introduced me to his new fiancee. I knew he was going to do this because two of my brothers (there are 7 of us total, none have the same mother) said that they had just gotten coffee with dad and met the fiancee, then been invited to the wedding, and both had been given a plus one for their girlfriends of 8 and 10 months respectively.

Dad told me to bring my ""partner"" when I came for coffee and I brought my (trans) boyfriend along. We have been together for 3 years. The fiancee seemed nice, wanting to know about me and my boyfriend and asking questions that sounded like she actually gave a shit. Dad gets all the details of the engagement/wedding out of the way and then asks me, and only me, if I'll be there.

I notice that he was talking to just me, not my boyfriend, so I say ""*we* will check if *we're* free"".

Dad replies that ""this is family only""

I reply, ""I just assumed, seeing as how the other siblings got plus ones""

Dad says ""that's different. Are you coming?""

I say ""we'll catch the next one"".

Dad's fiancee becomes visibly upset and they leave. Dad texts me after that if I can be civil on the day then I can still come alone.

I felt like I had to stick up for my boyfriend because this was definitely due to him being transgender, and he thanked me at the time but told me that I should probably still go, but after reporting back to my siblings to say what had happened I got mixed responses. The overall opinion was that while I absolutely should stick up for my boyfriend this was some hill to die on and I managed to catch the actually nice fiancee in the crossfire and upset dad, too.

Info: I am a woman. My boyfriend is trans FTM. Despite both of us being straight, dad thinks of us as lesbians due to my boyfriend's biology.

I was hanging out with a friend of mine and a group of her friends. We were all talking and having drinks, and the topic of dating comes up in conversation. 

For some background information; I’ve only had one boyfriend (I’m 24) we dated for 4 years, and broke up about a year ago. I’m mostly a loner. I’m fine with being single right now and have no interest in dating at the moment. My friend knows this. 

She starts lightly teasing me in front of her friends, pretty much calling me a spinster. She “dates” a lot. Every week she tells me about two or so guys that she’s slept with. This kind of started a pile on, where everyone was teasing me, and giving me unsolicited advice. I tried to placate it, but she kept bringing the conversation back to me and my (lack of) a sex life. 

Eventually I got really heated, and just said “so is your crotch still burning or is that cleared up? What did they say about that? Was it guy 104 or 105 that gave it to you?”

Like three weeks ago she called me crying to take her to the clinic because she had painful itchy blisters on her groin, turned out to be herpes. I did it without judging her at the time. 

She quickly stood up and left the table. I tried to follow her to apologize and she went off about me outing her to her friends. She was telling me how I was the only person she trusted, and she couldn’t believe I would act that way. I tried to remind her how she and her friends were dog piling me, and she said it was just jokes, I didn’t have to react that way. 

We are obviously not speaking right now. Was what I did justifiable self defense? I know I probably wouldn’t have done it without liquid courage.

I was born in fairly well to do Hindu family. I fell in love and married a Muslim man and had to convert to his religion. My family was pretty pissed off that I converted but we've kept in touch.

Recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. My mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.

My sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. I was happy for her.

It all began when I asked what religion he was. Imagine my surprise when she said that he was Hindu AND THE SAME COMMUNITY AS OUR PARENTS. This would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.

I asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. She got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. 
I suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.

I explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. It was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. 

She told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and I was being rude. I told her that I wasn't, I was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  I then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.
 
At this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. At this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.


Later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. She called me 'toxic'.

i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are. 

 this caused a massive fight where I was called ungrateful and that I'm not a nice daughter. so I walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn’t wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me.

My brother found out before I could bring it up to him and called me, saying I was being inconsiderate and couldn't believe he hadn't been asked. This got me irritated, because in my opinion, I have just a right to share my name as he did with his wife. He and his wife have been married for over a year and I think they feel possessive about the fact they were the only ones ""supposed"" to carry on our name.

I think the fact that this is an issue at all is rather sexist. It's my last name too and if I want to give my future husband--who has never had the privilege of feeling like he belongs to a family-- my name, no one should take issue. I have three sisters who aren't yet married, but they shouldn't have to feel bad about giving their name either. I don't feel like I'm being selfish here, but AITA for breaking tradition?

Jack celebrated his birthday in September, and as many of you suggested, I told him that I'm sorry but my gift for him was shipped late and would be arriving in two weeks. That way it didn't look like Kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy Kim's gift. 

Kim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that I was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. It's flattering to read that so many of you think that Joe and I are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with Kim. It was humbling for Kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. Hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. 

For those who are asking, I didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because I wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone I know in real life who might also be participating in this forum.

AITA for lying about my biggest fear on a quiz show and subsequently winning a car and making other contestants lose?,29397,No A-holes here,2328,dmfsum,1571949495.0,"This is a hot topic in my family at the moment, 

I live on an obscure little island near the UK. we have a local quiz show that’s aired on the telly that I appeared on a few years ago. 

The premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. Some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. I sailed through a lot of the physical part because I wasn’t a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so I was ok there.

As for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box ‘room’ filled with something you’re terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. 

I thought of a believable lie before I entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and I put down all the things I’m *not* scared of. I listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. I literally couldn’t care less about any of these creatures. I grew up in rural landscape and I’ve had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it’s not an issue. My actual fear is a bit more obscure and I really honestly knew I’d fail if I was put in a room with it. 

When I entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* I was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross I can’t lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.

I did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. The rest of the contestants failed.

Now, I won a pretty average car which I didn’t particularly want, so as soon as I legally could I sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.

I told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think I cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.

Anyway, I was on register the other day, taking people's orders. Two older men were ordering from me. One of them said ""a coffee, black"", so I just asked to clarify the size he wanted and the roast (blonde, medium or dark) to which he first spoke to his friend and said, rudely

""Nou zeg, niet de slimste meid die hier werkt, hè? Ze zouden en beetje kunnen leeren om hun hersenen te gebruiken""

Which is Dutch and translates roughly to 

""Wow, (this is) not the smartest gal that works here, huh? They could learn to use their brains a little""

Then he told me he wanted a medium dark roast. So I nodded and then replied to him in Dutch, asking him the regular questions I would to complete an order (anything else to eat or drink today?, What was your name for your other drinks? Do you have a Starbucks rewards card?). I was perfectly pleasant and smiley for the rest of the transaction but just conducted it in Dutch. 

He answered the questions in English but his eyes were bulging out of his head. His friend looked kind of worried but burst out laughing when they walked away.

I realize it might not be the best look for someone in service, and when my coworker asked me what it was about and I explained, she seemed kinda confused as to why I would do that.

I don't think it was an asshole move because I was still nice to the guy but I definitely called him out and made it clear to him that I'd understood the stuff he was saying. But maybe I shouldn't have because of the position I was in at the time (like customer service?)

AITA for spiking my leftovers with Ghost Pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson,29144,Not the A-hole,1277,cavukv,1562674667.0,"So my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. After several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. A few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. I wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing I'd eat it the next day. 

Since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. I got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. I open the fridge grab MY BOX and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. I know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so I knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

I'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. Knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon I decided to sprinkle Ghost Pepper flakes on the last two slices. We actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. So I'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. This fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. After he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and I get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk.

I have a car that I bought with money I'd saved from work, and I pay my own gas. However my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.

They said I need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. And the problem is that I get motion sick easily; even when I'm driving. Too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when I'm in a car make me feel ill too.

I'm not exaggerating, I've always been like this. As a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. I always make sure I know where my barf bag is on a plane. I always used to take motion sickness pills, but I'm not allowed when I'm driving because they make you tired.

Anyway, I can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me I literally feel so sick because of his BO. Even with the windows on my side open

My friend told me I should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. 

Right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.

So I did that and told my mom and dad that I couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine; I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.

And that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.

So I was hanging out with some friends. Two guys, one woman. We're all in our early 20s and have had our fair share of romance in life. The topic of sex popped up and we start talking about some of our past experiences. One guy joked about how having sex only made his dick bigger and bigger. We all laughed and he said that he wished that's how it works. My female friend (let's call her Sarah) piped up and said ""Yeah, for women, it's the complete opposite. The more sex you have, the bigger your labia gets and the looser you become."" There were some chuckles, but then I asked her if she was serious. She said she was.

Now, this is a big myth. I was surprised a woman who has had some experience actually believes that. I basically told her this, and then she started getting annoyed, asking ""how me and my dick knows about that"". I said the same way I know anything about female anatomy- I've read up on it. The whole ""women get looser"" thing is something sexist dudes made up to slut-shame women. My other friends were silent on this.

His mother surrendered her rights and is no longer in the picture. I work 4am-12pm at a gas station and I raise my son, that's what I do these days. Only one of my friends still speaks to me and hangs out with me. I live at home with my parents and sister (21) and pay a small rent each month. I can't afford to move out with the baby. My parents help me when they can. My sister doesn't like my son, she once told me she thinks he's an annoyance and hinderance. If he cries she complains. If there's baby clothes in the laundry she complains. Basically the baby exists and that pisses her off. I'm not perfect but I'm trying my best to be a good dad. My sister has never offered to help with the baby beyond holding him briefly and she hasn't done that more than about four or five times since he was born.

The other day my friend called and offered me a really great opportunity for some side-work. He works construction and they needed an extra guy for some installation work. Four hours and I'd get $400.00. I jumped at it, any extra money can only help. I started trying to find a babysitter. My sister was hanging out in the living room while I walked around the house on the phone. I managed to find a sitter who said she didn't want to be paid and went to get the baby ready. My sister asked me why I didn't ask her when she was sitting right there. I told her I didn't think she'd want to since she'd never offered to help before. She told me it was different, this was for work and not just me wanting to sleep or whatever, and he was about to go down for his nap and he's pretty easy when first wakes up, she told me it wouldn't be a problem.

I asked her why she didn't say something between phone calls and she said she didn't think she needed too because we're family and family asks each other for help. I reminded her of all the times she'd complained about the baby and me and called him names and told me she waited he'd never been born and asked her why she thought I'd ever trust her with my son. She started crying and told me that wasn't fair and I needed to remember that the whole house was dealing with a baby and she was just having a hard time adjusting but she'd never do anything to hurt him. I told her she should have spoken to me about her feelings instead of acting like a child, took my son and left.

I was extremely angry and phoned my sister to tell her to take it down/ post the unedited photo, she refused telling me that she just wanted to show the world what a beautiful girl my daughter was and that she promotes health.

My daughter is trying to lose weight, it isn’t her fault *and* she’s a beautiful, growing girl! My sister has crushed her.

AITA for bringing my garden with me when I moved?,29029,Not the A-hole,2534,hbdi4l,1592511437.0,"I F(25) have been renting a house since I was 18 (7 years). When I moved in, the backyard was a large piece of dirt, no lawn or anything, just a decently big backyard with a fence all around. It was a cheap but not great house, but I signed because I wanted the backyard space. 

Over the past few years I erected a small garden shed, greenhouse and pizza oven (transportables), planted lots of veggie gardens in big transportable garden beds, and put down some nice pavers, an aquaponics set up, and generally made the backyard a really green and beautiful place to be. It became the green oasis all my friends gathered at. 

A few months ago, my landlords let me know they were planning to sell, and my final move out day was a week ago. When I left, I brought my garden with me to my new place - nothing in my last backyard was directly planed into the ground, and nothing permanent. I dismantled the sheds and greenhouse, loaded up all the pots and garden beds onto a truck and cleared the backyard in three days with lots of help. 

My former landlords are furious over this, and demand that I return the backyard to the former state - apparently they’d listed the house for sale with pictures of the backyard and potential buyers were walking away from the house when they saw the barren backyard. They’re accusing me of stealing their plants, and wrecking the backyard.

Legally I’m fine - my contract said I could garden, and I have photos from the first real estate walkthrough before I moved in that show that the backyard was in the same state as I first found it (although with more fertile soil now probably). The same real estate agent signed off my final inspection, and I got my deposit back. 

I’ve received mixed responses though, because I saw the landlords taking pictures of my backyard before I left but didn’t make the connection because imho when pictures of a house has furniture in it, you don’t expect to also get free furniture. Some of my coworkers suggested that IATA because the house valuation certainly has fallen dramatically because I didn’t tell them I was taking my garden with me, so they couldn’t plan to landscape before lockdown hit.

"AITA for insisting if I can't have my partner over, neither can anyone else?",28887,Not the A-hole,3217,degzhj,1570468608.0,"Throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. 

So I [20m] live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend [23f], a guy from my uni course [20m] and his cousin [26f]. For the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. However this has been a real point of contention lately. 

About six months ago I began a relationship with a guy I've known for a couple of years [21m]. I know it's still a fairly new relationship but I really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. Up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. This was mostly due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. Instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch TV and get takeout or cook together. I didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10PM because of his work schedule. 

So the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that I need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". I asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". I pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. She said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". Note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. I confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. I asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. I pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.

My potential assholery: I've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  If I answer the door to anyone's partner I'll send them away. If I come home and someone's partner is there I'll make a point to mention that I thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. I've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. Everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me I'm being unreasonable. I know I'm being petty, but I think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and I'm trying to make that point. Am I really the asshole here?

ETA: some questions people keep asking: 
1. If I knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something I'd have included it. I'm not aware of anything he does and when I ask why 26f doesn't like him I just get a shrug and ""just do"". I will also state I'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners I've had. 
2. We don't hang out in the living room much. We literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that I can't get on my bedroom TV and there's nobody else in there. We use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 
3. A lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26F, *not* my best friend. My best friend is 23F. Not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago I was moving out of halls at university and 23F was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. At the same time, a dude from my course - 20M - was looking for a flatshare. We couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26F - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. I only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.

My husband and I are on our honeymoon. His parents gifted us a week in an all inclusive hotel at no cost to us as a wedding gift, and we were really grateful. On arriving we found out that they'd also booked a room at this hotel for themselves for the whole week and want to do group things. Outside of this, we see them maybe 2 or 3 times a year for a couple days at a time as he finds them a bit overbearing at times and they don't really like me.

It's not like they're in the room next door or anything and we can still do stuff in our room alone but they knock on our door regularly, waking us up at 6am, making us get all 3 meals a day with them. We've tried telling them we wanted ""alone time"" for our honeymoon and they shrugged us off saying that's what our room is for. We also tried faking illness to get out of eating with them and they just got room service to our room and sat with us while we faked stomach aches. My husband snapped earlier and said this whole thing was way over the line and they had no right intruding on our honeymoon of all things, and they told us that they paid for this whole thing and that as adults we're allowed to take holidays at the same time to the same place.

We've been talking and we saved up to pay for our own honeymoon before they surprised us. We still have the money we would have spent in our joint wedding/honeymoon account. There's another town we wanted to go to on our honeymoon and we looked it up and we could get tickets from here to there and then back home for less than £60 total. We could also book a few days in a nice hotel for about half of what's left in our wedding/honeymoon fund and use the remainder of the week we booked off in another town without his parents knowing we'd left until we had.

It's 9pm now, there's trains from here to the other town every hour, plus more half-hourly trains tomorrow.

Would we be the arseholes if we ran away from his parents without telling them?

Long story short, my family(35m, 12m, 10m) and I(32f) just recently moved into a new apartment complex. Our unit is at the very back of the building, at the back of the property, so behind us is just a wooded area, nobody lives there. At the very back of our unit and the one across from ours is a small balcony that faces out towards this wooded area. Because it the way the building is constructed, you can’t see onto another persons balcony unless you go to the stairs and lean over the railing - otherwise the wall blocks you.

Across from our unit is a family of four - a young looking mother, her husband, and their two children who are both under the age of two. I haven’t had the chance to go introduce myself because I think one of their babies is a newborn, and honestly mama seems exhausted. Anyway, a couple of nights ago, I made a horrific discovery. Went outside to call the boys in for dinner and found them both with their upper bodies flung over the railing, staring into our neighbors balcony. I grab both by their pants and ask them just what they think they’re doing, and that’s when I see it. From their vantage point, they could see straight into the neighbor lady’s balcony, where she was sat completely topless, with underwear on listening to headphones. 

I. Was. Livid. Not with her, but with the boys. The way I see it, she’s on her own personal property, where no one is SUPPOSED to be able to see, and not drawing any attention to herself. Plus, if she’s breastfeeding, I get not having a top or bra on. It’s tedious to remove every few hours and for every feeding in between. And who wears pants in their own house? Anyway, I digress. I pulled the boys in the house and took away their video games and phones until further notice, and told my husband immediately when he got home. But surprisingly, HE was mad at ME! Saying boys would be boys and the lady should have some decency to wear clothes outside, and asked me to speak to her about it.

As punishment my parents took away a lot of my things; all my clothes except 3 pairs of plain jeans and 3 plain black shirts and my coat. And all my makeup and hair stuff, purses and shoes; saying I had to earn things back with good behavior, I don't get to engage in my hobby (fashion) till I've earned it.

Anyway it was a shitty couple months but I came to a couple realizations.

It was actually kind of nice to not have to think about what to wear and how I look.  My friends knew what my parents had done and didn't judge me. I also told anyone who asked why I looked like I only had one outfit what was up and it was no big deal.

I know it was supposed to be a demeaning humiliating punishment to make me look bad at school but honestly it just makes them look bad when people at school know I'm only allowed to wear one thing.

I don't want to have things that are just something someone else can hold over my head. I don't want the old clothes and makeup back, if I'm gonna get back into that stuff I'll do it on my own terms; I'll buy my own stuff.

I work way longer hours than her in a much more physically demanding profession (I'm a plumber, she's an engineer) so I think we're putting an equal amount of effort into this baby. 

And it's not like I don't help around the house, either. She does all the cooking and dishes, but I do laundry, take out garbage, and mow the lawn (we pay someone to do the floors and bathrooms weekly). My MIL comes over to help with the kids because she says I'm useless (ive been meaning to make a justnomil post about her), and while I appreciate the help I'm sick of her crap. Just because I want one hour of video games to myself a day instead of cleaning up messes in the kitchen doesn't mean I'm ""useless"". 

This all came to head yesterday when my wife screamed at me from the kitchen to get off my ass and entertain our twins so she could focus on her meatloaf. I made a dumb joke about how this is the third meatloaf we'll be eating this week, and she. lost. her. shit. She told me how I have no sympathy for the fact that she's pregnant, I should be taking on more of her chores since I can't breastfeed, but then I reminded her that I still work a lot more hours than her, so I think we're basically both pregnant.

She got really quiet, and has only spoken to me regarding the kids since. I don't think I'm wrong but I'll apologize to her if it makes her happy. AITA here?

Edit: my wife does get breaks, guys. I set up the annoying foot bath thing every night while she does dishes and then she relaxes with it while watching YouTube every night while I put the kids to bed. She also won't eat my cooking because she grew up in southeast Asia and doesn't like American food. It's not my fault she's picky.


Edit 2: it's a Korean BBQ meatloaf she makes since some people pointed out meatloaf is typically American. Anyway, my wife found this post and now she wants us to do couples counseling. Thanks for the feedback, guys.",True,1588715575.0,2020-05-05 18:49:48
AITA for cutting up and altering my wedding dress into a functional dress instead of giving it to my sister who can't afford an expensive dress?,28586,Not the A-hole,2564,erfvwt,1579568209.0,"I need an unbiased opinion on this because I don't know if i was the asshole.

Throwaway because I am active in other communities and I don't want this to mix.

So I was supposed to get married 2 moths ago to my ex partner of 5 years. Sadly we broke it off because he cheated on me on his bachelor party with a striper.

I had this beautiful dress that cost me arround 2k dollars (out of my pocket). I had been very depressed since everything happened because I felt it was somehow my fault for not being sexy enough or not giving him what he wanted. So last weekend I decided to ""take my power back"" and I began altering the dress. I have been sewing for 15 plus years so I know what I am doing. I cut it a bit, changed the color to something less wedding-y and after a week of work I had a beautiful gown that I could use for more stuff.

The problem comes now. I uploaded that picture of the dress to Instagram with a caption that said something along the lines of "" you can change the worst memories"" or some shit like that.

My sister hits me up and asks me if that was my old wedding dress and I told her yes. She then called me and asked me why I had done this. I asked her why it was such a big deal. And she told me that I could have waited till after he wedding. I was so confused. Then she reminded me that when we were staying at the hotel where my wedding was supposed to happen my mom and sister where there cheering me up and my sister said something along the lines of ""oh well if you are not using it i will"". We all laughed so I thought it was a joke because it was never brought up again after. She just asked me once what material it was so I assumed she wanted something similar.

Now my sister is mad at me and my mom says she understands our povs. But that I could have waited 5 more moths till after her wedding to ""take my power back""

AITA?

Edit : yes he fucked the stripper please stop asking me

Edit2: what the fuck is wrong with some of you. Suddenly I am the asshole for leaving my ex for cheating on me because it doesn't count because it was his bachelor party?

AITA for proving to my roommate that her boyfriend keeps hitting on me?,28567,Not the A-hole,1688,flvmtn,1584742210.0,"I’m Sam, my roommates name is Lauren, and her boyfriends name is Mark. 

Lauren and Mark have been dating for maybe four months. Mark always hits on me. Like always. As soon as Lauren walks away, Mark is laying it on thick with compliments, and asking when our lease is up. 

I wear a lot of body-con and sometimes low cut clothing , so I expect to get glances maybe mild staring. But this guy is very obviously hitting on me, and often times in ways that make me uncomfortable, especially since he is always at our apartment. 
 
I have told Lauren several times that Mark hits on me, and she just rolls her eyes. She doesn’t believe me, which is confusing to me. Lauren and I have been roommates for five years. In that time she has dated three other guys, and I have never complained about this before. 

So yesterday she tells me that Mark is coming over. I was like, great, I told her if she would just walk upstairs in our apartment building, and tell Mark that she was going around the block, she would walk in and see him hitting on me. She actually agreed to do it to “humor” me. 

Mark gets to the apartment, and I am just doing the dishes, I tell him that Lauren went to the store up the block, but she is really right outside the door. 

He sits at the counter and starts chatting with me normally, then the conversation turns to him hitting on me. Normally I just walk away from Mark, but I endured it so that Lauren would see/hear.

She came in and told Mark to go to her room. Then she then she starts yelling at *ME*. Saying I saying I tried to seduce him and that I dressed like a slut. And I’m like “I *always* dress like a slut Lauren! Who cares! Your boyfriend is hitting on me!”
We argued and both said some shitty stuff to each other. 

She and Mark are staying in her bedroom and we haven’t spoken to each other since. As I’m thinking about it, I’m wondering if I am an asshole for even trying to do this but at the same time I think she sucks for not believing me in the first place. 

I live in New York. I love my neighborhood I don’t want to have to find a new roommate because of this idiot. If I did an asshole thing please tell me. AITA",False,False,2020-03-20 15:10:10
WIBTA if I told a close family friend that her husband cheated on her 4 years ago?,28391,Asshole,6111,cvlkut,1566839569.0,"So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we’re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven’t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what’s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the “secrets” I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying “Just don’t let mom find out” The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out “I cheated on my wife...” At first it didn’t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife’s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They’ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) 
He told me life has been good to him now and he’s just thankful things have finally worked out. 

As stated before I hate cheaters and I’ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it’s the right thing to do, especially because I’ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it’s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don’t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don’t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?

TLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she’s a close friend. WIBTA?

Edit: I’m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong.

AITA for telling my son that if he changes his last name then I’m no longer his Father?,28377,Not the A-hole,4419,d9fawt,1569504692.0,"Let me start off by saying my son, Adam, is 22 years old. Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we’d adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn’t find out until 20 years later. 

Tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he’s not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. 

He’s an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It’s been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he’s busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it’s been completely different since he found out about Chris.

I couldn’t stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn’t matter. Any time we’d actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I’d ask him how classes or friends were and he’d just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn’t even mention it to me until a year later. 

I told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he’d do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.

What was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris’ because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I told him this “I can’t believe you are going to do this. That’s really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I’m no longer your Father and I don’t want to be involved in your life.” 

He hung up on me. I didn’t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn’t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he’s 22).

My family told me I’m being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it’s reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?

INFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn’t speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn’t contact me. I didn’t contact them. I needed a break.

Edit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he’s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. 

I never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

I told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son’s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this “Adam, you haven’t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn’t sit well with me. That’s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I’m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.” Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

He was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex’s affair. I don’t know if that’s the real reason he’s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",True,1569530215.0,2019-09-26 06:31:32

"AITA for telling my ""nephew"" his ps4 was going to be destroyed to teach him a lesson?",28353,Not the A-hole,2422,ek4u98,1578211320.0,"Ok. I fucked up.

My brother-in-law saw one of those stupid videos where they destroy the video game console in front of the child to teach him a lesson. I heard him planning on doing that to my nephew because he failed 2 courses at school (he is 12). I tried talking them out of it, telling them that's not the way, sell it, hide it, whatever just don't do it.... that was my point.

I told my nephew, what they were going to do, and asked him not to overreact, just tell them you are disappointed, or something that makes them feel bad, if he brings his grades up, I will get him a new PS4, but I want his stupid parents to feel guilty.

Last week, my brother-in-law sat him a chair, have a couple of assholes friends holding him and proceed to destroy the ps4 with a baseball bat, while laughing and yelling and recording.

My nephew had a poker face, did not move at all,  and whisper something and laughed. His dad stopped asked everybody to shut up and asked him, what? why are you laughing about?

My nephew said: You humiliated me, you took something that was mine, and humiliated me in front of everybody.  You are bigger, stronger... but everybody is helpless when they are asleep. I am laughing because everybody is helpless when they are sleeping.... If you are done, I want to go inside, there something I need to think about.

He had an entire week to prepare what to say, and this is what he came up with, and his delivery was fucking scary, I was speechless, everybody was shocked. I said out loud, good parenting everybody, good job, and went after my nephew.

I spoke with my nephew afterward,  and he said that he will tell no one I had told him, and he has no plans on doing anything to his parents at all, he just wants to teach him a lesson as I suggested.

Now, my sister book an appointment with a psychologist, they are sleeping with locks on their doors and caused a family crisis.

And I feel like an asshole because I just have to tell them what I did to patch things, but honestly, I just want to see where this is going.

&#x200B;

Edit.

I tried to answer as many comments as possible but I will provide some more context.

1. My nephew told me he heard a similar line in a mafia movie, but he doesn't remember which, he told he wrote down some ideas to make the parents feel guilty and chose that one.
2. it did happen. I am aware of how unbelievably bad-ass it sound. I share it because I was feeling guilty and because I was proud of my nephew's epic response.
3. The father tried hiding the controller once to punish him, but he sneak a second controller he borrowed from a friend. They are not abusive parents all the time. They saw a video online, thought it will teach him a lesson. I disagree and thought it was outright traumatic since they didn't listen I thought to give my nephew a heads up.
4. My sister is super paranoic. Her husband is concerned about his response, but not because he is afraid for his life. My sister is. Which makes things worse for me.
5. I thought it was a fun thing to share, they are not bad people, they do weird stuff like taking pictures of my nephews and niece holding signs when they do something wrong (shame pictures), nothing physical, nothing really abusive, this was the first and for the looks the last time.
6. I don't think there is much to update, they will go to therapy and most likely will patch things out. If something worth sharing or worthy of talking about, I will post it.
7. yes, I feel very proud of my nephew. keeping it cool while it was happening it was way more than what I could have possibly expected.

Edit 2

In retrospective and after reading some comments, they really need therapy. When you see it every day it is hard to notice that some behavior could be toxic. I don't regret what I did, and definitely don't regret posting it here. Reddit can be really insightful sometimes.

"AITA for getting my family to do a ""swear tax"" after my dad told me off for swearing? (My dad and brothers cuss like sailors but apparently me cussing is unladylike?)",28296,Not the A-hole,1017,hfr4xe,1593137824.0,"I am living with my family, it's me a 15 year old girl, my twin brothers who are 17, and my parents.

My dad cusses a lot, and so do my older brothers. But apparently the standards are different for me, my dad overheard me saying a couple cuss words when I was on the phone with my friends and he got mad at me for my language, and for how trashy and unladylike it was.

This wasn't the first time he called me (and only me) out for bad language, but it was the one that frustrated me the most because I could tell there was a double standard.

I thought of calling him out on his language and hipocracy, but then I had a different idea.

---

I said that yeah, it was a bad habit I was forming and didn't want to make a pattern... because if I got in the habit of cussing a lot, that wouldn't make me come off well when I start getting jobs or going to college. And as I was growing up, I wanted to learn how to speak respectfully and intelligently.

But it was hard to keep from bad habits, when I heard him and my brothers having potty-mouth-syndrome so often. They're setting an example whether they realize it or not... So I wanted to work on things for myself, but also together as a family. 

I suggested we make a ""Swear Tax"" where if anyone swears in front of anyone else who's participating, they give a dollar to each person who heard them. I'd want that rule for myself because it would keep me accountable and I'd really like it if the family joined me for it...

----

So my dad said he'd join, and so would my mom. They got my brothers to be a part of it too. They didn't really have a choice, my parents decided to make it a rule.

I know it's kinda petty but I wanted to make the point that my dad and brothers swear a lot and I almost never do. 

In the few months we've had the rule, I've gotten about 250 dollars from hearing my dad and brothers cuss, and have not sworn once. It's kinda making my brothers angry because they often cuss when they're mad, and I ask them for money, so they get madder and cuss more, so I get more money until they shut up.

My dad actually got mad at me too, he was having some drinks, calling his brother and talking, and I came over after and asked for 18 dollars. He actually said he wouldn't give me that much, and there should be a cutoff. He gave me 5 dollars which sends a weird message... Like swearing is bad, unless you wanna swear A LOT, then it's cool??

I feel like I've made my point already so really now I'm just continuing to ""want the family to learn not to cuss"" for the money, and it's really making my brothers mad.

AITA for asking my cousin not to bring his autistic son (my nephew) to my home any more because of a romantic attachment to my wife?,28142,No A-holes here,2741,cs6k42,1566188652.0,"I know from the title, it definitely sounds like I would be the asshole but please hear me out. I have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. My nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (I don’t know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. 

Recently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we’ve hosted them in the past when they’ve visited. The first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. He drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. He told her no, she was his girlfriend. 

This weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. His mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn’t pay attention to him as much as before. He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. I stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. 

Once they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. Here’s the part where I may be the asshole. I told my cousins I didn’t feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and I know for sure she didn’t, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. I told them I couldn’t allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. They didn’t say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. 

I guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that I should’ve been more understanding and that I was wrong to ask them to leave. 

Am I the asshole?

EDIT for added info: 

Thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. There’s not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when I saw how many had reached out to me), but I wanted to address some questions that had been asked. 

1. The first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. My dad is an only child so the cousin I refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad’s first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). I’m not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). The reason I refer to him as my nephew is because he’s the generation after mine in our family tree and it’s less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. A lot of people have posted that it’s not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, I don’t care, and my family’s never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. I apologize if it was misleading in my post. Without being specific, in the western state I was born and grew up in, it’s not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. I call him my nephew because my cousin and I were close and I still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though I don’t know how after this situation). 

2. Some have asked if I was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. The first time, I thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. Remember, in my mind he’s my nephew and I never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. Regarding the situation that happened this weekend, I was only concerned for my wife and son’s safety. I didn’t know how he would react and followed my cousin’s lead, but wasn’t about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. 

3. I don’t know what was said to my paternal grandmother but I don’t want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we’ve both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",False,1566790701.0,2019-08-18 21:24:12
AITA for telling my sister to get over her daughter's achievements?,28113,Not enough info,1749,dpn1e5,1572554859.0,"I am one of five children, and we all have grown up/late teen children. They're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. 

My sister Paula's daughter Amy is the most successful of the bunch. She's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.

I don't dislike Amy but she's always been trouble. I have a daughter the same age as her, Charlotte. When they were younger Amy did a great job convincing Charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as Amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. 

When Amy graduated, Paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and Amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then Paula has gone out of her way to make Amy the centre of attention everywhere. Over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. Amy wanted to go too and Paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from X''. Amy behaved like a brat the entire time and Paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. 

Amy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. I don't mind this but they do, but once again Paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. 

The final straw came last weekend. My son Mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. Paula, her husband Rob, and Amy were there, and Paula set about trying to convince me to let Amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. Mark's fiancee Vicky barely knows Amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. Paula said Amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. 

I was frustrated and told Paula that Amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. I told Paula Amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. 

Unfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. Amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying I was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public.

AITA for not wanting my dad to “walk” me down the aisle because he’s in a wheelchair?,28151,Asshole,1216,gxrgku,1591480690.0,"About three years ago my dad was injured in a really bad hit and run car accident. He broke just about every bone in his body, and left him paralysed from the waist down. Our relationship has always been really good, but I hate seeing him in pain and admittedly try to avoid seeing him because it just makes me uncomfortable. 

In November I’m getting married. I’ve been with my fiancé for 4 years and he and my dad get on really well. Naturally the discussion of who was going to give me away came up in the family group chat, and I kept silent after I realised my dad would be in a wheelchair. We always talked about him giving me away and having a dance at my wedding and I don’t want to be reminded of what could’ve been at my wedding. I messaged my mom privately and told her I want my uncle to walk me down the aisle as we’re incredibly close. 

She naturally asked why and I told her that my dad being in a wheelchair would add complications to the wedding. The walkway would have to be widened to accommodate his wheelchair and he wouldn’t be able to hold my arm or give me a proper hug. She was outraged, called me an ableist POS and removed me from the group chat. My aunt has since called me telling me my dad is absolutely devastated. AITA?

Update - I appreciate all the people who have messaged me offering me support, your kind words have meant a lot to me whilst rifling through a bunch of messages telling me to do horrible things to myself. Regardless of what you think of me, telling me these things isn’t okay. I’m going to call my dad tomorrow

Update 2 - can people please stop messaging me such horrendous stuff? think about what you’re saying. You may not agree with me or my life but you’re just as bad as I apparently am if you’re going round saying stuff like that to strangers on the internet

UPDATE - Not that I owe it to anyone but I thought I’d give you all an update. My boyfriend and I have decided to part ways and ive apologised to my dad",True,1591911580.0,2020-06-06 14:58:10
"AITA for using money we ""earmarked"" for our 6 month old's college fund to buy back the exact 1972 Ford Bronco I owned as a teenager?",28054,Asshole,6357,ci5zhq,1564191775.0,"So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing. 

When I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

We had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. 

Two weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO! 

I asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is. 

My wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

Like I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it?

Edit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she’s going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She’s always been awesome to me and she’s rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the “mommy bailed you out” comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it’s coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it’s not like I’m not paying for it on my own eventually.

Edit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ?

Edit4: I’m getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I’m still reading because honestly I’m afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

Edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you’re a mod, do you know? I can’t respond to any posts and get the “status 403” whenever I try. Thanks!

Edit in the morning: I couldn’t figure out why I was getting so many private’s  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn’t tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I’ll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I “had come to your senses” I don’t want to disappoint her.

About six months or so ago my grandpa died. For simplicity sake, let’s say hi estate is worth about $1.5 million. In his will he said that me, my sister and my cousin each get 1/3 share.  His estate was basically two cash amounts and the other share was his beach home in California. Basically the oldest got to pick which they wanted, the second oldest and the youngest which was me. M

I got the beach house, my sister and cousin got $500k. For the last six months I’ve allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but I just got my first tax bill and I either have to sell it or start making some income off it. After talking to the real estate agent I’ve decided the best course of action is to put it on Airbnb. That way I can still use it if I like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there’s not someone renting full-time.

 My sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all I know she’s upset because she can no longer use the house for free. But she’s also telling me that I basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. She has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. She also says it’s not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but I still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house I could stay there any time I want.

AITA for being honest with my nephew about where I was for most of his life?,27901,Not the A-hole,2202,cgq9zs,1563902249.0,"Okay, let me just get right into this. I [27M] was kicked out at 16 because my older sister [37F] outed me to my parents as gay. They completely cut off all contact with me and I didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and Mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. When I was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. For the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

A couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and I ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

I got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". I explained to her that I didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and I think he's old enough to deserve honesty. She just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. I'm crushed because obviously I love the kid.

WIBTA If I posted a video montage online of my neighbor throwing things in my yard?,27898,Not the A-hole,1364,ekglhk,1578276608.0,"My mom and I bought a duplex for me to manage and live in during my years in college. Bought the house in 2018, I moved in the summer of 2019. We installed a ring video security system, along with a front yard doorbell and backyard video floodlights.

When I moved in, there were a ton of branches and limbs by my neighbors fence. That was odd since we only had one medium-sized tree, nearly ten feet from the fence.

Later that summer, the backyard ring camera caught the neighbor throwing branches over. We realized that that is where the huge pile came from.

Halloween came around and my roommate and I decided to throw a party on Friday, November 1st. We tried to talk to Ms. Stick thrower, but they were not home during our three attempts. We left a note explaining it, along with our names and numbers.

The party was 30+ people coming and going, along with music and a beerpong table in the backyard. Cops were (rightfully) called at 11:45PM; we shut it down.

The 4th, I was in class and got a front doorbell notification. It was Ms. Stick thrower pulling up my decorative styrofoam tombstones and throwing them behind my bushes. When I got home I saw that one was broken. 

My roommate and I decided to call the non-emergency line about this, because obviously she had no respect for us, and this is the south so anyone could have a gun.

A cop came out, we showed her everything, and we went to talk to the neighbor. Her fiancee opened the door, claimed she was not home despite her car being there.

Anyways, time went on and I noticed that she came into our backyard via a gate, which was deep in my backyard. This freaked me out, as video showed her smoking and wandering around my backyard. I put a carabiner on the gate to keep her out.

End of November, I come home and see these huge limbs flying over the fence. I get out, confront her, we argue, and she claims that she owns two feet of my backyard. She ends the conversation with ""Do you want to make these next four years a living hell?"" 

Called the non-emergency number, and once again she hid from the cops. I found out that she is a professor at my university. 

I emailed the dean of students, told him everything and provided proof. Their resources were useless, and I am beyond fed up. Cops say they can't do anything, despite video evidence and four no trespassing signs. I want her to stop.

We got a survey done, and she does NOT own two feet into my backyard.

I have edited together a video montage of her throwing limbs, branches, sticks, rocks, and cigarettes together, along with her trespassing in my backyard.

WIBTA if I posted this video online with the caption ""University Professor's Actions""?

Edit: I have spoken to my mom and we just sent an email, entailing all the details plus video, to her Dean. Also, I posted to legal advice.

Edit: Wow, okay, really did not expect this to get so much traction. I appreciate everyone's advice, and I plan on making many calls tomorrow. The Dean's office reopens tomorrow as well, so I might hear back from them then. Not sure whats going on with my legal post, I'll try to fix it. There is also NO TREES/BRANCHES HANGING OVER THE FENCE. She is throwing branches from her yard into mine. In the beginning, I threw the branches back over, but they would magically appear with even more. So I gave up.

So Amy is getting married,  she has a blue and green and purple theme for the wedding. 
People are supposed to wear these colours including the moh and the bridesmaids. 
What irked me about that post was that my hair is NOT FLAMING MERIDA RED.
maybe slightly more [ginger] (https://ibb.co/w4yrCCk) in low light
This whole thing is completely insane to me and I have no idea where it has come from.

My [hair](https://ibb.co/y4dKsCZ) [2]
(https://ibb.co/3BVPgBf) [3](https://ibb.co/MD1V7NH) is what i would describe as strawberry blonde, maybe ginger blonde. 
Those are actual picture's of my hair not some poor stranger's instagram.
Things have been awkward from the start with Amy demanding that everyone has to stick to this dress code or they will be barred by security at the damn door.
She has also asked anyone with hair past their waist to cut it in a Facebook post but it got no replies and I can't think of anyone except me and maybe my sister with suoer long hair.
My mum and dad are both way more ginger than me and my sister who is 8 months pregnants hair is not much shorter than mine and is super ginger, and Amy never asked her to touch her hair? if anything I got the dull hair geane.

At first Amy called up to tell me she had made a post here,  I took a look and had to laugh to be honest,  She linked me early on clealry thinking people would agree with her but she said she was worried because it blew up. 

After things went south she decided to try and ""negotiate"" with me, still completely bizzare as my hair is not merida red.
My mum and dad called round a few days back to talk about it but got absolutely nowhere with her as she's still insisting i dye my hair a dark brown for the day or get a wig. 

My aunt,  Amy's mom called to apologise to me and asked me to please come but I don't feel welcome, can you imagine attending a wedding where the bride stares daggers at you the whole time? and what if the security refuse to let me in. 
[these](https://www.frenchnovelty.com/sean-couture-peacock-corset-back-ball-gown-prom-dress-70567) are extremely similar to the gowns the bridesmaids are going to wear, I've tired mine on and it absolutely dose not clash at all.
I brought and paid for my dress so I don't owe her anything but our families are so upset that I'm dropping out. 
But if I go I have no choice except to dye my hair as there never was a compromise or middle ground,  it was dye it,  buy a short brown bob wig or don't come. 
She specified it has to be a short brown bob wig for some reason.

   Last night, after my mom told me to but J+A(3) to bed, I told her to do it herself as I need to study. She said that it is my responsibility as an older child.

UPDATE: AITA for kicking a girl out of my bridal party because of how sensitive she was being towards my ideas for dresses?,27672,UPDATE,290,euwsvi,1580197419.0,"So I had an overwhelming response to my post about asking if I was TA for kicking a girl out of my bridal party for being sensitive about dresses, and I got a lot of NTA/ESH, and I could see both sides, understood that I could have handled it better, and I was glad to see that a lot of people also believed that Joy was being “a lot to handle”. Anyways, I decided to take your advice, and here’s an update on the situation, for anyone that’s interested!

So after reading a ton of your comments, I decided to call Joy and invite her over to talk. Luckily, she said yes (by the way, before this, she didn’t say she didn’t want to be at my wedding, so she was still planning on becoming a guest), and I apologized for kicking her out with no warning, but I laid out my frustrations. She apologized for being really picky about the dress and realized that the attention wasn’t going to be on her and it wasn’t her day, so it wasn’t really appropriate for her to get upset over fine details on a dress. She also revealed to me that this was going to be her first time being a bridesmaid (she doesn’t usually wear dresses, she’s more of a leggings and sweatshirt type of girl). I took some of your guys’ advice again and asked Joy to show me a couple of dresses online she would be comfortable with (didn’t matter what color, I just wanted to see her style), and she searched for about 10 minutes and couldn’t find one that she “loved”. She kind of looked bummed and a little apologetic, so I came up with a plan. The official dress shopping day for the bridesmaids was the next day, and I invited Joy to go with us, to get a feel for the dresses, to see if she would be comfortable. She agreed.

So the next day, my girls and I met up at a dress place, tried on a couple of dresses, and Joy didn’t really like them, even though my other bridesmaids did. Finally, we tried on the 4th dress, which was THE one. The girls fell in LOVE with it, and I looked at joy and she was staring at herself in the mirror, but she had a smile on her face! :) I came up to her and told her again I didn’t mind if she wore a shawl or cover up for some moments, and she nodded and smiled again. Actually one of my bridesmaids (who didn’t really know about the situation) came up to joy and told her how gorgeous she looked in the dress. I’m not gonna lie, I shed a couple of tears because they all looked so beautiful.

So we found a dress that was matching and all the girls were happy with, and Joy is back in the bridal party. Hope that this was a happy ending that everyone enjoyed :) Now for me, I have to go to plan other parts of the wedding with my fiancé:)

Edit: I couldn’t find the actual dress, but I did find something very similar online.

AITA for kicking my boyfriend's parents out of our apartment after his mom called me a bitch?,27670,Not the A-hole,1776,gon4bm,1590195628.0,"Back in March his parents decided they wanted to come ""wait quarantine out"" at our apartment. For starters they never asked. His mother called and TOLD me that they were on their way and to prepare our spare bedroom for them. I was already apprehensive about them staying with us because his parents have always been EXTREMELY rude to me. They are overly critical of everything I say and do. They are massive control freaks who feel entitled to always be in charge. So right off the bat things are miserable. They verbally abuse me daily, tell me what I can and can't do in my own apartment, and are overall just the WORST. 

Out of everything, the air conditioning caused the biggest debacle. Where I live it has been 85-90 almost every day. I normally keep my air on 70, but when they started complaining, I turned the air up to 75. This is already a little toasty for me, but I was willing to be a little hot to try to keep the peace. This was not good enough for them. They don't want the air on. Period. They want the HEAT on. And they turn it on every single opportunity they get. I wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat. I have told them to stop COUNTLESS times. Yesterday I finally cracked. I put about 10 pieces of duct tape over the thermostat with a note attached that said ""Do NOT touch the thermostat while I am at work"". 6pm I walk into my apartment and am automatically HIT by a hotter and more humid heat than it is OUTSIDE. Duct tape and note have been torn off the thermostat and they have the heat on 98 fucking degrees. 

I go into the guest room and say ""Why could you not follow the simple instruction of DO NOT TOUCH THE THERMOSTAT. This is my home. I am tired of you saying rude things to me. I am tired of you treating me like a child and creating your own rules for MY apartment. You either need to be respectful towards me and learn to accept my boundaries or go back to your own house."" His mother said and I disdainfully quote, ""You have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy but you need to take the attitude out of your tone. I've dealt with much bigger bitches than you before."" She went on for 30 minutes and I just tuned her out. When she was done talking I told her to get out. 

Now my boyfriend is angry with me because I couldn't just let them have their way. He wants me to call his mom and apologize but I don't think I should have to. I may have been rude to her, but it was only because I have spent the past two months dealing with her abuse and trying to politely ask her to stop treating me that way. I got tired of politely asking someone to stop treating me like shit in my own home in which I was letting them live in for free. I also got tired of my boyfriend refusing to defend me and allowing her to say and do whatever she wanted. I am trying to understand their perspective although it just doesn't seem reasonable to me.

I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  

However, despite being a ""supporter,"" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, ""You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that I look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.

These hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. 

Finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""Maybe he's into curvier girls."" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. 

She called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize.

I'm in high school, we had a final presentation before winter break, and we had judges from the community come in to reward the best presentations. Like not actual court room judges, just people who were involved in stuff locally. The prize was some scholarship money for college. 

Our classrooms judge was a mom who in the school board and when we were doing the presentations she was showing really obvious favoritism to her daughter's best friend who i know is tight with that family. I know her presentation wasn't even her own, it was plagarized a lot and not very good, I saw her doing it in the computer lab days earlier.

It was annoying how the ""outside judge""kept going back to coo over this one presentation even after everyone had moved on and other people had presented. It was super awkward, like she was praising this one girl after a different kid had just presented?? Like maybe pay attention to the person who's at the podium, not your little favorite??

It was my turn but I'd already seen her phoning it in when watching the last few, playing on her phone even! Not paying attention. I felt like it was pretty obvious she'd already decided who would would win. And that frustrated me, I'd worked really hard on mine and if her behavior is in the last few presentations was gonna continue, I knew she wouldn't even be listening.

So I went up and said ""Look, we all know you already know who you're gonna give the prize to, we've all seen you play on your phone and ignore everyone who came after your daughters best friend, so can we just cut the crap and go home? I'm not gonna stand up here and give a presentation to someone who's disrespecting our efforts and playing on their phone when anyone who's not a friend of your family is talking.""

She sure paid attention then, and went to talk to my teacher in a whisper. My teacher sent me to the principal's office. 

The girl I expected to win, won... No surprise there. But I felt good I'd at least said something. A bunch of my friends in class said I was totally right when I called out that BS, and we all knew it, I wasn't saying anything we didn't all see.

My principal kept telling me that it didn't seem like I was taking my college apps seriously and I said that I didn't think I'd be going to college, I got stuck with debt already and I'm gonna need a job right away this spring. Anyway I got detention

AITA for saying what I did instead of doing my final presentation for the project?

Edit - I just found out that the girl who got the scholarship money decided to decline it and give it to the student who had the best grade in the class. I don't know if it was because I called stuff out and she felt guilty, but I think it might be.",False,1581187784.0,2020-02-08 13:53:24
AITA for kicking out my dad and his pregnant wife out of the home I legally own after they sent my depressed sister to live with our aunt?,27587,Not the A-hole,1487,fiq5ta,1584251129.0,"My mother passed away 3 years ago. The family home, where I and my sister grew up, was willed to me. It was her ancestral property, and she wanted her daughter to have it. The other vacation home went to my 16 year old sister.

Our father remarried 6 months after mom passed away and moved his new wife in. My sister says that that woman has removed all of our family pictures from the main living area. She has removed our mom's pictures as well. Now all of these pictures adorn the walls of my sister's room.

Recently our father and his wife announced that they were pregnant with twins. My sister didn't take it well. She's still not over mom's death and had a breakdown after the announcement.

The night of my sister's 16th birthday party, she brought a lot of friends over and the party went on till the next morning.

My dad's wife, who was out with our father on vacation returned the same morning and lost her cool when she saw the kids passed out on the living room. Our dad knew about the party, they just got home earlier than expected.

His wife proceeded to lose her cool and had a big shouting match with my sister. She said that my sister was just like our mom and was a burden on our dad. She then asked her to leave and sent her packing to our aunt's.

I was furious when I got to know about it. I showed up home the next day and asked them to leave within a week. She's 7 months pregnant and had no idea that the house belonged to me. I know I shouldn't be kicking a pregnant woman out but I don't want my spineless father and his wife to abuse my sister anymore.

My father called me a cruel brat and now wants to challenge our mom's will. He can try, my mom's family has already appointed their family lawyer to fight my case.

AITA for possibly stealing from a convenience store multiple times and not saying anything about it.,27519,No A-holes here,686,ckndum,1564689328.0,"For the last year I’ve had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. 


About a week ago I went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if I wanted a receipt. At this point I figured I had just used a deal I don’t know about, but the next time I went the same thing happened. So the next several times I’ve gone I’ve made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it’s been free.


I’m thinking something is wrong and I should tell someone, but I kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. AITA?

Update: Hi guys

I thought I had the golden ticket, I really did. 

I thought I had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. The rewards card that wouldn’t stop rewarding. Last night I dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.


I wanted to ask you fine people if I was the asshole real quick before I went balls deep and pilfered my way through a Midwest convenience store chain. I’ll be honest I didn’t care what people said though. I was high on the fact that I had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.


After I made the post I made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, “I mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it’s good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn’t steal”


I made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause I was sleepy. And then I went to perform the maneuver. I strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.

It was a gift card. 


I had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, I found it and my dumb little brain couldn’t read the text that said “gift card” on the bottom.

I’m not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like “alright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82.” But I sucked it up and paid, and now all I have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.

TL;DR I thought I had it all but now I just have a lot of eggs.

AITA for refusing to pay at a restaurant that was false advertising?,27519,Asshole,2773,cblw2u,1562818817.0,"So my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she’s heard good things about. We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I’m hungry. 

I look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I’ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

So anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it’s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter “where’s the rest of my steak?” and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don’t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it’s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it’s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

I’m complaining to my girlfriend and she’s getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I’m a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say. 

When the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that’s where we’re different, I don’t let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

A manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don’t end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald’s and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. It’s now the next day and I’m starting to think I didn’t handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount). My girlfriend hasn’t responded to my texts so now I’m starting to think I’m an asshole.

AITA for telling my niece to stay in the closet until she gets her inheritance?,27531,No A-holes here,2441,hadrc7,1592373424.0,"My (42M) niece (17F) recently confided in me that she is a lesbian.  I supported her, let her know I'd be there, etc.  Usual ally stuff.

However, she told me she was going to come out to the whole world this week.  I let her know she should absolutely wait for her grandparents (my parents) to pass.  My father is incredibly wealthy and has tens of millions of dollars in assets that he will be passing down once he is gone.

My father is a raging homophobe who has flat out stated any gay individual in our family would be written out of the will.  And to make sure the rest of us don't just split more money with said gay relative, they will, instead, have that portion of the inheritance (put aside for that family member) donated to charitable causes.  That money will be erased from the inheritance.

Since both my father and mother are incredibly poor health, (stage 4 cancer and debilitating dementia respectively) I told my niece she should stay in the closet for a while longer.  If she comes out as a lesbian and they find out, she will quite literally lose out on 7 million dollars.

She was a little sad but was also appreciative since that is obviously a life-changing amount of money that will allow her to live luxuriously until she dies.

My wife, however, said that I am being an asshole.  I am telling this poor girl to hide who she is just to appease old bigots.  That is true, I am asking her to appease old bigots.  But I feel like her life quality will be much better with 7 million dollars at the cost of 1-2 years in the closet at tops.

I have also seen my father's will and know who is getting what, so my niece IS definitely going to receive 7 million as long as my father doesn't rewrite or edit his will.

Am I the asshole for telling my niece to stay in the closet so she can be a millionaire?

"AITA for buying a $50,000 guitar for $4,000 and refusing to sell it back when the buyer found out the real value?",27383,Not the A-hole,5863,ftum7d,1585890531.0,"This happened a while back. My wife and I still talk about it every once in a while. She's on my side and most of our friends and family are. However when it happened it was like WW3 between us and her co-workers and others.

Here we go...I've been playing the guitar for 22 years. I know guitar values and whatnot very well. I'm very into the guitar market. At my wife's old company she was hanging out with co-workers one day after work and she mentioned that I play guitar. A co-worker who I guess is very popular at work said that his dad passed away and he was selling his dads things. His dad had a guitar and asked my wife if I'd be interested in it. My wife texted me and I said to have him send me the info on the guitar and the price. The next day he texted me the pics and price. It was a 1952 Telecaster in mint condition. He had the original receipts which was crazy! (That's how I knew the date). I asked what he wanted for it and he said he ""looked up Telecasters online and he thinks $4,000 is fair"". I texted back, ""I'll take it for $4,000"" and went to pick it up. The guitar had no sentimental value to him at all.

Here's the issue at hand. The guitar was/is worth approximately $50,000 depending on the buyer and I knew it. When I got the guitar I told my wife the price and what it was worth. She was floored. Fast forward two weeks her co-worker tells my wife he just found out what the guitar was actually worth from a family friend and wanted it back. She said, ""well he really likes the guitar and he knew it was worth $50,000 which is why he was floored you offered it to him for $4,000. He really likes it and I doubt he will sell it back, but you can ask."" (Probably not the smartest thing for her to say, but she was caught off guard and it's not her fault or problem). He contacted me and asked to buy it back. I said that it's not for sale. He then said I scammed him and he was going to ""sue me and take my wife to HR for being a part of the scam."" Which was nuts, but he actually did contact HR. They were cool about it and said it's not their problem. It's between him and me. Over the next few months he made things very uncomfortable for my wife at work. He would bug her constantly about it. She eventually had to go to HR for harassment and they actually let him go (She complained twice and he was warned and didn't stop). He's contacted me several times about it so I got a restraining order for harassment too. I blocked him too. I haven't heard from him in about a year.

AITA?

UPDATE: 

Well this post blew up way beyond what I was expecting. It looks like I was voted Not The Asshole. There's over 5000 comments. I couldn't read them all, but I did read a lot. Just to clear up some things. I left somethings out because I didn't want it to influence opinions and really wanted it to be about me buying a guitar at significantly lower market value vs the people in the story. I did include the fact that the guy was harassing my wife at work not to make the guy sound bad, but because I thought it was relevant to the story. Here's some specific details I chose not to include:

The guy and his dad were not close at all. So those people saying he was grieving and I took advantage of him, that is 100% not the case. When I went to get the guitar he was telling me he hadn't talked to his dad in six years and was actually annoyed he had to deal with a funeral.

The dad bought the guitar new and never played it. Luckily it was stored in a closet and not in a basement or attic. There's no issue with the wood or electronics. It plays like a dream and I couldn't be happier. I am not selling the guitar to the son or anyone. It will be with me for a long time. I'm in my 30's so maybe in 30 years it will find a new home.

I would have MAYBE considered giving the guy more money or giving him one of my guitars to sell on his own, but I decided not to do that after he left a terrible voicemail on my phone the day he found out the real value. He demanded it back like he was entitled to an object he sold fair and square, called me a POS, called my wife a POS and said he would ""do bad things"" if I didn't sell him the guitar back.

And to those people who say they would have told the guy the real value. That's a load of horse shit. If you went to a garage sale/estate sale and saw an item worth $5000 priced at $50 there's not a snowballs chance in hell you would walk up to the homeowner and tell them they mis-priced it. You'd buy the item and then tell all your friends and family what a great score you got! Don't even kid yourself like you wouldn't do that. I don't feel bad about buying an awesome guitar at a steal of a price. I was curios what others would think and it looks like I'm not the asshole so thank you reddit. I can play the guitar with zero guilt now. Not like I felt guilty before, but now my feelings are justified.",False,1585929318.0,2020-04-02 22:08:51

I took into account the advice offered and I thank you guys for your help.

HR meeting call with supervisor went well. The main incident in my original post wasn’t recorded but all six colleagues wrote a statement confirming what Sarah had said and how inappropriate it was. I didn’t realise but John had also asked others who work with us if they, at any point, heard Sarah attack my character or physical appearance in a cruel or improper manner and if they did, would they be willing to write a statement. Apparently, she has been saying quite a few outrageous things behind my back and it seems that a lot of the hurtful office gossip about me did originate from her. I submitted a few examples of messages and emails, sent by Sarah during work hours, taking jokes about my appearance too far. I also included the messages where I asked her to stop causing attention at work as I’m extremely uncomfortable with others regarding me in that way. Her claims of my bullying her and calling her flat chested and ugly at work were dismissed as she couldn’t specify dates or find anyone to corroborate her story or even provide any examples of me ever being hostile or unprofessional. The phone call we had after the video team meeting where she claims I used threatening language against her was also disregarded as no recording was made and it was her word against mine; Luckily, I don’t think they believed her on this point as I’ve never displayed anything near the type of agressive behaviour she was accusing me of and my character references had me down as the quiet sort who gets on with work. 
While things were being reviewed, Sarah decided to quit. She’s still adamant that I bullied and threatened her and felt no choice but to leave the toxic environment I created. I’ve been reassured that there was no wrongdoing on my part except that I should’ve reported things much sooner when inappropriate comments first started. From what I gather, Sarah’s general behaviour at work has raised concerns for a while and I wasn’t the first to complain about her. 

Some people were confused as to why I had considered her a friend in the beginning. When I joined the team 3 years ago, it was my first job out of uni and I was incredibly nervous but Sarah was the first to ask me questions and offer to hang out. She was a bit overbearing and rambunctious but I appreciated her efforts to get to know me and coax me out of my shell. We often did have a good laugh despite her sometimes making a joke at my expense but I tried not to take it to heart and occasionally reminded her to wind it in and be more considerate of my feelings. It’s only been during the past 8 or so months where she’s become especially rude and callous. I still referred to her as a friend of sorts but I never thought she would take things as far as she did.



**Edit:** Thanks to everyone for the kind words, advice and encouragement, it’s really blown me away. I stepped away to talk to John for a while and let him know what a great guy a lot of people think he is. His little smile was adorable.

Despite the misery at work I had to go through for a while, everything has turned out pretty amazing. I do love my job now that I can actually get on with it without the office drama. Finding out how my other coworkers feel about me has been incredibly reassuring and we’ve now set up a weekly virtual pub night. My outlook has improved massively and I’m taking steps to manage my anxieties and put aside past negativity.",False,1590959420.0,2020-05-31 17:44:36
"AITA for reminding my husband's female friend that my husband is MY husband, and not hers?",27300,Everyone Sucks,1821,fwp5gm,1586310962.0,"**UPDATE HAS BEEN POSTED AT THE BOTTOM**


My husband Jake and I have been together for six years, and he has been friends with Carly for two years longer than that. I suspect that Carly has feelings for Jake, but he has never had feelings for her. I've never been thrilled about their friendship, but I trust my husband and have total confidence that he would never cheat. 

A year ago, Carly moved into our neighborhood. She lives alone, and she picked up the habit of asking Jake to help her with house work and maintenance. When her water heater broke, she called Jake. When she needed help setting up a TV, she called Jake. When her trees needed trimming, she called Jake. Etc. Etc. You get the idea. 

Jake and Carly also work near each other downtown, and a few days a week she'll ask him for a ride to work when she doesn't ""feel like driving."" She's also started dropping by our house unannounced, usually when she's having a bad day and wants to vent to Jake about it. She relies on him heavily for emotional support 24/7. 

While I've tried to be patient and respectful of my husband's friendship with her, I have become less and less tolerant of Carly in the past few months as I feel she's become a constant presence in our marriage. 

The final straw came yesterday. As a medical worker, I've been pulling insanely long hours at the hospital. Yesterday I finally had a day off and I was very excited to spend some time with Jake. Just after breakfast, he received a text from Carly asking if he can help her move some furniture around because she decided to redecorate. He told her he can't because it's my day off and we're spending the day together. She then calls him and explains that it shouldn't take more than an hour, and her living room is a mess and she really could use his help getting things in order. At this point, I snapped. I took the phone and told her that Jake had said no and she needs to respect that he wants to spend time with me, his wife. When she started to argue, I said ""I'm sorry Carly but I think it's time for you to find your own husband,"" and hung up. 

Jake was shocked and thought that I was far too harsh. He thinks that I should have some compassion and said ""How would you feel if you were 35 and alone and without many friends? I feel sorry for her."" At that, I questioned whether or not I was actually in the wrong here. Reddit, AITA?

Edit: you all are right. I should not have included a description of Carly's physical appearance. It's not relevant to the story.




**UPDATE!!!!!**


Jake and I drank some wine and had a long talk about Carly. We both apologized. I said I was sorry for making a harsh comment to Carly, and he apologized for making me feel like he sometimes prioritizes her needs over mine. He said I will always be his #1 priority, and moving forward he will make that extra extra extra clear to Carly. He said that he should have set boundaries long ago and that Carly needs to learn to be less dependent on him. After that, we drank more wine and went through the comments on this post. We had a lot of laughs, plenty of things we agreed and disagreed with, and a lot of eye rolls. Reddit, you never fail to entertain.

Special shout-out to u/Dszquphsbnt u/1000livesofmagic and u/PaleHero. We enjoyed your comments the most.

After further discussion, Jake decided to give Carly a call. I apologized for my comment, and then I gave the phone to Jake and left the room so they could talk. I didn't hear the conversation, but according to Jake it did not go well. Carly was upset and defensive when Jake told her she was in the wrong for arguing after he and I had both told her no about the furniture moving issue. She didn't think she had crossed any lines and she told Jake that I was being too sensitive, controlling, and that I'm trying to end their friendship. Jake defended me and said it was his own idea to set boundaries and that I've never told him to stop being friends with her. They were both upset when the conversation ended. If either of us hear from her in the upcoming days I'll post another update.

Thank you all for your thoughtful comments and insight. We sincerely appreciate it. Except for those of you who commented that Jake must be cheating on me - y'all are the biggest assholes here.

For the record: after reading the comments Jake and I would both vote ESH on my post.",False,1586319406.0,2020-04-07 18:56:02

Hey folks! It's been like three weeks and many, many things have happened. I graduated high school (go me!), I turned 18, and I moved out! I finally feel like I'm adulting, kind of. I moved in with my sister the day after my birthday, and I've been living with her for a bit over two weeks. It's been really weird.

They do all of this stuff in her house that we never did as kids. Family dinners every night? Never done it once until now. My sister and her fiance carve out blocks of time to spend with the kids! My parents never did that. My oldest nephew (he's 10) dropped an open can of pineapple in the kitchen a few days ago. I expected him to get yelled at, but my sister just helped him clean it up and told him to grab a new can from the pantry. That was weird. My parents were never that chill.

When I was a kid I would see these perfect families on TV, (shoutout to dinosaur train lmao) and my parents always told me that those kinds of parents didn't exist. That it was all made up for TV. That real parents don't take that much of an interest in their kid's lives and interests. I believed them until now.

In the past few weeks, I've seen my sister and her fiance spend hours making model planes with my oldest nephew, or rocking the youngest to sleep when she was overtired. That stuff never happened when I was a kid. My niece (she's 4) woke up in the middle of the night last week, crying about something. Instead of telling her to stfu and go to bed, my sister's fiance got up and sat with her until she fell asleep. I guess I was just surprised that my experiences aren't the norm.

Anyway, both my brother and I are doing really well here. My brother has been cooking a lot (he's going to culinary school), and everyone seems to really appreciate it. I've been spending time with my nieces and nephew and I have played more Minecraft these past two weeks than I think I've played in my entire life. If anyone knows what Titanfall 2 is, please help me out. I've been an adult for less than a month and these children and their new-fangled video games already confuse me.

This is all just a very long winded way to say thanks. If I hadn't posted here, I don't think I would have moved out. My savings would basically be drained, and I wouldn't be as happy as I am now. So thank you. Now I guess it's time to see if I can figure out how to do an update post.



Edit: Shoutout to my sister for basically raising me for twelve years and also being an amazing parent. I could just go and say all this to her face but there's so many stairs in this house and I'm lazy. 

Kalani. How many times am I going to have to say it before you accept that you're a good person? Every time I go to thank you for giving up space in your house for me and Cam, you say that if you didn't help us out, it would have been someone else. I get that you have strangely low self esteem (as evidenced by your AITA post) but can you just accept that you're an unbelievably good person and move on so I can finally thank you?

UPDATE - AITA for getting a paternity test on my son who doesn’t look like me?,27246,UPDATE,1,h7k9wy,1591995701.0,"
Old post https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ggkfdz/aita_for_getting_a_paternity_test_on_my_son_who/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

After being ripped to shreds on my first post I didn’t plan to ever log in to this account again. Some recent events have persuaded me to update you all on what’s been going on. I’ll just get right to it. 

My wife and I are separated currently. I moved out so she and the kids could stay in our home. I’m staying with my parents for now. I don’t get to see my kids as often as I would like to. When I have a more stable living situation we’ll have joint custody of them. It’s been very hard on me and the kids. I talk to them on the phone every night, and they both keep asking when I’m coming home. It breaks my heart that I can’t answer that question.  My daughter is taking it the worst. I feel awful that her world had been turned upside down by her own parents. I miss my family. I miss seeing my kids everyday. 

I miss my wife. 

Our relationship has been put in limbo for now. She says she needs space to process, and doesn’t know if she will be able to forgive me. I’ve apologized in every way that I know how to. At this point I just have to give her the space she wants and hope she calms down. It would be horrible for us to throw away we built. If separating has been this hard in the kids, divorce is going to shatter them. She seems open to seeking couples counseling. It gives me some hope we can work past this.

As for reddit, I admit I didn’t want to hold myself accountable before. I couldn’t see how my actions were subconsciously harmful to my son. It was never my intention to be racist but I did treat my son differently due to his skin color when you strip it down to its roots. I realized how bad I fucked up when I felt ashamed thinking my wife has probably told her family why we separated. They used to think really highly of me. Now they all probably think I’m a racist. I have no one to blame for that but myself.

With all the craziness going on in the world I know that I need to be more aware of my actions. My kids deserve to have their family to be safe haven from racism. It scares me thinking about the type of world I will send them out into where they could be racially profiled in most places. I can’t imagine if it were my son on the news instead of one of those other poor guys. I’ll never let anything get in the way of my relationship with him again. Thanks all.",True,False,2020-06-12 14:01:41
AITA for watching GoT on an airplane?,27205,Not the A-hole,4781,dxlxxk,1574022250.0,"Two days ago, I was on a long-haul flight. I was sitting in an aisle seat. Since I haven't seen Games of Thrones yet, I was looking forward to binge watch the first season. I made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. An hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that I need to turn it off immediately. A little bit confused, I asked why. She told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. While I agree with that, I told her that I'm not going to turn it off. She then basically told me that I am an asshole for not considering other people around me. Is she right?

&#x200B;

Edit: I want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments:

\- I was wearing headphones all the time.

\- It was a flight with Swiss from Europe to a city in the United States. The in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. However I have to admit that probably none was as bad as GoT. However, none of these shows was censored as far as I can tell.

\- I'm not sure exactly where (aisle, middle or window) the kid was sitting since it was behind me and I think they switched seats frequently.",False,1574029914.0,2019-11-17 12:24:10
AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering,27142,Not the A-hole,3450,ejkij2,1578109265.0,"Today I dropped my dog off to get neutered. He's a six-month Goldendoodle. This was part of a ""puppy package"" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:

VT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...

Me: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.

VT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them. It's very standard and what the vet regularly recommends.

Me: Well, you did more than recommend it - you went ahead and did it.

\*silence\*

VT: I'll be right back.

...now it's important to note that I don't care about the $20 charge. Had I been contacted and told that they recommended this, I would have OF COURSE went with the vet's recommendation! But come on, at least act like I'm involved in the process rather than making me feel like I'm being suckered into a forced up-sell situation. A few minutes later, she came back...

VT: I spoke with the doctor and we are going to discount the $20 since we did not consult you first.

Me: It's not about the $20. I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.

VT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.

Me: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.

VT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.

Me: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?

VT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.

Me: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary. I'm upset that I was not consulted first.

VT: I'll be right back.

...this time she brought my puppy back with her. I thanked her and left. To be clear, I was not trying to be rude, difficult, or cheap in any way. But I got into the car with my poor sedated pup feeling like I was being rude, difficult, and cheap. I spoke with a few coworkers after I got back to my office, but I could use some other opinions as well. So, AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering?

\*edit: this has, obviously, gotten way bigger than I had ever thought it would. To anybody that posted on here to vent their spleen and then hit the front page, you know what I mean... that being said, I wanted to offer a few points of clarification because I've seen quite a theme in the comments:

1. Most important of all: my puppy is snoozing next to me and seems to be in overall good shape - for that, I'm grateful to the vet.
2. It amazes me how many of you post things like ""you're obviously NTA, why would you even post this""... scroll the comments and look at some people on the other side. The reason I posted this is that I was conflicted and was wondering what people thought - and wow, you folks did not let me down.
3. I don't plan on talking about who the vet/clinic/hospital is or where it is located. I was not pleased by their customer service, but I am not trying to hurt their business in any way (I will not even post a negative review even though I will be changing providers).
4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated. This would have been best handled, in my opinion, had the vet came to speak to me.
5. For the men that are messaging me thinking I am a woman: I'm not.

AITA for kicking out a girl from my daughter's sleepover bday party?,26918,Not the A-hole,2782,f9m670,1582713508.0,"My (34M) daughter (14F) had a sleepover b-day party last saturday, and she invited 5 girls from her school.

There was this one girl that she invited who I could tell from her attitude, was a spoiled brat. When she rang the doorbell, she walked in looking down at her phone, didn't greet me or my wife, and handed me her jacket without even looking up.

The whole night she was on her phone doing whatever the heck 14 year olds do on phones. I thought she was just embarrassed or shy because maybe she didn't know anyone, but according to my daughter, she is a ""super duper cool girl"".

Anyways, towards the end of the night, my daughter was opening her gifts. SB made a comment about every single gift. (not exactly snarky, but more like she was just unimpressed)

The final gift was from me and my wife, we bought her an iPhone 7 by pooling all of our remaining extra money to buy her it.

the SB scoffed because she had the newest gen iPhone. I helped my daughter set up the phone with a sim card, and the rest of the night they just hung out in her room.

My daughter came down a bit later and she was just sitting on the couch, I asked her what was wrong and she just went back up while saying ""why couldn't you have just bought me the newest iphone??"". That was really out of character for her, as she is always grateful for receiving anything.

My daughter left the phone on the table. I grabbed my daughter's phone to see a bunch of texts going back and forth between SB and my daughter, they exchanged numbers and the convo went something like this:

D ""hey its me""

SB ""thanks for inviting me to ur lame slumber party lol, and congrats on the iphone SEVEN haha""

D ""what""

SB: ""arent u mad that ur parents and friends got u such lame gifts""

SB ""slumber parties are for little girls lol, but wtvs its cool""

D ""u dont like the party..?""

SB ""I jus wish i could go home looool""

\~end

It was around 1AM and the girls were still up talking, I knocked and asked if I could speak with SB, she looked confused, I told her she needs to grab her things something came up. (I did this as to not embarrass my daughter in front of her friends).

I took her downstairs and asked her to call her mom, she asked why and I said ""because thats what you said right? that you wish you could go home? so go."" She was tearing up a bit, and made the call.

I talked w/ her mom for a bit when she came, I showed her the texts and she apologized profusely and said ""its just a teenager phase I guess. I'm so sorry, but dont you think she could stay? If not I understand.""

I thought ab it for a bit, but her staying probably would have made it awkward for everyone, so I told her it was best if they just left.

My wife said that I overreacted, and I should have just talked with SB rather than immediately kick her out, I firmly believe I taught her a good lesson that she needed to learn. It was MY DAUGHTER's bday, and I didn't want the rest of her night ruined because of some spoiled brat who was making it all about her. I guess she didn't exactly do anything wrong, but at the same time her attitude was unbelievable. AITA?",True,1582684882.0,2020-02-26 02:38:28
AITA for deleting my son's Minecraft world?,26931,Asshole,1481,gap4oq,1588250507.0,"I have 2 children, a 9 year old son and a 6 year old daughter. My son had a Minecraft world where he built quite an impressive castle on an island, which he was very proud to show to me.

Since school was canceled, he has had issues with waking up on time. He is supposed to wake up at 7 each morning, but for the past month he has been sleeping in until about 9 or 10. I always set an alarm for him, but he sleeps right through it. I don't wake him up because waking himself up is a skill that he needs to learn. I told him about 2 weeks ago that there are going to be consequences for him if he continues to sleep in every morning. At first, he understood and was waking up on time every morning. But for the past week or so, he has fallen back into old habits. I told him yesterday that this is his final warning. Today, he slept in until 11.

So I followed through with my warning, and went on the computer and deleted his favorite Minecraft world. I also took away computer privileges for the next month. When I told him, he started screaming and crying. He told me that he spent a whole year working on that world, and he's very distraught that he's never going to see it again.

AITA for refusing to give my niece our dog's room?,26786,Everyone Sucks,11845,db9dtn,1569867134.0,"For the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. I'll call her Princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. She is a medical researcher (Studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. I was apprehensive because I know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

We have a 4 bedroom house. Me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler Freddie. I told sister that Princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed OK with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. Princess even said it would be OK to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. It's getting a lot colder now and I'd never let Freddie sleep outside. 

I told Princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

In all honesty I was right in thinking having Princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. She goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. Since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

She's also rude to my kids. My daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but Princess was lovely enough to say that if her BF had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. Daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and I had a word with Princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

Had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. I made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. I also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that I wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. Sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. Sorry but how can I be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

EDIT: A lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. I won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. Firstly to the people who have claimed I was acting snobby about Princess's job. That wasn't the case. I wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that I could say she's ''only a researcher''. On the contrary, I specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. She earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. She just wanted more money to herself. 

Also, the people who claim that I was being nasty to her because I didn't like her and things like that. I don't dislike her at all. I was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, I've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. I was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. She has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because Princess constantly bullied her. 

Regarding the dog's room. There isn't any furniture in Freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

And for those who think I was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. We tried our best to make her feel welcome. Gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. We gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, I went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. Within her first week here, Princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that Freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

Regarding the weed and clubbing thing: I've nothing against weed use. I smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and I'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. If she was doing it away from the house I would not care at all. I wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. I'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. However, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

Last but not least, I didn't call her ''Princess'' on here offensively. I wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her Princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",False,1569870601.0,2019-09-30 11:12:14
AITA for leaving the family restaurant and starting my own after finding out I wouldn't inherit it?,26766,Not the A-hole,2769,gul6fn,1591048974.0,"My dad owns a pizza place that was handed down to him from my grandfather.

I've been working at the pizza place my while life, even part time while I got a business degree.

I found out last early last year that my dad had willed the restaurant to my stepmom. His reasoning being she needs to be taken care of after he dies. And that it would go to me after she died.

I was pissed and ""quit"" the next day. My dad ended up hiring two people to make up the work I was doing.

Now this is the potential asshole part. A month after I quit, I found a great location where another pizza place had shut down. I bought it and had it up and running in two months. My restaurant is take out only, but my business is doing extremely well. 

My dad reached out to me last September and said that his restaurant was losing business because of me and to please come back to the family business. He offered to buy my business so I would get something out of it.

I declined the offer. Now the craziness of 2020 happened and because my restaurant was already setup for takeout, I'm only seeing a 5-10% drop in revenue.

The family restaurant however, is going under.  

Now there's a whole lot of arguing about me causing my dad's family to become financially ruined.

My son has moved back in with me last weekend.

The older man had apparently stopped working and was drinking heavily and being very loud and critical of my son.

I got a phone call from my son on Saturday with him in tears and asked me to help him.

I jumped into my car and brought him home. I also yelled at the man and told him I'm calling the cops.

I then called an officer I knew to accompany us back to the apartment so we could get his stuff.

When we got there it looked like the man had moved out in a hurry.

So while the locks get changed by the wonderful landlord, my son is back home with me.

I'm happy he is rid of that predator but I'm extremely sad my son felt he had to get companionship from a man like that.

I have setup therapy appointments that my son will actually be attending now.

I hope with all my heart he can find the happiness he is looking for.

"AITA for having security at my mother's funeral, having certain people barred entry?",26615,Not the A-hole,2347,ejuz1p,1578161637.0,"My parents divorced ten years ago, my father initiated it. He was seeing someone else and wanted to see if the grass was greener on the other side. I neither am for or against his reasoning but I was against how he treated my mother after they finalized their separation. One key event that stands out is in deliberating how assets (or rather, debt) was divided, my father promised my mother that he'd still around, still be in her life, even be friends, and see if they could rekindle their marriage, but only if my mother took every penny of debt. My mother was naive to agree to it, because once the divorce was finalized, my father was on a plane in a matter of days, off to live his new life. It should be obvious that none of us were happy with my father, and I've been no contact the entire time.

My mother passed three weeks ago. She is survived by my two siblings and I. I was in charge of the funeral. I knew some of my cousins on my mother's side blamed my mother for their divorce and actively stayed in touch with my father. Imagine that, my mother's family took my father's side in all of this. I also knew there would be a nonzero chance my father would show up, and if he did, it would not be to pay his respects. So I hired security for the funeral and church service.

Long story short, my father and his new wife showed up. They were barred entry. One of my aunts got very upset and caused a scene and let slip her daughter, my cousin, invited him. So I had security escort my cousin out of the funeral, too. This event has caused a rift between families, or at least embiggened the one already there. A few of my aunts and a lot of my cousin think I went overboard, some even removing me from Facebook.

Was I the asshole in this situation? For what it's worth, I was not super close to those who were ejected from the funeral, nor the ones who caused a fuss. I can live a happy life having zero contact with them again, so I've lost nothing. I'm still no contact with my father (who flew out for the funeral).

edit: I appreciate the awards but this is a throwaway account. Why award a throwaway with anything?

There's nothing I'm really hiding here. I was the one who knew about the affair because my father left his e-mail open at home when he went off to work, and me being an immature teen decided to snoop. In them, his mistress-now-wife tried to convince him of fantasy things my mother did and tried to turn him against her. Things like she would ask my dad something my mother did to him that was maybe insignificant at the time and twisted it around so it became a bigger deal.

Like one instance is when I was much younger, my mother went to bingo without telling him. My dad was the sole income maker at the time. My mom won a fair bit of money but my dad was upset she never told him she went beforehand (with his money). Something that was resolved 10 years prior and which was insignificant in the grand scheme of things, she blew it up to bigger than it was. Many such cases like this she blew things up to convince him to leave my mom.

This is why I don't fault my dad for the divorce or separation: I fully blame the other woman. It sucked being 17 at the time but that's life, people get divorced, and it's not my place to get in the middle of my parents' relationship. However, I was upset with his behavior after the fact and the one event I mentioned. 

Much of my mom's extended family are more *traditional* and view divorce as a tragedy no matter the circumstances. They blame my mom for not ""trying harder"" to keep the marriage together. Once the divorce was finalized, my mother became an outcast to most of her family. This is why a lot of them favored my dad because he convinced my mom that she was why their marriage fell apart.

AITA for sending my son to school in a dress,26573,Not the A-hole,1471,d1jjlx,1568018479.0,"My son started second grade last week. I get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). 

He's got a twin sister. I told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. My son picked one up and said ""I want to wear this."" I'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. I'm pretty politically neutral so while I wouldn't say I was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that I could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. 

I figured ok, I wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so I shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. 

I drop him off and get to work. Three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. He was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. 

My wife is irate asking how I couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and I was setting our son up to fail. So is just about everyone else I've run this by. My wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as ""the one who wore a dress"" and I was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because I was in a rush and our son suffered for it. 

At the time, I truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that I put my son in harm's way so now I'm not sure whether I made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. AITA",True,False,2019-09-09 01:41:19
AITA for cutting off my mother when she got a paternity test for my daughter?,26543,Not the A-hole,3480,hd7upi,1592778667.0,"I've been with my wife for 8 years. We have 2 children, a 5 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. I've known since my wife got pregnant that there was a possibility our daughter wasn't my biological child. I don't care. She's my daughter and my wife has never been unfaithful. However, I don't want to know if she is or she isn't biologically related to me, and I've never wanted to know.

Edit to include the full story as people are assuming she cheated:  My wife and I were together for around 2 years when we had a fight and broke up. We were broken up for 3 months, during which we both slept with other people, and then we got back together. After approx 2 months of being back together, my wife found out she was pregnant. We knew there was a possibility of one other man being the biological father, and it was a toss up between me and him, but it was more likely to be mine. My wife was honest with me that she'd slept with other people when we got back together, and I was equally honest, and the window of conception for our daughter was just large enough we couldn't say for sure if she was conceived when we were together or apart and while she offered to get our daughter tested, I didn't want to know. My entire family were aware we broke up and got back together.

Visibly, she looks like her mother. Same dark hair, same dimples, same bone structure, and I see bits of myself in her, too, mainly in her mannerisms, with the only part that doesn't match up being her eyes, which are brown, while mine are green and my wife's are blue. Meanwhile my son, with his green eyes, blonde hair, and bone structure, looks like I cloned myself, and looks very different to his dark haired, dark eyed sister.

My mother has noticed, and remarks on it often. This really gets my wife's hackles up, both because of the reality behind that, which my mother is unaware of, and because she and my mother have clashed a few times in the past. They are very different people, and their personalities just don't mix.

Then a few months ago my wife's sister and my best friend (they're married) got into a car accident, they were in the hospital with one of their 3 kids, while the other 2 were home alone, so we asked my mother to watch our kids while we helped them out. Our kids were with her and my dad for about 5 hours.

Last week mum came over and said she had something important to tell me. When she had my daughter unsupervised, she did one of those DNA test kits on my daughter, comparing it to her own DNA (which she apparently ordered months ago for this exact purpose and was waiting to use it) and it confirmed my daughter isn't biologically related to me, and she began to tell me about a lawyer she could get me in touch with to begin divorce proceedings. I told her this changes nothing, she's still my daughter and that's my wife she's talking about. Mum was shocked, and called my wife some names I don't care to repeat. I told her to get out of my house.

It's been nearly a week. I've told my wife, blocked my mother on everything, and there's been constant calls and texts. My mother is furious I never told her that I had an inkling, and has since disowned my daughter, but says my son is still her ""special little guy"" so she wants a relationship with my son but not my daughter. In addition to my mother, all 5 of my siblings (3 sisters, 2 brothers), and dad are angry with me, they want me to get back in touch, and a couple of them have even said I should thank mum for what she did as she was looking out for me and now I know. However, I can't justify my mother going behind my back to get a DNA test on my daughter without consulting me.

I feel I'm in the right, but I also feel I could be overreacting, and I would appreciate another perspective as I'm seriously considering cutting contact with my mother over this.

AITA?

AITA for telling my sister to stop telling people that she has my illness to gain sympathy for being overweight?,26515,Not the A-hole,1480,gl3ib7,1589696088.0,"I (22f) have an older sister (25f). My sister is very sensitive about everything. When we were young, if I made the smallest comment like ""I prefer pink over blue"" it would make her cry because she thought I was aiming at her by saying it. My parents would always ask me to apologise to her since she's sensitive and I'm ""emotionally stronger"" than her. 

My parents never controlled my sister's diet growing up, letting her have what she wants since they found it too difficult to control her. 

I was skinny as a stick when I was a kid, so even though my family has a long history of thyroid disease my parents didn't think there was an issue with me. However, my sister has been overweight the majority of her life, so my parents thought she'd be the one with the thyroid issues. They took us to an endocrinologist when I was 10. I got a diagnosis for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis while my sister didn't, and instead got told to exercise and watch her diet. I got hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's, and have been on medication ever since. 

My sister and I moved back in with our parents due to what's happening these days. I leave my medication in a cabinet near the kitchen since I know I won't take it unless I have to actually get out of bed to do so. Apparently, I left a box before I moved out of my parents house when I was a teen and one of her friends saw it while they were over and asked if it was hers. My sister told them that it was, and that's why she was overweight. The box has ""Euthyrox"" written on it in big bold letters with a little picture of a thyroid gland next to it. So yeah, pretty obvious it was meant for a thyroid condition. 

She's held up this farce for almost 4 years. I only figured it out when I saw her take a box of it out of my bag one day. I confront her on it, and she starts crying and telling me that she just didn't want anyone to mean to her because she's fat. She also says that it's not fair that the one with the normal weight gets the thyroid disease.

I'm just staring at her gobsmacked. She's complaining that she doesn't have an auto immune condition? I tell her to knock it off, and that she can't lie to get sympathy from people. 

My parents talk to me later, and they say that I was too harsh calling her a liar and she probably needs a therapist or something and the classic ""I should apologise since I'm more mature"". They even tell me that they were hoping that she was the one with the thyroid issues as a child, so that they could justify her weight gain. 

I ask them ""so you wanted your daughter to be sick instead of admitting that it's your fault because you bought her mcdonalds whenever she wanted it, and never made her exercise?"" 

Now they're mad at me too.",False,False,2020-05-16 23:14:48
AITA for not allowing my father to meet my dying mother at the hospital?,26449,Not the A-hole,4157,e2nxtz,1574922172.0,"I'm a 25 year old guy and my parents were in the process of divorcing when my mother got diagnosed with a terminal illness. After the diagnosis, my father stalled the divorce proceedings. 



My father filed for divorce after 26 years of marriage after he fell in love with his younger business partner. She recently gave birth to his child. 

My mother was a stay at home mom for 25 years who took care of the entire household while my father worked long hours. 

She was blindsided when my father told her about wanting a divorce. He told her that he would always love her as his best friend and as the mother of his 5 children, but he was also in love with this other woman. 

My mother was devastated and stopped eating properly.


 In the middle of the divorce, she was diagnosed with terminal illness and was only given a few months to live. 

All this time, we, her children have looked after her. I took her to her appointments and we paid for the treatment by taking loans. We didn't ask our father for money, even though he was willing to cover the expenses. Legally, at the time of her death she was still married to my father. 

During her last days, my father had to move to another city to be there for his daughter's birth. My uncle made a facebook post asking for blood donation (she has a rare blood type) and stated that she was critical. When my dad got to know about it, he immediately flew down to our city. 

When he showed up to the hospital, he was in a bad shape. His clothes were unkempt. He wanted to see my mother one last time. I told him that there was no use of that as she was unconscious. He begged and cried in front of everyone, I still didn't allow him to meet her. (The hospital authorities let her family decide who was allowed to visit her) 

My mother passed away the next morning. He still didn't leave and wanted to be there for the funeral and memorial service. We banned him from attending.

I believe that he lost the right to see her in her pain when he was the one who caused her immeasurable pain. My buddy tells me that me and (my mother's family) are the assholes for not letting him see her one last time.
 
---------

Edit : I want to make some facts clear -

1) When my father told my mother that he was in love with his business partner and wanted a divorce, the other woman was already pregnant with his child. 


2) I was/am her legal representative (edit : Power of Attorney, to make things clear ). I had the legal right to deny visitors. My mother's entire family supported me in my decision to not let him see her. My grandma wanted the same. My siblings wanted the same.

-------------

Edit 2 :


3) During her last days, when she was in the hospice, she got to a stage where she could no longer communicate verbally. And she never expressed anything about wanting our father there. 

In fact, she didn't mention him at all. 

4) I realize that this means the end of my relationship with our father. I have accepted that and I have no interest in pursuing a future relationship with him, his new woman or his child. My siblings are on the same page.

We have accepted the fact that we have lost two parents forever.

I plan to be there for my younger siblings as their pillar of support.",True,1574950858.0,2019-11-27 22:22:52
AITA for acting like a conspiracy theorist to get out of political arguments with my Dad?,26445,Not the A-hole,1584,egncbw,1577543215.0,"My Dad loves to have political arguments/“discussions” with me and other members of the family. I honestly think he does not care about half these issues and just wants to have fights with me and other people in the family. I have tried to simply opt out of them, but my Dad will get upset at me for “not participating with the family dynamic” and “never talking to him.” I also don’t really want him to have these discussions with other members of my family, since they almost always end up in hurt feelings. I’ve been looking for a redirect for a while. 

I read a post online on doubling down whenever someone says a conspiracy theory, for example if someone says “they faked the moon landing” you say “haha, you sucker, you believe the moon is real?” I decided to implement the strategy after getting into way too many political arguments and upsetting myself and everyone around me.

My Dad saw something about climate change and started talking about how the Chinese government partnered with Obama to make it all up. I truly did not want to get into this political discussion. Instead I said, “oh, you’ve heard that, well get this” and discussed my new theory about how the federal government has created a tornado machine to set on people who want to vote Republican in the next election. He was truly flabbergasted at how stupid this was and decided to stop talking to me about this. It was wonderful. I’ve been doing it even more, and I haven’t had a political argument in a whole month. 

This Christmas, he had a doozy planned. My aunt and her wife are feminist and very pro-choice. At the dinner table, he tried to do a toast to the “death of Planned Parenthood.” Let me note that he is pro-choice, really doesn’t care about this issue, and has said so several times. I think he just wanted to start a fight for the sport of it. Time and place! I said, “oh, thank God you mentioned it, I have to tell you this news I learned” and I talked about how Planned Parenthood does not in fact perform abortions, since it’s physically impossible, but instead removes entire uteruses and replaces them with dog uteruses. 

I received a lecture about “not taking people’s political views seriously” from my Mom. I said it was just a strategy I use to diffuse political discussions. My Mom said, “you’re just making yourself look dismissive at best and insane at worst.”",False,False,2019-12-28 06:26:55
AITA for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him “uncomfortable”?,26297,Not the A-hole,3393,dpppvj,1572566961.0,"Using a throwaway. Some context; I live in CA, and my wife’s niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. She’s 22, I’ve known her since she was 4. Her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. She’s very sheltered by her mother. Anyway, I told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. She’s a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.

But then my wife goes, “And she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he’s 47.”

I’m 41, my wife is 42. I was like “You’re kidding, right?”

She wasn’t kidding. At first, I was like “Hell no.” But after about a week of talking, I gave in....with one caveat. I told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, I’m going to ask some questions he might not like. She wanted to know what kind of questions, and I gave her some.

1. How did you guys meet and who made the first move? (If the dude made the first move, it’s weird).

2. Has the dude been married, does he have kids?

3. Why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?

4. Are you (the dude) aware of the young woman’s history with her father? 

5. What’s the end game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

I know, I’m not the girl’s father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

So, fast forward to the visit. Niece and old dude show up. I’m cordial. I wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. 

After only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this is “None of my business.” I got a little pissed at that. 

I told him he’s staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And the girl is my niece, I’m not out of bounds here. He told me I was making him “uncomfortable”. I replied that I’m uncomfortable having a dude who’s clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said You can answer my questions and act like you’re a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

Well, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me. They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again, I was told it’s none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.

So Am I an asshole for questioning this guy?

EDIT: some info:

I asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got “uncomfortable”.

I would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

When I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.

I would love to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. So it goes.

Edit 2: Some of you here asked what’s up with my wife and her sister. Her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. They’re wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.

FINAL EDIT: Some of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn’t have a problem. 

Talked to my niece this morning. She and I are totally fine. Knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. I apologized for my actions regardless. 

Asked why they broke up.

The guy was cheating on his wife. He confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. Has three kids. All her age or older. She dumped him.",True,1572635951.0,2019-10-31 17:09:21
AITA for not inviting the neighborhood snitch or the HOA board to our neighborhood BBQ?,26271,Not the A-hole,1694,fkrfu6,1584574546.0,"There's around 10 houses in my neighborhood of 120 that are not in the HOA, mine included. We (or previous owners) were smart enough to not join the HOA. As a result, i am able to make extensions and I have a pool, which I host neighborhood parties occasionally. My HOA is one of the worst HOAs, constantly fining people hundreds of dollars for parking violations, painting their fences the wrong shades of brown, wrong  color curtains, having 2 flags etc. They're not the worst HOA but they're bad. We also got a shitty neighbor, Jessica, who likes to go around and snap photos of people's violations and then post it on the next-door app to shame them. She prides herself in this thinking it makes the neighborhood better when she shames the Smiths for having a fence thats 2 inches too high, or the Johnsons for having light brown door instead of a dark brown door. Jessica is a fucking cunt, she's probably cost neighbors thousands of dollars in fees or forcing them to renovate. I absolutely lost my shit when Jessica posted in the next door app about how Mrs Jenson (85 year old woman, currently having serious medical issues) has a lawn thats a couple inches too high. She obviously can't mow the lawn and was too busy to notice. The HOA then fined her 500 dollars.

I made a post in the next-door app about the next-door app saying that the suburban fascists on the HOA nor Jessica were invited to my BBQ at my house. Jessica went on a ran saying how much of a angel she is and how she protects the neighborhood doing her duty and I told her she's a low life scumbag busybody and is a pathetic loser with nothing better to do. A couple people said I was bullying and excluding her and like 4 of her friends are ""boycotting"" my party and hosting their own party.

AITA for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?,26264,Not the A-hole,3240,duadu9,1573414385.0,"My sister is 16 and heavily overweight. She's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. She's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.

As a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

It was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed in the future. I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up.

AITA for telling my parents they made my sister getting pregnant ruin my life?,26270,Not the A-hole,3787,gekfhn,1588802062.0,"shes 23f im 18F. Grandma died 8 years ago, and she left more than enough money to pay for all her grandkid's colleges educations with a few stipulations: dont get arrested, do drugs, be a drunk, get pregnant / get someone else pregnant. The money was put into accounts in the parents names since we were all kids then.

In sophomore year my sister got pregnant. Shit hit the fan panicking about college, the baby daddy left & she hasnt tried to find him/get child support, & the stress from that caused a hard complicated pregnancy. both are ok.

Mom * dad still let her go to college as long as she didnt have another and maintained a 3.5 gpa. which she did. She graduated last December with about 2 grand in debt, I figured her money must have been used to help raise her kid and pay for her pregnancy the past 2.5 years so she had to get a bit of a loan. which seemed understandable.

Boy I was wrong! I got accepted to my dream college on the other side of the state, but mom kept trying to get me to go to a cheaper one near home so I dont need a dorm and it would be a cheaper school. I asked her why she was so insistent, grandma left plenty of money i thought. Turns out, they flushed all the money that was supposed to go to me down the toilet to take care of my sister & her kid & her expensive pregnancy, turns out was a lot worse than I was led to believe.

I broke down and just lost it crying harder than I ever have. Shouting how they fucked me over and ruined my life for the kid that fucked up. now I'll have at least 70k debt if I go to school. I guess this upset my sister and she asked in a very upset tone if id rather her be out on the streets destitute and unable to care for her kid(who she 'reminded' me was a living being) because she didnt have an education/support system just so I could go on to college and have a good life.

I said yes, how its not fair that she got to fuck up, get drunk and sleep with so many guys she doesnt know who the baby daddy is(something she told me but apparently not mom or dad), kept breaking rule after rule while I havent ever even had sex with my bf. And now Im the one that has to be punished for it.

everything just keep devolving in to more yelling/fighting until I left. Ive been staying with my bf for the past few days. I know with the rona i shouldnt gp anywhere but i just wanted to be with the one person i feel like actually gives a damn about me.

moms been texting/calling trying to get me to come home, saying if i can just be reasonable and not vilify my sister we can probably work something out. I told her unless she has money grandma left for me dont talk to me until I have my college loans paid off in 50 years.

Did I go too far? A lot of it was driven by emotion but i really feel fucked over here and like im being punished despite being the one that followed the rules.

I've since slept with my bf, i figure if Im getting punished same as if i would have broken all the rules i can at least have fun.

EDIT: been texting sis some this morning to try and mend stuff with her since i didnt think mom and dad spending the money was her fault. she was told about it after she graduated and was asked to keep me in the dark. She has offered to pay for 'a book or two' but not more since she wants to move out to 'get out from under mom and dad's thumb'. probably to party again since she doesnt hide how much she misses it.

AITA for telling a friend’s friend that he couldn’t keep the “jackpot” that he hit on my antique slot machine? (About $700),26251,Asshole,7010,cm0bft,1564975037.0,"I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I’d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

Well a friend’s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I’d be happy to give him his quarters back if he’d asked but I’m not a casino and while I’m not destitute, I can’t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he’d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

Edit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because I've been banned.

Edit2: wow since I’m a “baby gangster” who has been running an “illegal gaming operation” (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I’m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

Edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

If the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I’ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the “winner” thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN’T be this dramatic in real life...I’m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I’m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don’t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don’t  in the process.

Edit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I’ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can’t “afford” to give it to him. 

Say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that’s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You’d say yes. Now let’s say a guy you’ve never met says “hey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I’m taking the whole thing.” You would say no. It’s how I’ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I’ve given people quarters to play, I’ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I’ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That’s a nickel a day. that’s not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


Edit5: a good question:

>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

No he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

Edit6: another good question

>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?


I would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

Edit7: 

>INFO
We need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine

So this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if I'm way off base.

Edit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried.

> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you’ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

Edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say ""your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?""  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

Edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

Edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.


Edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of you however were cool.",True,1565368805.0,2019-08-04 20:17:17
AITA for dressing nicer than the couple getting married?,26231,Not the A-hole,4336,cpti8j,1565733477.0,"A few months ago, my brother and now SIL announced their intention to marry. The invitation to the wedding stated ""No dress code. Wear whatever is comfortable for you."" In hindsight, I think they put that there since the event was at a lake. I didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, I should dress respectably for such an occasion, and I have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.

Yesterday was the wedding. When I showed up, I noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than I was. I'm talking Polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. I did feel a little out of place. My brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my SIL was wearing a modest white dress. The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I'm marrying the SIL, but that was it.

A few hours ago, I got a call from SIL. Holy shit, she is pissed at me! She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.

Was I in the wrong?

Edit: clarified she said I stuck out on the photos.

Edit 2: My brother said I'm welcome to come over for dinner later. I unblocked her number. No call spam, so that's a good sign.

Edit 3: Had dinner with my brother and SIL earlier. She showed me the pictures, and I can kind of see what she was talking about. I told her I'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because I did notice I was out of place and I should have tried to do something. She said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. So yeah, I don't think we're gonna be on Jerry Springer as far as I can tell.",False,1565757958.0,2019-08-13 14:57:57
AITA for DEMANDING my SIL replace the expensive fabric she and her children DESTROYED with EQUAL fabric?,26143,Not the A-hole,2946,e4nn5v,1575262827.0,"I am STEAMING mad about this and everyone around me is pretending like I'm being a cunt. I'll let you people decide. First, I sew my own clothes. My husband and I live in a very nice house with a HUGE room filled with gorgeous sunlight for my hobbies.

We hosted Thanksgiving. My SIL and her three kids were staying with us, despite that she always treats me like shit for preferring pets over kids.

On Tuesday, as I went to do some last-minute shopping, my SIL texted about a tablecloth for her kids to put down while they did Christmas ornaments. I walked her through the closet with the VERY. CLEARLY. MARKED. TABLECLOTHS.

I got home 3 hours later and checked in on everyone. When I went into the hobby room where everyone was gathered, I saw it. SHE PULLED MY FUCKING ATELIER BRUNETTE FABRIC FROM THE CLOSET. MARKED. FABRIC. This particular style was discontinued several years ago, but I snagged for $25/yard. I had 6 yards. Let me note that fabric is EXPENSIVE and I have always sourced from thrift stores, deep clearance, etc. This was a GIFT to myself.

I fucking screamed ""What the hell are you doing?!"" and ran to the table. She looked alarmed and acted like she had no idea what she'd done. Her fucking kids spilled all kinds of paint all over the fabric. I told everyone to STOP, put DOWN the crafts, and get OUT.

After I fucking cried over that fabric and tried my best to salvage it, I demanded she replace it, and said how. She argued that she had no way of knowing that ""ugly ass"" fabric was for something other than a tablecloth, because it didn't look like anything anyone would ever wear seriously. I said I expected 6 yards.

Black Friday she and the girls handed me a JoAnn Fabric bag. They handed me 6 yards of an absolutely hideous Keepsake Calico fabric. Typically $9.99/yard but on sale for $3.99 this weekend.

I asked her if she was being serious, and she said yes, here's 6 yards of ugly ass fabric. I deadpanned ""Get the fuck out of my house. Now."" and she got very angry and started arguing with me that it's not her fault that I have expensive taste. I told her to leave, now, and not to come back unless she has EQUAL. QUALITY. FABRIC.

Of course I'm being told what an awful, evil person I am because I wouldn't ""graciously"" accept her insult of shit quality quilting cotton. For those who don't know fabric, this was like presenting someone with a 2001 Honda Civic after crashing their 2020 Maserati.

AITA?

**EDITED AT THE REQUEST OF A POSTER:**  To be very clear, SIL had to go *far* out of her way from where I directed her to grab the fabric. It was not even kept in the same room, let alone closet, as the tablecloths which were CLEARLY marked. There was no reason for her to be IN the fabric closet. The was not an ""honest mistake"" by ANY stretch of the phrase. When we were on the phone, I directed her SPECIFICALLY to the linen closet. She had to DELIBERATELY go OUT OF HER WAY to grab the fabric.

**SECOND EDIT:**  The linen closet is next to one of the bathrooms, where I directed her. Each shelf is labeled with what they're for, towels, guest towels, bed, guest bed, etc. I said ""You see the shelf marked tablecloths? There's one with paint on it. You can use that."" The fabric closet is in the master bedroom (NOT the craft room even), and each larger cut of fabric is kept inside of a plastic tub, often times in a vacuuum sealed bag, labeled with the yardage, manufacturer, and fiber content.

**THIRD EDIT:** Several people seem to have a personal issue with my writing style, use of caps, explanation of my large hobby room, etc! These aren't part of the issue, but seem to really upset some of you. I find that very interesting and wonder if it would be the same if it was a man describing his video game dungeon and battle station! I take a lot of pride in coming from a working class background and having a room dedicated to my hobbies. I hope you all get to enjoy a space of your own eventually as well. <3",True,1575251410.0,2019-12-01 21:00:27
AITA for telling my drywall guy to stop bugging my babysitter?,26898,Not the A-hole,2238,hip54w,1593558593.0,"We are doing some house renovations and so workers are in the house. Today two guys were putting up drywall in the living room while our babysitter is playing with our daughter in the family room while I’m working in my downstairs office. 

I hear the drywall guy asking personal questions to my babysitter until her answers started getting short and her tone changes. 
IE: 
Guy: So where do you live ? 
Her: North of here
Guy: Yeah but where?
Her: It’s kind of a weird spot

That’s when I finally walked upstairs and told him, “What is this? The census? She’s watching my kid. Let her be. “ I thought I did it in a joking manner but I guess it came off harsher than I intended. My wife promptly informed me I was an asshole to the guy and the babysitter had it under control. 

I get that white knighting is a thing and that I may be out of touch with where I should be putting my foot down so I leave the verdict all of you. 

Am I the A-hole?


Update: We spoke about the situation at just before she left. I apologized to her for the weirdo and let her know he won’t be back. To quote her, “The thirsty ones never get the hint.”

The most eye opening take away from this  was when she told my wife and I, “If you think that was bad you should check out my DM’s”. Her instagram messages are from people who should be put on the sex offender registry. Guys offering her $700 a week to hold them, guys she has never met offering to buy her plane tickets, and straight up dick pics. How are dick pic people not out on the sex offender registry? It’s just street flashing with less effort. It’s insane and it’s apparently just a norm with the way she brushed it off. 

My wife is deflecting from whether I’m still the a-hole but I’ll take what I can get. In her defense, even the babysitter noted that while my comment was funny, my tone was actually straight up yelling at the guy. It’s a give and take like anything in this world. 

Anyway, thank you all for your input and here is to hoping the “thirsty” ones get a job which has them work from home and off social media.",False,1593611546.0,2020-06-30 16:09:53
AITA for going no-contact with my parents after learning they had lied to me about my allergies all my life?,26112,Not the A-hole,2256,h808dd,1592050042.0,"Hey everyone. I am 19 years old and my parents are in their 50s.

For as long as I can remember, I have been allergic to several things:

* Dairy

* Wheat/Flour/Gluten

* Legumes

Since I was a young child, my parents have completely kept all of them out of our house. While other kids ate breakfast cereals, I ate fish and assorted pickled vegetables for breakfast. While other kids had Lunchables, I had grilled chicken or fish with, again, assorted vegetables (usually sweet potatoes). While other kids ate birthday cake at the birthday party, I had an apple. 

I never questioned this until a couple of months ago. I was at my aunt's house for my birthday party, and she made brownies for everyone. For me, she took great steps to make them with almond flour and avoided all of my allergies. I started eating them and thought little of it until my aunt suddenly looked at me and, in a panicked way, asked which plate I took the brownies from. I pointed from the one where I got my brownies, and she immediately stood up and told me we had to get my EpiPen. She raced to ask my mother for it, and I sat there scared out of my mind because I had never mistakenly eaten flour before.

I noticed my mother had calmed her down, and then she said that we don't have to worry because she had switched the plates of brownies, and after all I had eaten the ones made with almond flour. I found this incredibly odd because, really, why would she swap the plates? That doesn't even make sense. But for the time being I let the issue rest.

It didn't sit well with me for about a week and I finally went to get an allergy test. The doctor started with a skin prick test, and lo and behold, I didn't react to any of the above substances. Then he ordered a blood test, and when the results came in, they said that I had absolutely no intolerance to any of the foods I'm supposed to be allergic to.

I was furious and called my mother. She eventually admitted that she lied to me because she wanted me to be on a paleolithic diet, and wanted me to be able to avoid all temptations. She raised me with a lie about her own health, but she keeps insisting that I try to see it from her perspective. She spams my phone with messages about how healthy I am--that I never had acne, that I have been in great shape my whole life, that I have strong teeth and bones, and even that I got onto a D1 college tennis team. 

She has started calling me ungrateful for her intervention and insisting that I really should be glad I never got ""carb addicted."" I don't know what to think. I carried around an EpiPen for all those years--one that I suspect may be fake seeing as my mother never got me to replace it--and I don't even know anymore.

"AITA for letting my brother call me ""dad"" and refusing to tell him the ugly truth?",26049,Not the A-hole,1126,ehmsme,1577745556.0,"I'm well aware that this story sounds extremely hard to believe and fake, and I'm aware that there will be many ""shitpost"" comments below. Sorry, but this story is 100% true and it is a hot topic of discussion in my family at the moment.

I was born when my parents were both 19, and my only other brother (let's call him Josh) was born when they were 42. They divorced shortly after Josh was introduced to the world (he was 4 months old at the time), and they both wanted nothing to do with the child. At the time, I was 23 and I was living alone with my then-girlfriend who was 21 (now my wife), and I done my best to convince at least ONE of them to take care of young Josh for his sake and the family's sake, but they refused adamantly and said that I should be taking custody of him instead. So I became legal guardian of my brother and he's been living with us for the past 12 years and things have been going really smooth for us.

Josh, now almost 13, has been calling me ""dad"" and my wife ""mum"" and our two children (4F, 9M) his siblings and he has absolutely NO idea about his real parents, and to be honest, I let all of that slide. He has NO idea that I'm really his blood brother and not his father, and I'm starting to feel guilty and a little weird.

Some of my uncles and aunts come to visit occasionally and they are really disgusted at the fact he calls me ""dad"" and they are surprised I haven't told him the truth. They constantly messaged me, talked to me in private and I cannot chat to them without this one particular topic rising up - badgering me to let him know already but I refused.

I discussed this with my wife and she thought it would be wrong to tell him the truth because none of my parents wanted to take care of him and I'm the only person in the world who gave him the ""father figure"" everyone deserves.

I feel that he has the right to know what he is to me and what I truly am to him, but he's suffered enough already and I just want things to continue how it is. Reddit, AITA? WIBTA if I let him know the truth?



**UPDATE**: About 70% of the comments are advising me to tell my son who I really am to him, and some are saying ""sooner than later"". I've just got up to discuss this with my wife and now after a lot of hesitation, we've decided that it's best the truth comes from us and it has to come now. Right now, it's late for us, but we shall address this to him first thing this week, or even tomorrow. Thanks guys.",True,1577730948.0,2019-12-30 14:39:16
AITA for having pot cookies out in the open in my own home?,26041,Not the A-hole,1525,hc7wd7,1592626462.0,"this is an ongoing situation, and am currently writing this as my niece is having a full-on meltdown. so I apologize for any mistakes.

today was my day off and i decided to whip up a batch of pot cookies (cookies that have weed extract in them) so i can snack on them for the weekend. after they finish baking i left them out on a cooling tray so they can set. just as i finished cleaning up the kitchen i hear the door bell and went to answer, and surprise surprise it's my sister with 8yo niece and husband. it's been awhile since I've last seen them to it was a happy surprise. i let them in, and the smell of cookies still in the air, and niece goes bolting towards the kitchen. 

i instantly go chasing her and as i round the corner into the kitchen, niece had just grabbed a cookie and was about to eat it, quick on my feet i swooped in and grabbed the cookie out of her hand saying that these were adult cookies. which caused niece to start freaking out. my sister followed in and i explained to her that these cookies had pot in them and assured her i was able to take the cookie away from niece before she had ate any.

she instantly blows up at me saying i shouldn't have pot cookies out when there are kids in the house, i explained how i had just finished baking them and they were setting, and the fact that i didn't expect ANY children to be around (i am a single man, no kids), she asked if i had any thing that wasn't ""laced"" and unfortunately i didn't, by this point niece has locked herself in the bathroom and is crying.

and my sister gave me a big ol' lecture about having drugs in reach of kids, while i stand on the premise of, there wouldn't be an issue *if i had even known they were planning on dropping by today.* she called me a huge irresponsible asshole, and i responded ""well maybe if you taught your daughter to not just grab shit, we wouldn't be in this mess!""

she left to try to get niece out of the bathroom and i'm sat here typing this, am i really the asshole here? like i can understand not having drugs out in the open with kids around, and i never would - *if i had known there were going to be kids around.*

AITA for telling my grandma she looks like Ronald McDonald because she wouldn’t stop telling me I look like a bull with my nose ring in?,26003,Not the A-hole,2425,cre4qy,1566026145.0,"Edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought I’d make an edit. My piercing is NOT a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. Septum piercings are usually tagged as “looking like a bull” (I don’t agree with that) but I have my hoop in my nostril.

Here’s how it happened. Every time I see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of “take that thing out of your nose, you’re ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull.” The last time she said it to me I politely asked her to leave it alone or next time I wouldn’t be so polite. To be fair this is the first time I spoke up because I’m not confrontational but the older I get the more I stand up for myself. And for that matter, I shouldn’t even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. 

Fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. I immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like Ronald McDonald. A lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but A) I warned her and asked her to stop and B) she’s insulting my appearance so why is what I said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? I’m usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn’t even make sense) does not “ruin” my face and even if it does it’s really not her place.

AITA? Suing my neighbor after she sprayed weedicide on my lawn,25988,Not the A-hole,1923,gkyfn9,1589678532.0,"Caught my neighbor spraying weedicide on my lawn (in my fenced in backyard) because she said “she was sick of all the weeds” and thought she was doing me a solid.

1. I like dandelions they are good for the bees

2. I have pet rabbits, dogs, cats, and a tortoise i like to roam the yard and all of them eat or at least nibble and lick the grass so it’s literally poisoning my pets.

So anyway, I kick her the fuck out and take all my pets inside.

Now 2 of my rabbits are dead and another is in critical condition. I’ll never be able to let my pets outside again to eat the grass because weedicide takes forever to go away because it can sit in the soil for who knows how long and Im worried that the dogs and cats might end up having a reaction too since they also nibble the grass (call me overprotective or over cautious IDC I love my animals) 

So I’m suing her for: damage to my property because it is now unusable for my animals, veterinary bills, and emotional damage due to the deaths of my two rabbits.

I’m also trying to get the cops to pursue a case of animal abuse or at minimum criminal damage because she did basically poison my animals but I doubt anything will come from it because I have to prove ill-intent but they are pursuing her for criminal trespass. 

She’s a Karen. I think she deserves it for thinking she had any right to be on my property at all; and especially because it’s killed my pets and now Idk what to do about my lawn because I’m not risking another animal’s life by letting them out (at least unsupervised for at least a year. However my parents and my girlfriend think I’m being unnecessarily cruel because it “was an accident and she thought she was just being a good neighbor, and that Im making it to be a bigger deal than it is” and should just ask for her to pay my vet bills

Edit: info, she has asked me about the weeds before

I don’t remember it verbatim but Basically the conversation was along the lines of

Her: “hey I see you have a lot of dandelions/ weeds have you noticed that too” 

Me: “yup i enjoy the look of a natural lawn” 

Her: “Something about my new car.”

The end

Since she has a kid that she always asks can come over to play with my rabbits I assumed she knew they ate them if she was looking over my fence that often she’d notice the dandelions were only ever flowering in 1/4 of the lawn at a time because my rabbits got cycled in a way that most of the lawn was mostly weed free while the part they couldn’t get to that week would be sprouting

Edit again: thanks for the messages guys. Im taking the advise and getting a security camera and a padlock for the fence; also i am in fact getting a necropsy done.

Edit edit edit: i have talked to her. Told her that my rabbits died after the fact and there was staining on their pen. She said “it’s weedicide not pesticide; they were probably just sick”

Edit edit edit (last edit this is blowing up too much I gotta walk away sorry if i didn’t answer your question) but my rabbits were actually outside when she did this and there was a stain on their pen. I can’t prove it but Im pretty sure they got a direct spray.

UPDATE: I got a call from my vet monday morning the necropsy is back my rabbits died from corrosion to several internal organs and had corrosive burns lining their mouth and nose. 

My 3rd rabbit can also come home today and only has minor injuries to his throat and a small injury resulting in superficial hair loss and mild irritation on his nose. He’ll be on pain meds and just in case I have critical care ready 

For those without rabbits when rabbits are in pain and sometimes in mourning they sometimes refuse to eat so critical care is basically a mix powder you can syringe feed to keep their digestive system functioning because GI stasis can be life threatening.

Also I’ve contacted a lawyer to move forward with a lawsuit, but they haven’t responded, probably won’t until later today because i contacted them yesterday through email. 

And for the lawn and garden people from my last post the vet thinks the stuff the neighbor used wasn’t a commercial herbicide because of those chemical burns as well as because it killed my crabapple tree and the bit near my fence and pool are bare.

I have no reason to keep you guys updated for any reason; my life and my animals at the end of the day is my business not yours. I will try to keep you updated but remember this is my LIFE.

AITA for not telling my ex I got pregnant,25980,Not the A-hole,1902,h83lq5,1592065655.0,"I (28 F) was with my ex-husband for about 6 years. During this time, we were trying for a baby but had no success. 

About 4 years into our marriage, our marriage had a rough patch. My ex had stress had work and slept with his coworker to ‘relieve’ it. He confessed to me rather quick and a week later, they sat me down and told me they were expecting a child. 

I was an idiot back then and so I felt like I should forgive him because I truly believed he loved me and I thought I had no one.  

It wasn’t. My ex’s family treated me like their own, but my ex’s supposed daughter was the apple of their eye. As a result of that, my exs coworker was frequent presence in our lives. They felt like they had to include the mom of their grandchild for everything too and she made her way in every family picture and memory. It didn’t help that I suspected that the coworker had feelings for my ex and flirted with him when she can. 

People thought that she was my exs wife constantly and I finally had enough when during the baby girls first birthday party when I was told to take a picture of my ex, his mistress, his daughter, and his parents and it didn’t include me. It hit me that I was now treated as the other woman and I realized that I deserved more than this bullshit. I filed for divorce a few months later and left. It was the hardest time of my life but I ended up getting a promotion at work and met this sweet, wonderful guy. 

Fast forward to now, me and my boyfriend are madly in love and I gave birth to an adorable baby girl that I considered a miracle baby. I got pregnant with my boyfriend like 3 months after dating him and I thought that it was strange that this could happen since my previous failed attempts with ex and had thought that I was the infertile one. It crossed my mind then that maybe he was the infertile one and he only believed mistress was pregnant with his child because they were having an affair. I didn’t say anything though because it was not my place anymore. 

However, my boyfriend was so happy about my daughters birth and posted it on Facebook and tagged me in the post. I was still friends with my ex SIL on FB and she saw the post. She called me up and said that she was hurt that I didn’t let her know that I could actually get pregnant and the lack of child during my first marriage could be my ex’s fault. He took a paternity test. 

The poor baby girl was NEVER my ex’s. The coworker apparently was dating this ‘terrible’ guy during the time she slept with my ex and didn’t know who the child’s father was so she just strung my ex along cause she had feelings for him and thought he’d be the best father for her child. 

Now my ex blames me for not telling him that I was pregnant way before and him having to father this girl. He’s doing pretty bad now and I can’t help but feel guilty like I should’ve told him.

EDIT: I didn’t realize that I could edit my post even after the 3000 character limit. 

Okay so first of all, I keep seeing that people have seen other posts like mine and some youtube video (??). If so, I’m upset that others have had similar situations as me and that some people find the situation so hilarious that they make a video out of it. I’ve also never posted on reddit before (I had a previous account for browsing not posting). 

I don’t think I have to prove my story and I honestly posted this not to seek validation that my ex supposedly is the worst ever, but to gain perspective since my ex and his family were MY family and close confidantes for a large period of my life. We were pretty close and I had promised to keep in touch after the divorce (which they were super upset about), but I really couldn’t after everything that happened between us. They’re now super pissed at me for the divorce and for being complicit in my ex taking on the expenses of his not-daughter and forming a paternal connection with her for longer than he should’ve. 

EDIT: So here’s what’s been happening right now, I haven’t spoken to them after this and have been avoiding my ex’s calls. He texted me saying that he is sorry and overreacted and felt guilty about prioritizing ‘people who were never really family’ over me. I only replied with asking how his daughter is because even though she isn’t biologically his, she’s still his girl. She seems like an adorable kiddo and adores her dad :(. My ex‘s mistress is able to support the girl financially so my ex won’t contribute to that but he says that he’s still going to see her every month because he feels morally obligated to. I feel bad for the girl so much because she seems to have lost her family unit (dad, grandparents, cousins).",False,1592097552.0,2020-06-13 09:27:35
AITA for putting my dog's wee-wee pads on the bathroom floor b/c my BF has bad aim and keeps missing the toilet?,25939,Not the A-hole,4078,gdhfdi,1588646659.0,"My boyfriend (30/M) and I (28/F) have been together about a year and when our city implemented lockdown for the virus, he decided to quarantine with me at my apartment as I live alone and have a nicer apartment and he has several roommates.

Mostly it has been going well and thankfully we both still have jobs, except in the first few weeks I started noticing that the bathroom floor was suddenly always wet around the toilet. (The sink is across the room from the toilet so it's unlikely to be from the sink.) At first I thought it might be water but soon realized that it was definitely pee. I asked BF about it nicely, and he apologized and said sometimes he has bad aim. I asked him to try a little harder and he said sure.

The floor continued to be frequently spattered with piss, and a few weeks later I confronted him about it again because I think it's pretty gross to step in his pee several times a week, and it seems like an easy thing to fix. If he misses the toilet, I think the very least he could do is make sure to wipe it up with toilet paper or a Clorox wipe. (The cleaning supplies even live in a cabinet directly over the toilet.) He said sure, sorry, he would try to remember to do that. 

Another week has passed and while maybe he's doing this sometimes, I've continued to step in splatters of his pee and wipe it off the floor and clean the floor several times a week. I thought about asking him to just pee into the bathtub or something instead, because I don't understand how you can pee on the floor by accident so often and not notice and not clean it up.

Last night I got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and absolutely stepped in piss for the 12312301298th time. I had HAD it and I didn't want to pick a fight or ask him again since it seems clear he can't or won't change, so I got one of my dog's wee-wee pads from when he was a puppy (he is well trained now) and cut it up a bit and taped it down to make a sort of ""skirt"" or mat around the floor near the toilet to at least absorb the piss. 

BF saw this morning and is FURIOUS with me, saying that I'm calling him a dog, comparing him to an animal, etc. Honestly, I was not thinking that at all, I just was trying to be resourceful and solve the problem for myself since I don't like piss on my bathroom floor and don't like stepping in it, I didn't feel like arguing about it anymore, and putting a material specifically meant to absorb pee around the area he keeps peeing on by accident seemed like a practical solution.

AITA for cancelling on a group of very out of shape women that hired me to train/guide their hikes?,25925,Not the A-hole,728,canwj2,1562635105.0,"First up please know I am trying my best to be kind in my wording. I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.

I got an inquiry for a group called ""Womens+ Adventures"" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.

The group wanted to work up to ""A 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

When I arrived for our first group hike, I learned ""Womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

The first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

After we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.

Please, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

I refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

When my daughter turned 4 months old, he married his current wife. I met my husband when my daughter was 2 years old and married him when she turned 3. My daughter is now 7 years old and I have a 3 year old son with my husband. My ex has two daughters with his wife, who are 6 and 4. 

My ex has an every other weekend visitation with our daughter. Now my daughter used to call my husband 'popi' , but ever since the birth of my son, my daughter has started calling my husband 'daddy'. That's what I call my husband when I address him in front of my son, and my daughter has kind of picked up on that. 

We never told her no, because my husband loves my daughter and thinks of her as his own. He has stayed up nights taking care of her the times she has been sick.

Now, she doesn't have the same relationship with her stepmother. She has always called her stepmother by her actual first name, and it has always been that way, even though her stepmother has known her for a longer time than my husband. 

Here's why I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. 

The other night, when me and my husband went to pick up my daughter from her dad's, my daughter ran out of their door happily saying ""mommy and daddy are here, I'm going home!""

When my ex heard her address my husband as 'daddy', he turned visibly upset. Later when we got home, my ex blew up on my phone saying that I was emotionally abusing my daughter by 'making' her call another man ""daddy"" and that I needed to make her stop.

 I said that our daughter has all the right to call my husband daddy if it makes her happy. He then asked me how I'd feel if he made our daughter call his wife ""mommy"". I told him that if my daughter hasn't called her "" Mommy "" after 6 years of knowing her, it is because she never wanted to. I said that it isn't my fault if our daughter feels closer to her stepfather and actually loves our family together. After saying that, I hanged up. 

The next day my ex mother in law called me accusing me of parental alienation. This is honestly messing with my mind. 

My husband loves my daughter. Is it really bad if we let her call him ""daddy""?. He loves it and in fact, he always says that he has 2 kids.",True,1577476905.0,2019-12-27 17:04:18

The teacher (M50) is a very friendly man, but his sense of humour is kind of on the edge of acceptable. He'd been making sex jokes about me and some other girls in my class all year, but they were still kind of funny. 

Last week he called me from the other side of the room saying his friend sent him a video and it made him think of me, as a joke. I approached  him and he gets the video out, everyone else was busy doing their thing. He showed me the video and skips through it. It was a lesbian orgy porn. I got super uncomfortable and froze. I couldn't do anything but chuckle in shock. I laughed it off, didn't say anything about it and went back to what I was doing. I know I should've said something then but I just couldn't. 

It's been making me lose sleep since last week. I feel grossed out, objectified and my self worth has plummeted. 

So today I decided to call someone at school who I trust. I told her what happened and that I wanted to arrange a meeting with witnesses where I tell him that he crossed a boundary. But she said she wanted to tell his boss and get an investigation started.

AITA for catfishing my underaged sister on Tinder and humiliating her in order to teach her a lesson?,25790,Asshole,5379,cn7li5,1565222196.0,"Last week, I was using my sister Ashley’s phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend’s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she’s on tinder (she’s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said “none of your business” 

I decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she’s just swiping for fun?) so I didn’t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he’d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

I created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister’s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she’s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. 

I decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could “head to my place afterwards”. She was completely receptive and said she’d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

After she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for “Jim”. My dad went up to her and said “Jim’s not coming” and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger’s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. 

I told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a “fucking dick” and “cruel” to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who’s right and if I went too far?

EDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would’ve had sex with Jim. That’s why I went the extent that I did.

Alright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I’m TA. But I’m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder.

AITA for not letting my sister see her kids?,25773,Not the A-hole,1599,g6zfpa,1587720803.0,"I (28f) obtained custody of my sister's (35f) kids (9m,4f,2f), back in 2018, after she left them alone for two weeks to go on a ""trip"" (read. drug bender). Of course this was a huge transition for the kiddos, they had to be moved schools and daycares, and of course couldn't see their mom anymore. Now, the kids are doing better and definitely lead happier lives. 

Recently, though, my sister was released from prison, and wants to see the kids again. She called me, begging to have a visit with them, and telling me that I could give them back because she was out of prison now. 

I've had a talk with the 9 year old, and he says that he doesn't want to see his mom yet, and that he still hates her for leaving him alone. The girls have no memories of her, and the smallest one was only three months old the last time she saw her.

I do feel like I could have helped them foster a better relationship with her, but I don't want to force the oldest into meeting her when he absolutely doesn't want to.

Still, my close family has told me that the oldest doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's my fault the little ones don't remember their mother because I didn't take them to see her when she was in prison. They also told me that it's my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don't want to, because that's what's best for them and they shouldn't grow up without their mother.

So, AITA?

My father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a ""kid"" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


So I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


When my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


I put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money.

AITA for turning off the wifi when my husband camps in the bathroom for extended lengths of time.,25748,Not the A-hole,4591,elpvjj,1578499783.0,"My husband and I are the parents of twins who are less than a year old. Anytime my husband SHOULD be doing something with the children ( it's his turn for a diaper, a bottle, even just soothing a fussy newborn) he ALWAYS goes to the bathroom first. We are both on maternity / paternity leave currently.

My husband is on medication that makes him spend a lot of time in the bathroom about an hour after a meal. It's a medication he has been on and off several times over the past year. He is never on it for more than a few weeks, and it does not effect him all the time, but he always claims that is why he is in the bathroom. ( I did ask, the doctor didnt say it was impossible, but highly unlikely. Doc wanted him to come in for a checkup if this was the case and husband said oh it's not THAT bad and refuses to go in )

I would rather let him use the restroom first than have to put down a baby mid task, but over the past couple months he has been spending more and more time in there. He always takes his phone. He is always watching youtube. His average session is 25 minutes in there, often longer, rarely shorter.

It's the most frustrating when it comes time to feed them ( one of the twins needs to be held specifically for health reasons, so I can not double feed ) because we will get up, I will warm up bottles, change one baby bum, get the first one fed, burped, and laid down in their crib, get the other baby changed and be setteling down to feed baby number two before he can be bothered to emerge and figure out why one child has been screaming because they had to watch their sibling eat l, and then the other when cry when they dont get to cuddle at all because I have to immediately set them down to feed the hysterically sobbing child. 

Yesterday was a week and a half sence I started truly keeping track, and he, only twice in 10 days, not ditched me to go camp out in the bathroom and let me finish %80 of the childcare.

Today I started a new rule. If he is in the bathroom for more than 10 minutes, I flip the wifi off. He has not spend more than 15 minutes in the bathroom at a stretch today, but is extremely upset. I feel like the fact that without the wifi his uncontrollable toilet issue cleared up rather quickly proves why it needs to be done, but he feels I am being unreasonable, and I need to make sure sleep deprivation isnt makeing me an asshole.

TLDR: AITA for turning off the wifi when my husband is in the bathroom for extended periods of time, avoiding domestic and fatherly duties.

Edit: to answer questions that people have been asking.

Yes, I have talked to him about this. 10 days ago we had a conversation about the situation, and he denied how long hes been spending in the bathroom. This conversation is also the one where I proposed he see a doctor.

Yes he has down time. He spends a good deal of time working on his car and plahs diablo about 8 hours straight every day. He spends most of his time on the other side of the house on his PC in his office.",True,1578499187.0,2020-01-08 08:09:43

I was diagnosed with terminal cancer 3 months ago and I don't have very long left (two months at most) I have accepted that I'm going to die but now I have to think about what's best for my son.

I had to decide who my boy would go to and I thought my mother(55) naturally but then I started to think of her situation as my older(29) lives with her along with his 5 kids all aged under 5 and I decided not to as mum works and my brother tbh isn't really raising his kids, more dragging them up and can be neglectful. I wasn't going to put my son in that environment as I want someone to actually care for him. So I then thought of my aunt(33) on my dads side. she is a good mother and her husband a good father to their 3 girls and I know they could provide for my son. I asked them and they agreed.

My mother however found out that I wasn't leaving my son with her and she got angry with me, that she's loosing me and now loosing her grandson. I gave her my reasons and that she realistically can't raise him while she's basically raising a man-child and his kids. It all ended in an even bigger argument and now I'm cooling off at home.

My wife and I usually decorate on Black Friday, but this year I don't want to.  The thought of putting up our fake tree knowing I'll have nothing to put under it fills me with such a mix of shame, anger, and pain.  I would prefer to just let December pass and cut out as many things as I can until I can get my finances under control.  Plus, my daughter is 2. She won't know, care, or even remember one missed Christmas.  So, AITA?  I'm already a failure as a husband and father, so what say you here?

THIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love and support that I in no way deserve or can accept.

INFO (And I am so sorry for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help. 

As for all the people begging me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her ""stuff"".  She already has ""stuff"".  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with ""stuff"".  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me.

Update for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die.

Update for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to ""retire"" and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week ""preschool"" for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and ""bless"" me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone.

Lastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.  

I still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough.


UPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids, we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts to your local charities. I have more than enough ""things"" and taking things from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on ""giving"" generously this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a ""new tradition"" that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded.

To those of you who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and ""not bothered to budget for it once it came"" are greatly underestimating how much fertility treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare really is.  We are taking steps to ensure that this kid will be our last, and I actually brought up abortion but my wife would not even consider it.

AITA for telling my friend to find her own hobbies and interests instead of just copying whatever her current boyfriend is into?,25540,Asshole,3460,cusnpp,1566677541.0,"Title says it all. My friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. Last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn’t realize gaming could be so expensive. She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn’t even have Candy Crush on her phone.

So I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn’t do it).

After dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn’t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

AITA?

AITA for yelling at a lady who was looking into my windows to stalk her son?,25498,Not the A-hole,2173,d6nm9s,1568971406.0,"I'm 19f and live at home with my family. My younger brother 'Mike' is 14. He is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. The boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their parents are hella weird. They have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. My mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""I saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""They were in our garden 5 minutes ago I think now they're headed to the skate park"". I think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.

One of the moms in the chat is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'Jake' is there. We once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.
 
Now yesterday I was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. Jakes mom had called my phone two times but I didn't answer cause she was annoying me. My boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. We were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. It was all nice and peaceful and suddenly I hear a really loud knock. It really made us jump because it was just so sudden. I turn to look and there's Jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. I nearly hit the ceiling I was so angry. I go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt I just wanted to ask because I haven't seen Jake in almost two hours ect.ect. Apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. I really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. I also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.

My boyfriend thought I was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other parents are now blowing up her phone. She also thinks I shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  I feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but I feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",False,1578343841.0,2019-09-20 02:23:26
UPDATE - AITA for allowing my 8 year old to shave her head?,25485,UPDATE,1015,gmrbbk,1589932776.0,"[My original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g43da4/aita_for_allowing_my_8_year_old_daughter_shave/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So many of you guys said that I am NTA. The people who told me I was TA said that because she would regret that decision.

We shaved her head almost a month ago. Just a few nights ago she asked me to shave it again for her since she really liked it. I was more than happy to do it.

I do plan on buying her a wig or two off of Amazon before she goes back to school in case she regrets it and wants to wear it to school but take it off at home.

I just want to make it clear - my husband's side of the family (her dad) was fully supportive (after all, her cousin inspired her to do it) I'm also spending less on shampoo and conditioner (she had super long hair)

As for my side of the family who was upset about it - some of them had a change of heart after she talked to them herself and told them that she was really happy with her decision. The other few think that she was forced to say she was happy, but I don't care.

My mom, who was the one who forwarded the picture to my family, apologized. She told me she did it because she thought she looked adorable but should have asked me first. But she was supportive of us.

My daughter wants me to let everyone know that if you really want to shave your head, just do it. According to her, she loves the way it feels on her pillows (she has silk pillowcases) and she liked feeling the shower and rain on her head.",False,False,2020-05-19 16:59:36
UPDATE: AITA for asking my grieving husband if he has feelings for his best friend?,25420,UPDATE,989,h9nwwg,1592280812.0,"I thought I’d give an update for all the kind people who asked for one. The original post, with a few details in the comments: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g3nb4y/aita\_for\_asking\_my\_grieving\_husband\_if\_he\_has/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g3nb4y/aita_for_asking_my_grieving_husband_if_he_has/)

So, as you all suggested I sat husband down and asked if he was okay, if he had the time and mental space to talk to me, etc. I apologised for what I implied- said it was inappropriate, irrelevant, and it wasn’t my place to say anything on his relationship with B.

But then he broke down, to my confusion, and started apologising to me. Said he DID have feelings for B, that I’m not delusional and stupid, that he’s just been gaslighting me (I disagree). Not going to give all the details, but hubby found out after B’s death that B had feelings for him - and it turned out to be mutual, to his shock. He said the sudden loss and what he realised basically made him go into a very dark place where he felt unworthy of everyone, including his children, B, and I. He needed to talk about it but was terrified of losing us.Knowing my husband, I kind of saw it coming and regret that he’s only confessed to it now because I never would’ve resented him for loving someone. And B’s gone. It’s just a lot of heartbreak for everyone.

So… I insisted on therapy again and husband agreed. And he’s okay, thankfully. He did have way too much on his plate but he’s already faring much better now that he’s finally opened up. I wouldn’t blame anyone for being trapped in a cycle of self-hate after all of this. He also mentioned his parents’ deaths too, very briefly. This all felt liberating because we finally came back to our before, where we’d share and discuss everything freely.

One surprise though, is that I ended up being diagnosed. *I am* depressed. TBH, I’m still puzzled because I come from a traditional Asian family where depression is a myth. But I guess I’d never questioned myself because I was just always too busy to. Parents abandoned me when I was 5, became a barrister at 21, worked 80 hours/week, taking care of my kids, charity work…You know what's the funniest part? I’m extremely lazy. Every second I *fight* the urge to lie down somewhere and sleep forever. I have these random moments where I question the relevance of it all but they all seem insignificant in light of everything I could lose. I’m okay. I never felt like reaching a breaking point. My husband has been feeling guilty - so I slapped some sense into him and told him I’m not cancerous.

We also had a talk with the kids. My oldest has been radiant since then. Youngest also likes to follow my husband around like a baby chick now. I’ve become an in-house counsel, so twice as less work hours, which is really cool too haha.

Yeah, idk. A lot of changes but none of them feel overwhelming! Life might be a bitch (esp now) but I feel grateful. Yes, I sound like a cheesy moron.

Thank you so much for your help, everyone!

AITA For walking out of my father's funeral?,25383,Not the A-hole,1006,gs4smm,1590695236.0,"Thowaway account for obvious reasons.

Important info:

- I'm a caucasian F, early 30's. Married to a lovely mixed M and we have a 2yr old.

- I've cut contact with my family about 5yrs ago, mostly due to my mother's narcissistic behaviour and her being pretty darn racist (she hated me dating my now husband), and the rest of my family condoning the crap she put us up with. 

- Most of my other relatives cut ties withwith my family before I was born or shortly after, I'm thinking it's once again because of my mother. The only one that kept in touch was one aunt, from my father's side.

This happened yesterday.


Last friday I got a call from my aunt that my dad got into an accident 2 days prior and didn't make it (he died on impact apparently). She asked me if I'd heard anything from my family, to which I replied 'no' (important to know that I've been using the same cellphone number and email since I was 18 or so). She figured they forgot and asked me if I wanted to come to the funeral. After a few minutes of thinking I told her I'd come if my family was okay with it and if SHE wanted me to, I explained to her that I wouldn't be going for myself or my father/family, just to support her. She said she'd want me there as she'd have no other support and called me later to tell me my family was okay with me coming.

So, yesterday was the day of the funeral. The past few days I did not hear a single thing from my family. When I got to the location my family members jumped right on top of me, telling me how happy they were that I came/that we should go to dinner/told me all kinds of stories about thing that happened the last 5yrs........they basically acted like those 5yrs didn't happed and we weren't there for a funeral. I know grieve does things to people, so I let it slide and played along, but it made me feel really uneasy and I made sure not to give any details about my own family or job, as they know nothing about that and I wanted to keep it that way as it was not the time and place for an argument about my husband.
During the ceremony they insisted I sat next to my mother. Everything started out okay, but when it was time for speeches, my family insisted I'd speak. I quietly told them no, that I had nothing prepared, but they didn't accept it. So I got up and quickly said 'he'll be missed' and sat down again. They visibly were not happy with me and my mother started shouting at me, telling me I was a worthless bitch, that I'd always treated them without any respect and that I was a bicth for not giving an actual speech about how amazing my father was in front of the +150 people that had shown up.

So, I looked at her for a few seconds, mostly trying to figure out wth just happened..........stood up, told her to enjoy the rest of her day and walked out.

My husband told me I did the right thing and he was proud of me for keeping my cool instead of starting a shouting match, so is my aunt........but I've been bombarded with messages from people that say I went too far. AITA?",False,1590666632.0,2020-05-28 12:47:16

I had no calls or texts from her, all I hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. This year I suffered a near-death accident. After it, I did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways I decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people I am close with. 

So for this year, I posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my FB. It was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). I wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me.""

A few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. She asked if I  loved her or if I wanted to get a divorce. She told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my FB. Of course I love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so I felt guilty and took down the post. Was I out of line here?

Here, mail doesn't deliver on weekends, they only do that Monday to Friday, which means I had 2 days worth of mail in my mailbox. 

My 30 something year old neighbours moved in on Friday when I wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when I was collecting my mail. She goes ""Don't check your mailbox on weekends. They don't deliver on weekends. So don't check it."" (In a rude Karen voice, if you know then you know.) Already, I know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and I'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so I said ""I know, it's just I've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so I had to check the mailbox."" I don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. 

She seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. Then we both went inside and that was that. About 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking I was held captive in my basement which I don't have, so I explained to them what I had said and they just laughed and left.

Just before, I was putting rubbish in the bin and she came out and called me a c*nt for making her think I was kidnapped

I didn't think much of it, but she came back exactly 3 hours later after both of them finished looking sad.

That conversation was supposed I will be private we had promised our kids that we will respect their privacy and do our best to help them when they need it.

I made her confess to our kids and told her. They were heartbroken and they hate her. She claims that it’s my fault but she dug her own grave. 

Both of them feel betrayed and don't want anything to do with their mother. So Reddit am I the asshole for forcing a confession??

Minor update:

Hey so many of you wanted an update, but it’s too soon to tell what will actually happen.
As of now my soon to be ex-wife is staying at a friends house. I did receive some calls from her and her friends about how I’m an asshole but after I explained everything to her friends they apologised and sided with me.

My kids do want a divorce but I feel as tho she has already put that plan into motion. I’m not too worry as I am able to afford better lawyers than her. My kids are actually grateful that I did what I did because they now realised that their mom is a control freak. Funny enough a friend had found the post after a mutual friend told them and showed it to my wife.

AITA for showing my boyfriend my used sanitary towel in an argument?,25232,Not the A-hole,3715,fbv7ty,1583103932.0,"Title sounds gross I know, maybe it is a bit gross.

Background: me (F23) and boyfriend (m22) have been together for 6 months, good relationship, healthy sex life that we talk about a lot and communicate our needs etc. A month ago I had the implant fitted (contreception) which has given me weird frequent periods. The doctor told me they should go back to normal in a few months and to wait it out, which I'm doing because I like the convenience of the implant. English isn't my first language so sorry for any bad writing.

We were in bed yesterday night watching TV and he went to initiate sex. I moved his hand away and said I was still on my period. My period had been going for about a week now so we'd not had sex in that time. Then my boyfriend made a really loud dramatic sigh and moved away from me. I said 'sorry, I can't help my periods.'

He replied 'yeah sure.' I said what was that suppose to mean? He wouldn't give me a straight answer and kept saying 'whatever'.

We didn't talk for a while and kept watching TV in silence. Then he said 'if you don't want to have sex you can just say you know.'

I was kind of pissed off at this because I felt like he was saying I was faking being on my period. I told him I really was still on my period. He said no periods last longer than a week, and I told him that the doctor had said this was normal for some people on the implant at first and it will settle.

He told me that he didn't believe me and so I called him an idiot (which wasn't nice I know). He then started ranting that how could I call him an idiot when I was clearly a liar who must be cheating on him and getting sex elsewhere which is why I am lying about my periods. I couldn't believe he was saying this because he's never freaked out on me like this. Cheating has also never ever been mentioned in our relationship ever so I don't know where this came from. It annoyed me so much that I got out of bed and pulled my trousers and pants down so he could see my sanitary towel that was bloody and shouted Could I fake this??

He screamed that I was fucking disgusting and left the room. I started laughing because of the ridiculous of the situation and that pissed him off more, as he grabbed his keys and stormed out of the house.

I tried to text him but he ignored me, so I left him to it as I was pretty annoyed by his behaviour. I then got a text a few hours later around 11pm from his sister saying he had gone to his mom and dad's house and told his sister what happened. She said what I had done was really disgusting and he's refusing to come back unless I apologise. I told my friend what happened and she said he was being an idiot but that I also needed to apologise because what I did was 'abhorrent'.

I'm annoyed with what he did but also think it was pretty gross of me to do that. I don't really know why I did it it was just a spur of the moment thing. So AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Just wanted to offer an update. This has really changed my perspective on things. I think I was so thinking about the sanitary towel thing that I hadn't really realised how bad his behaviour was. 

His mom actually sent me a message on facebook saying what I did was disgusting and really abnormal and that she doesn't think me and my boyfriend should date anymore. I can't believe his mom is messaging me about this. I blocked her and messaged him that he needs to come and pick up his stuff that he's left at mine. Luckily it isn't much. He hasn't replied but I saw that he has shared a post on facebook about women being crazy. So I guess we're done.

AITA for not speaking to my parents again after they put my cat down,25142,Not the A-hole,2306,fdyy9z,1583459174.0,"For context: I'm 28, the vets office is literally 10 minutes away.

I had them take him because I have two herniated disks and can't carry the carrier and open the multiple doors and hold the carrier without fear of dropping it.  I thought he had a little cold with the only reasoning being that his ears felt a little warm, he wasn't eating as much as he normally does and he was due for his shots anyway. So I cooked dinner for all of us while they took him to the vet on my dime. I called them after an hour and asked how things were going and my father told me everything was good and he had a little fever. Fast forward another hour, they come back and let themselves in and I open the door to my mother sobbing and my father slinking in the corner. Turns out the vet found a large mass on his Kidney and suspected it was stage 3-4 cancer. So my parents, without calling me, had him put down to ""spare my feelings"".

I told them both to leave and that I never wanted to speak to them again. That it wasn't their decision to make and they should have called and told me the situation so I could at the very least say good bye and be with him. That by failing to tell me, they stole an opportunity for any closure I could have. I raised that cat from a feral kitten with his mother and his brother from the time he had his eye's open. He was only 10.

I'm equally heart broken and furious and they can't seem to understand why. They proceeded to berate and belittle me, going as far as to say I wasn't sad, just angry and that I was: ""ruining a beautiful and tragic moment"" and that it was my fault because I didn't go with them. Edit: As just to be clear the never wanting to see them again bit was after this attempt to make me feel bad for being angry.

Am I the asshole here?

Edit: I'm turning off reply notifications. 99% of you can form a reasonable response, NTA/YTA/ETA. I'm just sick of the ""YTA because it was just a cat"" people, who are clearly miserable assholes themselves. I hope they never have a pet for that pet's sake.

AITA for letting my nephew to call me mom?,25083,Not the A-hole,2009,g9t0d6,1588128554.0,"Awhile back, my brother married a woman who had an 11 year old son named ""Billy"". A year later my SIL gave birth to a little girl. Two years later, she gave birth to a boy. Billy, who was 14 by this time, was treated like an outsider. My SIL and brother saw him as a burden who spoiled their picture perfect family. If you asked my SIL how many kids she had, she would say two. Billy started acting out. He got involved with a bad group of kids and started getting into trouble. He started failing all of his classes. He eventually got into drugs and was suspended from school. My brother and SIL were fed up with him.

I asked my brother if Billy could spend the summer with me and my husband. We have a hobby farm and I thought maybe getting away from his life for awhile could help him some. Well, they were more than happy to get rid of him (my SIL's words). It was kind of rough the first few weeks. He had a lot of anger issues. But my husband kept his hands and mind busy doing work on the farm. And we both made sure that he knew he was loved and wanted. By August, he was a totally different kid. He wanted to keep living with us but my SIL insisted that he come home. After two months, he went back to his old ways due to his parents indifference. They ended up sending him back to us and he lived with us throughout high school. He ended up being an A/B student and kept with a really great group of kids. He got involved in baseball and got a scholarship to a local university. He's 22 now and is in his last year of school. He's engaged to a really great girl.

When he was 16 he started calling me Mom and he started calling my husband Pops. He never really had much to do with his mom and he had nothing to do with my brother. He saw them on holidays when the whole family came over. His mom has tried to have a relationship with him the past few years but he has avoided her. On Christmas, SIL was over and for what ever reason, she opened my desk drawer and found a birthday card from Billy where he said ""To the best mom ever. Thanks for loving me and giving me a chance."" She was devastated. She ended up texting Billy, confronted him and asked him if she would be presented as mother of the groom at his wedding. He told her that he no longer considered her his mom and wasn't even sure if he wanted her at the wedding at all.

My SIL is now insisting that I make it clear to Billy that I am not his mother and that he is not to refer to me as such. My brother is also very upset with me. Even my parents are pressuring me to do what SIL wants for the sake of peace. Honestly, I consider Billy to be my son. I count him in with all of my children. I feel like telling Billy not to present me as mother of the groom could possibly be misinterpreted as me saying that I don't feel like he's my son and I don't even want to take a chance of that happening. If he decides to present his real mom as mother of the groom, I will 110% support him. So AITA for not respecting my SIL's wishes?

Edited to add: I have zero desire to tell Billy not to call me mom and I absolutely won't do it because I know it would destroy him and it would kill me. My SIL insists that by not doing it, I'm making it impossible for her to have a relationship with him and I'm being selfish. I have talked to Billy about it some. He doesn't like to talk about his mom at all. He basically just said that he doesn't see her as a mom and has for sure decided he doesn't want her at the wedding. I understand and respect that.

"AITA for telling my mother that my step dad will not be walking me down the aisle because I hate him, and in turn ripping my family apart?",24956,Not the A-hole,2512,ekwwcq,1578359160.0," 

I (23) am getting married to my boyfriend of 6 years in June. We're having quite a large wedding (fiance has a big family, and we have a lot of friends), but my family is very small. My only family is my mom (never met my dad), and I have an aunt and uncle who are childfree. Since I was little, having no father I always wanted my uncle to walk me down the aisle.

My mom married my step dad when I was 12, and I've never liked him. He's a bully. He says horrible things to people, says racist, sexist, transphobic things for attention, and heavily contributed to my mental illness and eating disorder as a teenager. My mom knows that we don't get along, and she knows I didn't like him, but I gave up on confiding in her about how much I disliked him when I was around 15, because she would always insist that despite having a nasty mouth, he was a really good guy and he would never hurt us. So, it's been around 8 years since I've told my mom I hate him. I moved out when I was 19 with my boyfriend. I visit my mom maybe 3-4 times a week, I would try to time this around my step dad working so I wouldn't see him. As a result of seeing him less, I was more able to ignore his horribleness and we stopped arguing. I mostly stopped talking to him. He still refers to me as his daughter and my mother insists he loves me. It is not mutual, but everyone has assumed that I love him too and our relationship is just based on 'banter' rather than tormenting.

So, when I got engaged, I asked my uncle almost straight away if he would walk me down the aisle. He was over the moon, but my aunt was like 'oh, you aren't picking step dad?' and I said no, I've always wanted uncle to do it. A few hours later, my mom called me crying asking why I wouldn't want step dad to do it, saying it's broken his heart. I told her that I've always dreamed of having uncle do it. She pressed on about how heartbroken he is, saying he always thought we had a good, funny relationship. This is where I feel like an ass. I said, 'there was nothing funny about him ruining my self esteem and teenage years. I hate him and if it were up to me, he wouldn't even be at the wedding'. My mom said that she's horrified that I still feel this way, once again spouting that he's a good guy and he loves me. I repeated that I hate the guy, and she said she'll tell him to back off.

He's now angry at me and has asked my uncle not to walk me. My uncle is now not speaking to him, and I feel like I've torn what little family I have apart. AITA?",False,False,2020-01-06 17:06:00
"AITA for giving my child a ""culturally inappropriate"" name?",24950,Not the A-hole,4794,el460c,1578390209.0,"I am black, and my wife is also black. I spent my most of my childhood in the foster system, but for a good part of it I was taken care of by an elderly Russian gentleman (we'll call him Dimitri Petrovitch). While he never formally adopted me, he played a major role in my upbringing, and I am very grateful for all that he has done for me. Unfortunately, he passed away many years ago, and he never had any children. 

Fast forward to today, my wife and I recently had a son, and to honor the memory of my mentor, I decided (with my wife's approval) to name my kid Dimitri Petrovitch Williams. Williams being my last name, and Petrovitch being my son's middle name. However, it seems like it's only my wife and I who likes this name, as her extended family has been quite upset over it, saying things like ""What kinda name is Dimitri?"", or ""You ain't white, you ain't Russian, why did you give your son such as a white name."" 

It's true that there's no part of me that's Russian (I an barely speak Russian), but I feel like he's been such a big part of my upbringing that I had to honor him somehow. I confided in my friends too, and they said something along the lines of ""You a black man and you gotta be proud of your own culture. You gave your son an identity that he's not even a part of, he's gonna have a hard time in school with that name.""

So my wife's family aren't happy with our decision, and it seems like my friends don't really have my back either. I'm keeping the name that's for sure, but should I have reconsidered? Maybe I could've honored my mentor in another way?",False,False,2020-01-07 01:43:29
AITA for asking a neighbor if she wanted to share food?,24934,Asshole,5966,dp37p9,1572447779.0,"I'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. I've lived there for 6 years. My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (I actually don't know her first name but I'll call her Katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

So I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great.

This is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food.

I asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

Overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

So, AITA?

EDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

EDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. Thanks.",True,1572440884.0,2019-10-30 08:02:59

My stepdaughter is living with my husband and I for the next year. Shes an educated young professional who’s saving up to buy her own home. 

Since she’s moved in with us (past 3 months) she’s become increasingly snappy and unhappy with how her dad and I run our lives. We aren’t environmentally conscious enough because we don’t compost our waste, we are negligent because we leave lights on when we leave our home for security reasons, we should switch to electric cars, we are contributing to the inhumane treatment of cows by consuming dairy, the list is endless. 

My cat Mango is getting to be an old ass man and he has lived a full life of eating whatever the fuck he likes (obviously within what’s safe for a cat) and hes happy that way. My stepdaughter is now insisting she will purchase vegan cat food because seeing Mango eat meat makes her sick. 

We feed him in the kitchen and she will literally throw up / retch/ leave the kitchen if she sees him eat meat. She HAS lost a lot of weight since claiming that seeing Mango eat meat makes her sick, and we leave out dry biscuits for him to snack on which also makes her sick. It’s not like we leave mess out but even if she smells his food in the am (which is gross, yeah, but the doors are open and that’s just life if you have a pet) she will heave and walk away. 

Her dad and I both told her if she’s unhappy with it she needs to find someplace else to live and although we are genuinely sorry she’s lost her appetite and has lost weight we aren’t going to change Mangos lifestyle- she has yelled, cursed at us, cried, begged, etc, but no, we are NOT happy with Mango eating a vegan diet. We don’t feed him cheap crap either, we feed him food quality cat food that isn’t processed or full of sugar or grain. It’s pretty much gourmet Gordon Ramsey worthy cat food. 

My MIL has waded in after my stepdaughter told her we were being unfair by refusing to let Mango go on her preferred diet for him, and is accusing us of being cruel and shortsighted.

I wouldn’t get bacon on my fries otherwise, but I would rather do that than set a precedent of my friend stealing my food. When I first sat down at our table, he said “What the fuck man? Why’d you do that?” My friends sided with him. They said I went too far by not “respecting” his dietary restrictions. Too which I replied, “his dietary restrictions shouldn’t matter if he doesn’t eat my food”.

AITA for cutting off my family over my mom's will?,24823,Not the A-hole,1645,gersvf,1588825526.0,"I always suspected my mom preferred my sister over me.  Growing up, she spoiled my sister with whatever she wanted and took her word over mine whenever we argued.  I was always in second place compared to her.  For example, when we turned sixteen, I was given my aunt's old clunker that ended up dying within six months.  When my sister turned sixteen, she got the brand new red Volkswagon of her dreams.  Mom said that I couldn't continue my piano lessons because they were getting so expensive while still supporting my sister's dance lessons, competions, etc.  

Things got really bad about a decade ago.  When we were in high school, I feel in love with this guy, Joey, and started dating him for a while.  Only to for him to dump me because he preferred my sister.  Yes, my sister seduced him.  This really broke me because he was my first love.  

Well, my sister and Joey ended up getting married after their college graduation.  And that is when things went from bad to worse.  Our mother had her will made and she was leaving everything to my sister.

For background information, our childhood home was a two story building, where my mother's flower shop was on the ground floor and the apartment we grew up in was the second floor.  While I didn't get along with my mom or sister, I loved that flower shop and had been working there for most of my life.  I dreamed of owning that shop one day.

But instead, my mother was going to leave the building, the shop and the apartment, to my sister.  While I could still work in the shop, my sister would be the owner and I would have to do what she says.  There was no use in trying to convince her to change her mind.  In her mind, my sister was the married one with a baby on the way.  She needed the business and house to raise her family.  Meanwhile, I was single and had nothing.

So, I cut them off.  If my mother didn't see me as a family member, then I wanted nothing to do with them anymore.  It was clear who she favored more.  So I moved out of my childhood home and was on my own.  Less than a year later, I joined the Peace Corps and have been living abroad since.

Now, to the present.  After not hearing from them for years, my sister found me on social media and reached out to me.  She wanted to talk to me, rekindle whatever relationship we had.  I told her no, that I never wanted to talk to her or have anything to do with her or our mother again.  She then starts to write this angry message about how I could do this to her and why would I turn my back on her.

But as far as I am concerned,  she is not my family.  She hasn't been family in a decade.  My partner and our baby is family.  I have a new, happier, more fulfilling life in South Africa than I ever did back in the States.  I don't want to ever see my old family again because of how they treated me.  I don't want them to meet my daughter.  If I let them back into my life, I am afraid they will ruin the new life I made for myself.

AITA for banning everyone who critiques our parenting from meeting our son?,24792,Not the A-hole,3513,e0muyw,1574566709.0,"My wife has minor anxiety and ocd. She has been on meds for a long time, but had to go off them when she got pregnant. None of the pregnancy safe meds worked for her. Pregnancy was really tough for her, she spent a lot of time reading about what foods and activities and such could harm a fetus, and she was basically paralyzed by fear that she was hurting our son whenever she did anything. It was really rough for her and she hated being pregnant. She had a mental breakdown and confessed to me that she didn’t want to breastfeed, she was feeling violated by the pregnancy and wanted her body back and to go back on her meds, but she was worried that our son would be terribly harmed if she didn’t. I talked her out of breastfeeding because the pros were far outweighed by the cons and she clearly didn’t want to do it.

After the delivery, I was using the bathroom and my father was in the room with my wife. A lactation consultant came in and asked my wife if she was ready to breastfeed. My wife said she wasn’t going to breastfeed and the lactation consultant started pushing and reminding her of the benefits of breastfeeding (which to my wife, was reminding her of all the ways she was harming our son by not breastfeeding.) my father also started pressuring her. She said she just kept saying “I don’t want to,” but was very close to capitulating because she was so tired and anxious and she just wanted it to end. I came back into the room and kicked out the lactation consultant and my dad for not listening to her when she said no.

Things got considerably better when we left the hospital. My wife was able to get back on her meds and was happy. This was the first part of the pregnancy/birth process that she actually got to enjoy. Her meds can take up to a month or two to have full effect, so the anxiety and ocd issues are still there, but much less.

The conflict comes in because I told my dad he couldn’t be around my wife and son for the time being because he participated in pressuring her when she said no. I’ve also run into an issue when sending pictures of the baby to family. A number of people wrote back nitpicking how my wife my holding the baby, what she was feeding him, the crib we’re using and so on. I stopped sending photos, but my wife and I talked and she said she was still feeling fixated on everything she was doing wrong as a mom, and these critiques would make it worse.

So I told everyone who critiqued our parenting that they can’t come meet the baby. They probably can in a month or so when my wife will be more secure mentally and as a mom, but until then, no one can come. Thus far, the only people who have met my son are my wife’s parents, her sister, and my mom.

A lot of my family is saying that this is unfair because they have good intentions and are just trying to help. My mom told me I should give them a chance, but I think the risk is too big. Am I the asshole for banning them?",True,False,2019-11-23 19:38:29

The older daughter does not like me and makes it clear that she would rather her father not date me (or anyone else from what I gather). 

Boyfriend and his ex share custody and this year, since my boyfriend had them for Christmas, I got them both presents (got them both necklaces). 10 year old was very excited and happy with her gift. 13 year old got huffy and said she didn't want anything from me and refused to ""accept"" the gift. 10 year old also opened 13 year old's gift after she refused to accept it and I could tell that she did like what I'd got her. I decided to keep it for myself. 


Fast forward to today, 13 year old calls and she wants the necklace. She didn't apologise for her rude behaviour from before or anything (which I honestly don't care too much about). She asked me to give it to her since it's ""hers"" and ""you already bought it"". I told her that it wasn't hers since she refused to accept the gift and that I'm not going to give it ""back"" to her. She got upset and complained to my boyfriend who told her it was up to me whether or not I wanted to give her the gift anymore.

**Edit: ok, I did not expect this post to get so much attention. Just to clarify a few things that are being asked, I'm 27. No, this is not the first time I've got them gifts. I didn't write down my thought process properly; I've got them gifts before but they were ""experiences"" based gifts (for an example passes to amusement parks etc). This year because I was actually spending the day with them, I wanted to give a ""proper"" gift that they can actually keep and immediately ""have"" if that makes sense. And yes I kept it for myself, what else am I supposed to do with a rejected gift?** 

**Anyway..I realise that I did not handle this in the best way. I'll be seeing her today and explaining to her how I felt and why  didn't want to give it to her again and explain that perhaps we both could learn to appreciate the sentiment behind gifts better.I think I will decide what to do with the actual gift after having a proper conversation with her and seeing how that goes (especially since I already exchanged the necklace for a different one and no longer have the original one I got for her).

Maybe it’s stupid, but I want people to remember the person he was. My dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very Catholic funeral service. He wasn’t Catholic and wouldn’t like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn’t know there. He’d think it’s way too fancy, way too much. 

He and I had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, I guess). He told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while “It’s Raining Men” played in the background...obviously not an option....Also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like “Highway to Hell” and “Another One Bites the Dust.” 

To remember him, I want to bring a speaker and play “Another One Bites the Dust” at his wake. I would explain it to the people at the wake and say that I wanted to preserve the person he was. Maybe I could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. There will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren’t very familiar with him and are Catholic, so I’ve been thinking maybe not. But I really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. I think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it.

Edit: I didn’t really expect this response, but thank you. My brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. I swear, I almost sense his hand in it. I don’t know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

This morning, I talked to my dad about the wake. I suggested, as some of you did, that maybe I could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. I found a violin one that I really liked. My dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and I made. He actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. I hadn’t really been thinking about my Dad as much as I should have, I thought of him as opposition, I guess he cared way less about the Catholic stuff than I thought. 

I also reached out to some of my brother’ s friends. Some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. We are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we’re going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

Sorry if the answer seems obvious, but I've had so much backlash Im starting to question myself.

I am f25, my brother is m22. He lives with me since he moved out of our parents house, reasons are irrelevant. I came home to find him with his buddies in my home, getting wasted. I was pissed because he never asked if he could have people over (""Im an adult OP, I can do what I want""). Apparently he and his friends were throwing a ""bullet dodged"" party. 

He had been seeing this girl for a bit. She texted him letting him know that she was pregnant, but planning to abort the baby. She asked if he could financially help her pay for the operation. He. Blocked. Her. I was *horrified*. Apparently he and his brilliant friends decided that she had lied about taking birth control, because ""Its impossible for women to get pregnant if they're on the pill."" ….. right. 

I was livid. I was completely disgusted not only by their ignorance towards birth control and safe sex, but by the fact that he would block a girl and leave her completely on her own to handle a problem that he was at least 50% responsible for. I told him, in these exact words ""pack your shit and get the fuck out"" Obviously more than this has happened in the past, but this was my breaking point. I had tried so hard to bend over backwards for my baby brother. House him when he was homeless, help him get a job, give him rides... only for him to turn out like *that*? Nope. So anyways, he and his friends stood there like they didn't think I was serious. I said again, ""all of you get the fuck out. I don't want to see any of you here again.""

Here's where I'm possibly the asshole. I told him in no uncertain terms that he needed to collect his things and leave. If he was old enough to make big-boy decisions, he was old enough to find a place on his own. He straight up said no. So I lost my temper. I grabbed as much of his stuff as I could, crammed it into a suitcase, and put/threw the suitcase outside. I shouted that if he didn't leave I would call the police. Fast forward tears and begging, he was finally out. That night I got *several* messages that I was heartless for making him homeless. They pregnancy wasn't his fault because: 1) it was an accident. 2) they weren't a serious couple so he has no reason to help her. 3) she should have been more careful. I called bull, and said I would never allow someone with that sick mindset live under my roof. I said that he is not my brother and I don't want anything to do with him. My parents, my aunts, and some cousins are with me, but that leaves about 3/4 of the family against me. They think that I should support him because he is my brother, I should have given him time (he's not on the lease btw, and he was *supposed* to pay rent but often didn't), and the punishment just didn't fit the crime.

AITA for not telling my fiancée about a secret room in our apartment?,24584,Not the A-hole,3236,g3keje,1587228493.0,"I recognize the title sounds a little ridiculous. The situation is less so.

I was very fortunate to be in a position to buy an apartment straight out of college. It's a weird unit on a high floor of a weird building, but I've gut-renovated it and made it really nice.

One aspect of my home was created just to fulfill a childhood fantasy. A secret room! It's simple— a flush mount bookcase put in the doorway. It leads to what would otherwise be a windowless very large closet or a very small room.

I made it into a cute secret lair / reading nook, but with no windows... it never got used. Ended up being more long-term storage.

I never told anyone about it... because it was a secret room!

I kind of figured at one point I'd tell my girlfriend, Emma, but I didn't want to tell her until I had a *reason* to. (I had finished it shortly before meeting her.)

I figured maybe one day if we had a kid, I could remove the bookcase and bam, we'd have plenty of space to put in a changing table setup. Or a craft-nook for her.

But I largely forgot about it, except when I needed to pull something out from back there... which is rare.

**Fast forward to yesterday.**

Emma, now my fiancée, has been living with me in my (now our!) apartment for eight months.

During this time, I've kept the secret room... *a secret.*

It's not like I was thinking about it all the time. I only consciously did something sneaky maybe three times since she's moved in, to get christmas lights, a spare coffee maker, and to put away a novelty item she probably thought I threw out.

And the reason I was sneaky at those times was because again, I didn't want to waste the surprise on christmas lights!

We've both been working from home lately, and we aren't really able to leave very often, due to circumstances... And she jokingly announced we needed a new room to shake things up from her normal commute. (Bedroom to Living Room.)

So ***of course*** I excitedly pulled open our ""built-in"" bookshelf and showed her our room!

***...And she flipped out.***

She is furious at me. She sees me keeping this secret as a major betrayal of trust, given that this is her home. She's acting like I cheated on her. I tried to explain I was waiting for a special moment, but... she thinks that makes it worse.

I have no idea if she's being unreasonable or if I am. AITA?",True,False,2020-04-18 09:48:13

I knew from many stories I've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. This may sound immature but I made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that I was her only father and to not betray me. But I have no control over what she or they do in their home. Fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. She has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me I would be the one to do it. Even though I know they're very close, I don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. I am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. I got a bit angry and told her I absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy I barely know.

I told her I wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but I won't be there to see it.

AITA for not paying for the extra meal I accidentally ordered at a wedding?,24365,Not the A-hole,2579,d2cd5s,1568170484.0,"My sixteen year old son and I went to a wedding. When we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. There was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but I never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. I sent in the RSVP card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

At the wedding, my son and I got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. The waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. The waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

I later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that I had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. I told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. They said I should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that I should have asked for clarification if I wasn't sure. But I wasn't unsure, I never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. Ten and under I would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up I would never think would have a kid's meal. The bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but I've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. I think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old.

UPDATE: WIBTA if I took action about my husband's snoring?,24347,UPDATE,386,gm3kv9,1589844577.0,"My [previous WIBTA posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ensy36/wibta_if_i_took_action_about_my_husbands_snoring/) was pretty quiet, but I appreciated everyone who took the time to respond. I’m providing an update in hopes that maybe our experience will help internet strangers also dealing with this.

Based on the AITA feedback, I sat down with my husband to share my concerns about the sudden onset of his excessive snoring. I said I thought he may have developed sleep apnea, which could be serious. I encouraged him to  go see a doctor, stating that I would be willing to go with him. I also said  I would go to the guestroom if I was unable to sleep due to the  snoring.

After this conversation, nothing really changed and it made me very frustrated. There were a few  times when I retreated to the guestroom to try to sleep. The first time, I didn’t lock the door. He came in the room, immediately fell back asleep, and snored right in my face. I was PISSED and made it clear that if I was in the guestroom sleeping, it was because he was snoring and he was not to come in.

This pattern went on for a bit before everything blew up mid-April. I asked if he wanted to come for a walk with me and he said he would. Just a few minutes into the walk, he said I was walking too fast and taking it “too seriously."" I told him if he didn’t want to walk, he should just go home. He did and I finished my walk, fuming.

When I got home, I said we needed to talk. I told him first and foremost that I love him to bits, but I was not going to sugarcoat what I needed  to say. I reminded him that he used to be so active, as we used to hike and run together. Now, he had gone from being a healthy weight to overweight to obese. I reminded him of the earlier conversation about sleep apnea and asked if he had looked into the  causes of the condition. He admitted that he hadn’t. I said that while not all cases have the same cause, many times sudden snoring can be the result of weight gain or serious problems. I almost cried at this point, saying I was really worried about the long-term impact on his health if things didn’t change. I ended the conversation by saying that I realized that the beginning of a pandemic is a bad time to try to get healthy.

He had listened quietly the whole time before responding, “Or is it?” He thanked me for my honesty and acknowledged that he had not taken any of this seriously, but that he wanted to.

Although he didn't go see a doctor, he has been working out and eating well since that conversation. Yesterday he shared that he was down 15 pounds and his goal is to lose 20 more by the end of the summer. His snoring has pretty much stopped and we are both sleeping better. It wasn’t easy to have those talks, but I’m thrilled that he took the initiative to take care of himself and I no longer have to worry about sleeping in the spare room.",False,False,2020-05-18 16:29:37
AITA for asking my wife to have an abortion,24268,No A-holes here,2694,d0v6ir,1567886761.0,"My wife and I (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. We don't have any kids and don't want kids. We had the ""what if"" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.

Yesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. She's on the pill, but accidents happen. She said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. Naturally, I was surprised by the news and her change of mind. I asked her if she considered getting an abortion. She said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. She told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. I told her I wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. She started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. She wont answer my phone calls.

I'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. I was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. I know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but I can't help but have a negative view about it. A few years ago I tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but I couldn't. I was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. My wife is aware of these points.

I just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. I also don't like kids. My wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows I wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. I understand why she thinks that, but I still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little I would be involved in raising him or her.

AITA for asking my wife to have an abortion?

Edit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. If she ever wanted to stop taking it, I would support her 100%. I realize that I’m an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. It honestly never occurred to me until now (I think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). I see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. I’m going to get snipped ASAP.

Edit #2: She and I talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. Here are the main takeaways:

* I apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. I also apologized if she felt like I was pressuring her when I asked her to have an abortion. I didn't mean to pressure her, but I know words aren't always received as we intended. She said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows I was totally caught off guard.
* She apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. She said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes I don't feel like she tricked me (I don't).
* We mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. We've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",True,1567870736.0,2019-09-07 13:06:01
AITA for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?,24185,Not the A-hole,327,di6zz9,1571170320.0,"My former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. As a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so I was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. She (now Laura) has not started HRT yet but is living fulltime as a woman. Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

Ever since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. She's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. Laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

I am fine with what Laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. Recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

I tried to talk about this privately to Laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was. My son and I left in tears but Laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

Ever since then I've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and I was a bad person for asking Laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. I'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if I've gotten old and out of touch. It just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this.

The last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn’t want her boys to see it. 

Now it’s not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

Anyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. 

Now I’m back she’s started a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I’m on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

I personally think I absolutely should not be hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking it’s gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house I’m living in.

Edit: for more info, this isn’t a random house I’ve moved back into. I’ve lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons.

The story was this amazing fudge recipe came from her grandma who snagged it from a famous candy maker.  My mom didn't get the recipe until she was an adult and we were always told that we couldn't have it until we were 30. 

In my late teens my mom asked me to help make the fudge with her a few times. The recipe is very simple and this was all the exposure I needed to memorize it. I've never once needed to write the recipe down. 

It came out that I had the recipe early and my mom and her mom were both outraged. I was given many warnings against sharing family secrets and told they were disappointed at my sneaking around them. I've never shared the recipe with anyone besides my brother and sister. I don't have the same feelings about recipe hoarding, but I followed tradition. However even now, 15ish years later, I'll get comments about how they don't entirely trust me since I came by the recipe dishonestly. 

Tonight I was reading an article about a chef doing research on secret family recipes for pickled herring. He managed to get copies of hundreds of recipes-200 of them were identical. He traced them back to a cookbook from the 1960s. This got me thinking about our family recipe. 

After not much googling at all I found ""our"" exact recipe on the website for an evaporated milk company. They apparently have also printed the recipe on cans over the years. 

This leads me to believe that either my grandma or her mother actually got the recipe from a can and lied about it's origin.

Aita for giving all of my coworkers a different reason for why I have missing fingers?,24019,No A-holes here,3347,cw9hdj,1566963940.0,"I have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. It's fine. I can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days I can't, that's the dyspraxia). However, I won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. I only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.

I'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but I still find it annoying. I really don't get why you'd think it would be an OK thing to ask someone about, but hey. I wasn't raised in a barn. Usually I nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).

Anyway, I started a new job about a month ago, and I honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. I felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and I decided to make myself laugh. When the first new coworker asked about it, I completely lied and told her that I chewed them off as a baby. I then decided to tell the next person who asked that I cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that I was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. All genuinely ridiculous reasons but I'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. I didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. Maybe they just thought there's no way I'd lie about how I lost my fingers.

Within about 3 days, I learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. I'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3D printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. 

Anyway, I told this story to my brother today and he told me that I was an asshole because I caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. My argument is that I'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because I didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, I was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think I actually severed three fingers with dental floss when I was 3. I'll accept my judgement, though.

Update: gonna check out here, I think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. A few reminders for people: I'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.",True,1566999390.0,2019-08-27 20:45:40
AITA for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?,23972,Not the A-hole,940,c9gtj9,1562367090.0,"Necessary information: When my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. After a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. Except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

That was when my husband and I stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. When she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and I still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. Once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

Now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. He's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. My daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. Since I'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. I asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. I asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. I also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200B;

He thought of asking me because I had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". I told him that no, it was not. I was 42 then and I'm 59 now, I didn't had the health issues that I do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. Also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  I would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. Now he thinks I'm playing favorites and that I'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but I think I'm just being reasonable.

I disagree as it was not my intent and I never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. He's also very mad about being called an asshole. While he is my son, I find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone.

She tried to justify her but in the end also accepted that my sister was wrong. Non the less she told me to just give her space and that she will just come to terms with it herself.

I waited a few days till I met her in the supermarket. At first she tried to act like she didn't see me but I planted myself infront of her. She was just rolling her eyes saying she had places to be. And I just said ""you know I hope you notice how unfair you are treating me"" and then left her alone.

That night I received a call where I was berated for being selfish for about 20 minutes by her. I asked her if she was done and asked her if we could talk it out like adults. She came over the next night and we had an exhausting fight. Screaming crying and after all was said and done she actually apologized for everything. She was kind of jealous of my dress and of the wedding I almost had. And she was embarassed that she couldn't afford everything I could and that she felt like she failed as an adult and as a mother. And honestly I get it. Not because I think she is a failure, but because I get how it feels if your brain tells you you failed at life because you don't have things that other people have. She apologized also because she was trying to blame me for her problems and that everything was easier if she wasn't the one to blame. We talked a lot more time till I told her that she didn't need a fancy dress and that we could search something basic and I could help her to decorate it with something. She agreed and we actually did get to customize a very basic gown. As we didn't have much time it's not super fancy. Sadly due to the outbreak the wedding, that was supposed to happen this month, was canceled. They had a courthouse wedding where she wore one of my dresses and she is celebrating in August if it's possible.

That's everything. So even if I was not an asshole and my sister seemed like a brat... She was dealing with some heavy feelings and I still love her.

AITA for burning bridges with my in-laws at my husband's funeral?,23846,Not the A-hole,1814,fegt59,1583544367.0,"I married ""Jake"" when we both were 19 - I know in hindsight that that was dumb, but it was common in the area. We're from an area with little in the way of opportunities, and while I did well enough to get scholarships and attend college, Jake decided to join the military. We talked extensively about this, and he was vocal in his intention to only join for one term to get the GI Bill and then get out and go to college.

When I married him, Jake was a sweet, funny guy who enjoyed cooking and the only things he'd willingly hurt were deer. 

But after he joined, Jake changed. He got a lot angrier, in general. I'd never known him to have a temper, but he went from never raising his voice to yelling at his family and me when he didn't get his way, to less pleasant behavior when he was drunk. And oh how he drank. I have nothing against a beer with friends now and then, but after joining the military Jake was drinking constantly. His sense of humor got a lot cruder, too, ""Dirty little sheet heads!"" became his favorite punchline.

The final straw was when we discussed his plans to get out and go to college since he was looking at whether to stay in or get out. He wanted to stay in. I reminded him he'd promised to get out. He'd been drinking, and things got ugly.

The wives' club at the base was no help, so I started quietly looking into how to divorce Jake. Then, earlier this year, he died in a car accident. My only feeling was, honestly, relief. I went to his funeral and didn't say anything at the service, but at dinner Jake's little sister approached me and said she'd started dating a soldier and wanted to know if I had any advice. My advice? ""Don't. The military ruined Jake and turned the man I loved into a drunk, abusive asshole.""

Jake's family predictably erupted in a firestorm, but more alarmingly to me, my own parents have taken their side.

AITA for not telling someone I can read lips,24010,Not the A-hole,878,hidzc5,1593511222.0,"This happened pre COVID btw.

I've had hearing loss for most of my life , but it was diagnosed when I was about 7 years old. So I learned to read lips at the same time I was learning to speak. I'm very proficient in reading lips.

Whenever I work with someone new, I make sure to let them know that I have hearing loss and to make sure that they are facing me and I'm aware they're talkin to me.

I've never actually mentioned to any co-workers that I could read lips & but I'm pretty sure most of them at least suspect it strongly.

A new co-worker started and I did my customary introduction and disclaimer about my hearing. 

I don't think she believed me because she got very offended when I ignored her. The problem being she was trying to get my attention from behind me and I genuinely did not hear her. Once someone got my attention I apologize to her and pointed out that I did have hearing loss and I wasn't aware that she was talking to me.

A few days later she was venting to a mutual coworker. The only problem was she was facing me and I could read her lips perfectly. 

After a few minutes I approached her and let her know that if she was going to s*** talk someone she needed to make sure they couldn't understand her and that I was reading her lips the entire time.

I told her I was upset that she wouldn't just come to me, and that I did tell her twice that I was partially deaf and couldn't hear her. She freaked out because apparently I was being rude by reading her lips when she was facing me",False,False,2020-06-30 03:00:22
UPDATE to AITA for demanding the same Christmas present my stepbrother got?,23692,UPDATE,1255,elflwa,1578451094.0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ebjcyh/aita_for_demanding_the_same_christmas_present_my

Here's the update some of you have been asking for.

I decided I needed a break from my dad and his family so I spent the holidays exclusively at my mom's house. I will most likely not be continuing the week on/off arrangement at my dad's house this year.

The reason I initially got from my dad is that apparently I'm better at getting rides, while my step brother keeps bugging them for rides. And also because my stepbrother is there full time and I'm only there every other week.  I think that's totally bullshit. He knows how difficult it has been to get to my part time job. My stepbrother doesn't even have a job, like damn. And now the custody bs is my problem? I don't think so.

I took the gift card and told my dad not to bother with getting me a car. I'm currently ""borrowing"" my grandmom's 2002 Corolla and I love it. And all I have to do in exchange is drive my grandmom around whenever she wants. It's awesome. We have a blast going around town.

There were a lot of different judgements on my initial post but at least I know I'm not completely crazy.

People might think I'm being an entitled brat and that's fair. But I was legit so grateful for the gift card. I was freaking out. But I felt so stupid when I found out what my stepbrother got. It's not that I needed a car. I just wanted to be treated equally.

This is the first time ever I've been actually resentful about having my step brother in my life. Which I don't want to feel but it's the truth. They could've bought two cars for what they spent on my step brother's car. 

I don't hate my dad. But I realized that I can't really expect him to do right by me without me bitching about it. He's been sending money to my mother now since I'm here full-time. Some of that money is used to pay for my insurance. 

He does text me a few times a week and I reply but I don't really have long conversations with him. I know he's sorry and he wants me around. But I just need some space from him. It kinda sucks realizing that a parent might not love you as much as you thought they did. But I'm sure our relationship will improve in time.

I'm on track for college this year and I want to focus on school and put all this behind me. I'll be one of the few people from our family going to college so everyone is pretty excited.

So all in all, I think the outcome is pretty positive. 

Thanks guys.",False,False,2020-01-07 18:38:14
AITA for ruining jeans for women?,23687,Asshole,4333,d8lqlj,1569352783.0,"I work at an office where I’m allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the “no jeans policy.” She frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. 

Problem is, for the past few months that I’ve been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. Tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. That is, until a few days ago. 

I love wearing jeans, and have always felt I could make them professional too. I was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. She said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. 

I said “Well, the girls get to wear jeans.”

“No they don’t.”

Then, my coworker, Amanda walked in wearing jeans. I pointed that out. My manager confronted Amanda, telling her that she wasn’t allowed to wear jeans. 

In the moment, Amanda appeared playfully mad at me. But I went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but I think she may actually be mad. I apologized, saying I didn’t want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans. 

AITA?

EDIT/ UPDATE: Wow, did not expect all of the responses, though I can’t say I’m surprised about the polarization. At work today, it wasn’t bad. Only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. I do feel bad that I ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day I will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all.

AITA for refusing to give my parents money?,23791,Not the A-hole,2726,hfkctd,1593112786.0,"I’m a 19 year old F with six older siblings. My parents spent most of my childhood spending money they didn’t have on my siblings, so by the time I hit my teenage years, I realized I was probably going to have to fend for myself financially when I turn 18. I started babysitting and doing odd jobs around my neighborhood when I was 14, and eventually got part-time jobs during the school year. 


By the time I was 16, I was working three jobs in the summer and two in addition to school. When my parents told me they couldn’t pay for college, I’d already earned enough (along with scholarships) to be able to put myself through college and have plenty left over. I’ve continued to work during the school year, and have been able to make money during quarantine by tutoring online. 


The issue began a few months ago, when my eldest sister (29F) got married. My parents spent 30 grand on her wedding, taking out a second mortgage to do so. To make matters worse, my dad was furloughed 6 days after the wedding. They’d effectively dug themselves into a hole they couldn’t get out of. 


Two weeks ago, my mom texted me for the first time since the wedding. She didn’t say hi, ask how I was, or make any small talk. She just said “Your dad and I need a favor. When can we call you?” 


I’d expected this. None of my elder siblings are doing well financially, and they’ve exhausted all other loan options, both from family and the bank. I figured they would text me, ask me to loan them a few thousand, and promise to pay it back when they could figure things out. I was absolutely willing to pitch in a few thousand, and had even considered giving them some of my tutoring jobs so they could make some extra cash. 


I was not, however, expecting them to demand I GIVE them all the money (close to $40,000) I’d made from the ages of 14-18. 


The exact statement my mom had made was “You made that money under our roof. We were the ones who allowed you to work, so you only have it because of us anyway...We bought you food and clothes for 18 years. That money is only a fraction of what you owe us...” and so on.


I said that food, clothes, and shelter were the very minimum, it’s what they signed up for when they chose to become parents, I didn’t ask for any of it, etc. They responded by telling me that if it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t have the life I have today. I said they were being ridiculous, and hung up. 


Since that day, both (along with two of my siblings) have continuously hounded me about giving them what is “rightfully theirs.” My siblings, who have never been asked to give them money, are still professing that it’s my job as their kid to take care of them. I told them they wouldn’t see a cent of my hard-earned money, and have no right to make such a request.


I’m torn. I feel awful for refusing to help them out, but on the other hand, this was their fault. I feel I shouldn’t be responsible for fixing their mess. AITA?",False,False,2020-06-25 12:19:46
AITA fot kicking out my daughter after she tried to send my cat to the shelter?,23778,Not the A-hole,2913,hg83en,1593208787.0,"Throw away for obvious reasons. TLDR at the end.

&#x200B;

the relevant backstory: I have two daughters, one is 21 and in college, the other is 26 and because of a lot of factors finds herself pregnant, divorcing her husband and needing to live in our house for the foreseeable future and I am happily married to their mother.  The other notable character is my cat Lieutenant (we call her Leut). I found Leut in a dumpster almost ten years ago when she was only a week old, got her to the vet and she has been my best buddy for the last decade. She is now my grumpy old little shadow whenever i'm home.

&#x200B;

so yesterday I came home from work and I hear my eldest daughter calling me from the kitchen. my wife and eldest then tell me that ""Leut is getting old dad, and with the baby coming we didn't think it was safe to keep an old grouchy cat around an infant. So we made the decision today to send Leut to a shelter so that she can find a family that is more in line with what she needs.""

&#x200B;

I told them both they were WAY out of line (not in so many words) and we would talk when we get back. I drive to the closest shelter, fine Leut, prove ownership, pay the $100 fee to get her back, and take her home.

&#x200B;

So here is the drama part: When I get home I call a family meeting and tell my eldest she doesn't get to make decisions about my pets without consulting me, Leut only wants to be left alone and even if it came to it i would rather exhaust all my options before putting Leut through life at a shelter. My eldest began arguing with me that Leut would be a liability around an infant and she is unpredictable (untrue, she is either asleep, sitting on her cat tree or eating). At that point i saw red and told her my cat is well trained, and dared her to come up with one instance of Leut even scratching someone, which she couldn't but kept insisting that old cats are inherently dangerous for kids. I then told herthat she had one month to get a new place to live as she clearly doesn't respect me or my things, and that if Leut so much as lost a whisker, I would hold her personally responsible.

&#x200B;

My wife and younger daughter are now begging me to change my mind as with my eldest's current financial condition i would probably be condemning her to homelessness, and that my daughter should come before a cat.

AITA for kicking my daughter out after she tried to get rid of my cat?

TLDR: eldest daughter decided to send my elderly cat to a shelter over fears she would harm her baby when the child is born. I kicked her out. AITA?

Edit to add:

As many people have brought up, no i am not being as hard on my wife as my daughter. My wife came up to me last night and basically begged for forgiveness, saying she wasn't thinking and just accepted the things my daughter was saying without checking  (very out of character for her). So I have told her i will need some space for the foreseeable future but that she and I are ok.

&#x200B;

Leut is already microcipped and wears a collar and tag. I have also contacted all the shelters around my area and sent them Leut's picture chip ID and my contact information and an explanation that i am worried someone may surrender my cat without my permission.",True,1593189640.0,2020-06-26 14:59:47
AITA For telling a stranger to delete a picture of me and my seizure alert dog that he took of me on the bus even after he told me why?,23643,Not the A-hole,2978,e015on,1574459067.0,"Heya. 

So this happened a few days ago, and I'm still pretty worried about whether I'm an asshole or not. 

I take the bus to and from work and it's quite a long commute. Background: 

 I have epilepsy. I have a seizure alert dog, and he comes with me on the bus. Because hes trained to do all kinds of support tasks, hes a large breed dog (sheepdog/poodle cross). 

Ive had a lot of seizures on the bus, so I have a hard time mentally dealing with the commute every day. To accommodate his size and to make me comfortable, I sit in the disability seating section if it's available so he can lay beneath/between my legs and out of the way. 

Now onto the story: 

I'm on the bus ride home, and I found a seat in the disability section. I was about 2 stops from my home, and  I was starting to have a few auras, so my dog turned around and was facing me/alerting me. The next thing I know, I see a flash. 

I look up, and a man sitting near me was holding up his phone and taking a picture of me. I was in a bit of a rough state, so I asked him to delete it. I was probably firmer than I usually would be, but my dog was alerting me and I had about 10-15 mins to get home. 

The man was stuttering and saying things like ""I just wanted a picture he was being so cute and I saw his ID badge (he has one attached to his vest that says ""seizure alert dog"")."" I asked him again to delete the pic and then he goes ""my daughter has epilepsy and it would be important to her to see a working seizure alert dog"" 

I told him there were plenty of resources online and made him show me that he deleted it. 

I was then at my stop and ran home.

I felt bad, because I do epilepsy activism work so I felt for him but I was really uncomfortable with someone taking a picture of me while my seizure alert dog in the disability section just felt wrong. 

Should I have just let him keep the picture? AITA?

Edit to clear up some things: 

-I dont care about legality, just the asshole nature of the situation
-I'm a female :) 
-I live in Canada
-While I dont have exclusive photosensitive epilepsy, flashing lights make my auras worse 
-If he had asked me, I would have gotten out of the way and let him take a picture of my dog. Hes super cute so I get it.

We’re all in our early 20s. My girlfriend hangs out with Amy quite often. I see her from time to time, but I’ve never cared for her cheeky attitude. The tipping point was tonight. 


Dinner was going alright until Amy’s boyfriend innocently commented on how little my girlfriend ate. She usually gives me half her entrée. After that, Amy, who isn’t stick thin like my girlfriend, snidely remarked that my girlfriend wouldn’t need fake boobs if she ate like a real woman. 


I loudly told her to watch her fat goddamn mouth and that her comment was both rude and unnecessary. Amy isn’t overweight by most standards, but that adjective slipped out because of what she said prior. Many people turned their eyes toward us. 


My girlfriend and Amy’s boyfriend tried to quell the ruckus, but Amy got up and told me to have fun with my Barbie doll before she motioned Amy’s boyfriend to get up and leave with her. Don’t worry, you pay before you get your food at this restaurant.

AITA for not wanting my parents to adopt another teenage girl,23597,Not the A-hole,2375,gf4knq,1588878679.0,"I (15F) live with my parents (mid-40s) and my brother (9M). It’s always been a dream of my parents to adopt (me and bro are bio-kids) and they had come to the decision that they want to adopt an older kid. They got matched with ‘Jess’ who is 13. Due to the current situation, she is not living with us, but we’ve met before and she’s spent a weekend with us in January. Jess, despite sometimes being sweet and kind, is very high maintenance and has a lot of anxiety and anger problems. She can go from 0-1000 really quick. During her stay, she got triggered by something when we were in public (she and I went to a clothes shop and my parents were in a cafe nearby - some guy accidentally grabbed her by her shoulder as he thought she was his daughter, and he apologised immediately) and started screaming. I was the only person there, and I tried to calm her down but she ran off.

She was found (shaken, but safe) an hour later. I then got grounded as I had failed in being responsible for my ‘sister.’ I said I didn’t have a sister. My parents were angry about this and said that how dare I be rude about her, don’t I know how much she’s been through. She’s had other outbursts, but none so huge in public. She can be cold and untrusting and was very clingy to my parents. I do admire her, and think she’s very brave - but I don’t want to live with her.

My parents call Jess often. I often say hi, and try to be civil and supportive. But it seems like the only thing my parents can talk about is Jess, and how brave she is, and she isn’t even here yet.

We live in a 3 bedroom house, and my parents promised to move to a bigger one later this year. Recently, my parents broke the news to me that Jess will move into my room, and I can pick whether I want to share a room with bro, or Jess. I don’t want to share with either. My brother is messy, loud and is your average 9yo boy and Jess has night terrors and screams the house down, and it’s enough having to open my house to her, but I value my privacy a lot and don’t want her in my room, which is like my special place. I was crushed. I asked if we were still moving, and my parents were like, ‘We like this place and have no solid plan.’ I freaked out and was like, ‘You guys are forgetting you have another daughter and are too excited about the shiny new one to remember that the one you have has feelings and boundaries, and if you’re changing everything I’ve ever known, at least I deserve to be listened to. If this is how life’s going to be, I don’t want to have a sister.’

Good to note: my room is big enough to have a wall put in, and my parents considered it a few years back. I would be happy with that. They refuse, even though we can easily afford it, because it is ‘too much effort.’

My parents are offended that I’m ‘not being welcoming’ towards my ‘sister’, and I’m offended that the life I knew is going to be turned upside down, and I’m not going to have the thing I value most, my privacy. AITA?

Update: this blew up... enough to reach jess. she called me and we had a good heart to heart. she was unaware of the situation, and felt really uncomfortable about it. we had a family meeting via skype to explain to my parents why this was a bad idea, and showed them some of the comments in this thread. they apologised and they said they would try to improve their behaviour. we asked to put up a wall, and they agreed. my father is currently watching a video on how to do it lol.

We live in England, so this is an issue for like, half of the year. She refuses to touch anything that might be cold, including the floor with her feet in winter, door handles, walls, cold water, absolutely anything. She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice), meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes in.

It's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing. It's getting ridiculous to see her refusing to do literally anything because she might have to touch something cold. On Thursday, she left her slipper boots on the other side of the bedroom (she had socks on, but took them off when she got in bed) so she called in sick to work and stayed in bed all day.

Cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. Then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

She couldn’t help her alone, as the woman was quite big. So another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

The barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if I could help and I said “ I was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, I’m good”.

I kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

They all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

Am I the asshole for refusing to help her after she was extremely rude and refused my help at first?

AITA For Telling My Wife That If She Quits Her Job I Expect Her To Cover All The Housework?,23464,Not the A-hole,3837,cyj5v1,1567420490.0,"My wife wants to quit her job. She wants to be a SAHM to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.


In order for her to do that, I would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on Saturdays. I told her that I if she quits her job then I expect her to cover all the housework. I may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. I will will help out on weekends but during weekdays I rather rest. 


My wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and I am being lazy and discriminative against women. I don't really mean that, as I think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. I will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. AITA?


Edit: I admit that I did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because I was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. Our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. Ofcourse, I also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them.",True,1567410150.0,2019-09-02 03:34:50
AITA for correcting every single sentence spoken by my boyfriend’s aunt in front of everyone?,23360,Not the A-hole,2004,dv4je8,1573559945.0,"I know the title looks pretty bad but hear me out! 
I’m a native French speaker from Canada, but I have a very pronounced “Acadian/Chiac” accent. For those who don’t know, it’s pretty much a mix of French and English with some local dialect thrown in there. Pretty common in the maritimes, where I still live. I’m perfectly bilingual in both languages.

I started dating my boyfriend, who only speaks English, about 4 years ago and spend a lot of time with his family, they’ve all been really great, except for one of his aunts. She says she was a French teacher in anglophone schools for over 40 years up until a year ago and even studied in France, and she INSISTS on only talking to me in French. I agreed at first since I didn’t want to be rude to his family but it’s getting super weird. I don’t understand how she was able to teach kids English or how she comes up with most of her sentence, like I have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope I’m right because it makes absolutely no sense. (Example: she said “a la citrouille la tarte va bien dans ma bouche” which roughly translates to “to the pumpkin a pie goes well in my mouth” when she meant “this pumpkin pie tastes delicious”) 
She constantly criticizes my “accent”.  and tries to correct my pronunciation of certain words, and tells me I need to “pick a language” when I accidentally say something in chiac (speaking proper “français standard” is actually getting harder for me since I’ve been only studying/working in English). 

So last night during dinner she started going on about how Acadians were uneducated and made no effort to properly learn a language, which is total BS, and obviously weirdly directed at me. For the rest of the night I stopped guessing what she was trying to say to me in french, acting like I didn’t understand anything, and started correcting her as well - which was pretty much every single sentence she said. I wasn’t trying to be rude or aggressive about it but after a while she gave up on the French and ignored me for the rest of the night.  
Turns out she was super pissed and told everyone I was trying to embarrass her in front of everyone. Looking back I think I might’ve taken it too far by not stopping after 2-3 sentences and I feel bad. My boyfriend said I was being bitchy while his mom said she probably deserved it. AITA here?


EDIT: Forgot to mention that I told her a few years ago that it’s hard for me to fully speak proper French as I spoke chiac all my life, tried to explain Acadian culture (she wasn’t having it, surprise) and she stopped for a while but is now doing it again.",False,1573532199.0,2019-11-12 03:59:05
AITA for telling my brother in law that paternity tests aren't automatic,23336,Not the A-hole,1889,gdr20t,1588681428.0,"UPDATE: wow this got a lot of comments!!!

So I have done a LOT of snooping. And it is way more soap opera than I thought.

1) apparently since child 1 didn't look like him at all, she made up the paternity test scheme to trick him into marrying her. But, THEY ACTUALLY DID PATERNITY TEST THAT KID and the real test said her ex was the dad. But he refused so she lied about the result, and my bfs bro never asked to see the papers

2) it gets worse. She's been secretly collecting child support from bio dad, and using it as get secret slush fund, while being a stay at home mom and making husband pay her way

3) she cheated on him A LOT and figured that she could lie again if the kids weren't his, and secretly rake in the child support. So, each baby she had tested, but the next two were his.

4) he decided to stay bc the kids - but he called the baby daddy of Kid 1 and explained the whole situation.

5) Baby Daddy of kid 1 is in negotiations for visitation or to cease child support.


ORIGINAL POST

A while back I started buying a house w my boyfriend. We decided to let his brother and his brother's wife and kids live with us.

The wife and I each got pregnant within a few months of each other, and so the house was totally wrapped up in baby preparations.

Well, when it's her turn to give birth, he gets back with her and he's all aglow and happy saying how much the new baby looks like him, and he says ""I couldn't deny her [the baby] if I tried even without the paternity test!""

I thought this was a weird thing to say. As far as I knew, their relationship was good, so I didn't see why they would do a test.

The first time he said it I let it go, but he said it a few times to a few family friends and it really started to bother me. Especially that everyone just took it in stride.

Finally, when everyone was gone various places, I asked what he meant by that. I was like ""you keep talking about a paternity test what's that about"" and he said it was ""the one they do when a baby gets born, at the hospital"" and I asked what he meant and he got frustrated and said ""you know the one they always do at the hospital when a baby gets born, like you guys when yours was born, so they can put it on the birth certificate.""

The confused me even more. I explained to him we didn't have one done, that we filled out the birth certificate paperwork beforehand, and all they did was ask my bf if he was the dad and he said yeah so they marked it down.

He got really quiet, and it kinda clicked for me that something was up, so I said ""maybe it's because I have different insurance"" because that's all I could think of.

Well he shut himself in his room, and when his wife got back they had a huge fight, and it turns out she's been cheating on him for like six years. 

Everyone is upset with me for telling him, because it ruined their happiness about their new baby. Am I the asshole?",False,1588873713.0,2020-05-05 05:23:48
AITA for buying my wife a Roomba for Christmas?,23332,Asshole,9134,ed9cyv,1576872539.0,"This happened last year but since it still gets brought up during arguments every now and then and I just discovered this Subreddit I decided to check what you guys think.

Me and my wife have two children (15F & 11M). My wife is a stay at home mom since the birth of our second child. I (46M) work full time and earn a six figure salary. My job is highly stressful, requires me to travel a lot and mostly sleep in hotels. I only get to come home to my family on every second weekend, on average. Despite working a lot, I am glad to do it so that my family can live a comfortable life.

Last year, I decided to buy my wife a Roomba for Christmas. My wife tends to be the one who vacuums the house so I presumed that she would like this present as it would free her of this chore.

As she unpacked the present, she was heavily offended and did not hesitate to show it, which made the whole situation quite uncomfortable as my parents and other members of the family were also present. She argued that 'this should not be a present directed at her but at the whole family, as it is the entire family’s responsibility to clean up the house'.

Since I work and am the sole source of income in the family and she is a stay at home mother, I think it is apparent that she should take on responsibilities such as taking care of the kids and maintaining the house. The gift was intended to somewhat relieve her of this burden. I, personally, would have loved to have received a Christmas gift that would have somehow made it possible for me to spend less time working. As cheesy as it sounds, I think that time is one of the most precious gifts and that Roomba would have definitely bought some time for her - time that she could use to do whatever she pleased instead of vacuuming. 

Unfortunately, one year later, this still often gets brought up during arguments, often coupled with her crying.

So, AITA in this situation?

EDIT: I should also add that I would have never gifted my wife a vacuum cleaner or anything along these lines. I saw the Roomba as a robot that would fully take over this task which is why I thought it was a good idea.

EDIT #2: I asked her numerous times before Christmas last year what she would have liked to receive and she repeatedly told me that she does not want anything. I was left to guess and chose the most practical gift that I was certain she could be able to make use of.",False,1576856260.0,2019-12-20 12:08:59
AITA for emasculating my BF?,23329,Not the A-hole,2226,glilwo,1589762606.0,"I (30F) met this guy (28M) in January and he became my BF in February. Comes March, the world goes down the drain and we decided to move in together for the time of the pandemic. Everything is great.


In the morning, we have this routine where he browses Reddit and gives me the highlights. A few weeks ago, he shows me a post where this guy is challenged to an arm wrestling competition by his GF. The guy didn't seem to have any sort of training/work out whereas his GF did.


I commented he might have a surprise. My BF started educating me on biology and how men are stronger than women. I told him there were way too many factors to take into consideration to make such a broad comment. I have been doing weightlifting for 2 years and my BF has never seen a gym in his life, so I used us as an example. That was a BIG mistake.


He got really defensive and condescending, and made comments like ""That's cute."" I just let it go.


Fast forward to yesterday. He's playing some game with his friend (online) and I can clearly hear him talk about me. Well curiosity killed the cat. 


At first it's all pretty and my ego is bursting, but then he says I'm delusional because I think I'm stronger than him. Pause. ""Seriously? I know I'm weak but not weaker than a girl."" So later, I decide to call him on his BS. I asked him if he wanted to come workout with me the next day (this morning) so he can show me how strong he is. He accepted and I was happy because I had been dying to bring him and initiate him to something I'm passionate about. 


So, this morning, we went to my friend's (27M) garage (my region allows groups of 10 or less and we wipe everything). I told him we're gonna do deadlifts. It's my favorite exercise and I was already planning to test my personal best so it was perfect.


My friend was there cause he corrects my form and it's been our Sunday ritual since Covid-19. We started light and slowly worked our way up, doing the same number of reps as the other. Comes 185, his form starts to crumble so we made him go lighter. But 185 really isn't that much for me so I kept stacking the plates. He looked very supportive and impressed the whole time. I ended up beating my personal best at 265. I was ecstatic and so were they.


When we got in the car, he was very silent. I assumed he was just tired. We got home and that's when he exploded and asked me if I was proud of myself. Apparently, I humiliated him in front of my friend. I apologized. I didnt realize he was feeling that way. He got angry and said it really changed the way he saw me, like I'm less of a woman now. He stormed to the basement. 


I started collecting my things, but now I'm wondering if I should have been reading between the lines and stopped at 190 or something. Or just dropped it and never suggested we workout together? I knew very well I was stronger than him but I just had to prove it to him. AITA?


Update: I still didnt get a word of him but since some of you asked, I will make sure to update you when he does. Thank you for the overwhelming response. That was a bit of a rollercoaster day but it made it easier to know I'm not completely in the wrong.",True,1589773858.0,2020-05-17 17:43:26
AITA for only going out to eat with my uncle after the rest of my family disagreed with my restaurant choice?,23315,Not the A-hole,1283,gyip6p,1591587080.0,"I (F21) am currently living with my uncle and his family while I attend university. In my family it's tradition for everyone to invite out their family for their birthday. The person celebrating their birthday pays.

My birthday was yesterday and luckily restaurants here have already opened up. About a week in advance I chose a Moroccan couscous restaurant and made a reservation. I briefly mentioned it to the rest of the family at dinner but I don't think most of them were listening.

Two days ago I reminded everybody where we were going. Everybody except for my uncle started to complain about the choice. My extremely picky cousin (17) apparently hates Moroccan food, even though I don't think he's ever tried it. My aunt is uncomfortable with going to ""that kind"" of restaurant (?). My other cousin (26) is a vegan and didn't think he would be able to eat a lot of things, and his girlfriend didn't want to eat there because she's on a raw food diet. My other cousin is apparently on a diet  and didn't want to go somewhere where she could get a salad.

It didn't really bother me that they disagreed with my choice, but what bothered me was that they hadn't even tried the food or looked at the menu, but already didn't want to go. They asked me to change my choice and instead that we could go to a nearby restaurant that they go to every week and that I don't really like. I refused and said they just didn't have to come.

Only my uncle came with me when we went to the restaurant yesterday, which I'm happy about because I know the rest of the family would have done nothing but complain. It was delicious and it was nice eating with an actually adventurous person for once. 

Now the rest of the family is angry at us because birthday meals usually include the whole family, and they think it's inconsiderate of us to have eaten without them. I think it's their fault for not even wanting to try it. AITA?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your judgements. I saw a lot of people confused about paying when it's your birthday. Where I'm from it's the custom, not just in my family but everywhere. I think it's a nice custom. That way no guest worries about not being able to pay, and it's nice to be able to pay for family and friends to have a nice meal.",False,1591573767.0,2020-06-07 20:31:20
WIBTA if I report the nurse practitioner at urgent care to HR for basically slut shaming me?,23298,Not the A-hole,1240,cemg2f,1563445117.0,"I've \[F21\] recently encountered a new sexual partner. We used a condom, but after words I felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time I have ever hooked up with someone I just met. My previous sexual partners have all been someone I have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. While condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a STI, it cannot provide ABSOLUTE protection. A few days ago, I noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an STD. I have never had one before and I have no idea the symptoms, but an STD was all I could think about. 


I went to an urgent care because I wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or UTI) and if not, I wanted to send my urine off for an STD screening.  My doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which I was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. 


It came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. She says based on my symptoms, I am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and STD screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. 


As I'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says ""Dear, will you sit down for just another moment."" I sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. ""With all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,"". I looked at her like ""what the fuck"" and she continued ""well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,"". At this point, I was pretty fucking angry. You could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. I thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say ""you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,"".

I was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn I get slut shamed for it? I posted this in a forum about sexual education and I was getting advice to report her to HR. I don’t want to go after anybody’s job, but I don’t want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. 

Will I be the asshole if I report her to HR or should I leave it alone?

Edit: For everybody asking, I was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. I just kind of stared at her because I immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information I shared with her so openly. So after a couple of seconds she said “I appreciate your openness and honesty tho” (like that mattered after anything she just said 😩) and opened the door for me to leave so I just said “thanks” and left. I was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. Trust me, I wish I would have but I wasn’t even thinking about going off on her. I was just embarrassed. 

Also, she was a nurse practitioner. I know a couple of times I referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was NP. 

And for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that I’m having more fun than u 😘


UPDATE

Before I start off with the update, I want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. 

1) I am not heartless, and in the original post I even directly said I did not want to go for her job. That was never my intention and I even explicitly said that. 

2) for ever man calling me a slut: you’re obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. I also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody I just met, so “closing my legs” or “quit being easy” doesn’t fucking apply. In Game if Thrones, every single “whore” had one thing in common and that’s that they enjoyed sex. So if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! 

3) For teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. What you decide to do with your body is really nobody’s business despite what other people are saying on this thread. 

Now to the update: 
I called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or NP supervisor. They didn’t have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the NPs was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. 

First and foremost, I explained to the manager that I in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. I did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or PIP to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. 

I explained to her everything that happened and before I could even say who the NP was, she knew EXACTLY who I was talking about...which confirmed that she’s most likely been this way towards other patients previously. 

I then explained how I confided in her and that I came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. I explained that her words didn’t hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers AND future interactions with her other women patients. 

The lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she’d “call the doctor (her supervisor)” right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. She also said she was placing a note and that the NP wouldn’t be back in the office until next Monday. 

With all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! You’ve truly been so helpful. 

And for the people calling me a slut for this, I hope to God this same thing doesn’t happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.",True,1563475624.0,2019-07-18 03:18:37

# The Rescue Dog of the Moment

If you miss the cute segment on morning news when they bring out a group of local shelter pets, to get them a publicity bump, but you never get to see that because *who the hell is watching local morning news anymore,* then this post is for YOU!

# [This is Hazel](https://imgur.com/gallery/tAqmmCX)!

Hazel is a 4 year old Rottweiler/Boxer(?)/Pittie(?) who's been living in her foster home for 2 years waiting for her furever home.  She's healthy and happy.  She is a sweet, gentle lady who loves to kiss faces and is prone to occasional bursts of silliness.

She's available to adopters in and around New England.  If you'd like to consider giving Hazel the home she richly deserves, her adoption profile is here: [https://bigfluffydogs.com/our-dogs/hazel-3/](https://bigfluffydogs.com/our-dogs/hazel-3/) (And if you DO eventually adopt her, be sure to come back here to brag so you can be sub hero for a week!)

If you aren't in the Northeast, but have the kindness to adopt a dog in need, try searching for a rescue organization on [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/animal-shelters-and-rescues/search/). I promise that there are many great dogs and probably many great rescue orgs in your area!

**Some ground rules:**

The way it works is we're going to sticky this post until Hazel gets a home with a ""furever"" family.  We're not going to show you a dog and say he's on death row.  We're not going to shock or depress you with a canine trainwreck and ask for donations for vet bills.  We'll just keep one happy pup's picture up, while she's safe in a loving foster home, and hope that you'll share her pics and check out her rescue site until somone takes this lovable little fuzzface home.  If a subscriber does adopt her, we'll even keep her  sticky post up for a while after adoption, giving the adopter plenty of time to brag about their new furkid and post happy pictures of their new best goodgirl at home.  **Let's see if 1.5 million potential assholes can bring a family together before the year's over!**

If you don't want to see rescue dogs, all you have to do is ignore one sticky post, quit yer whining, and enjoy the sub as usual.

Full disclosure, I'm a board member of Hazel's rescue.  No money is changing hands and no considerations are being offered or transferred between us.  I just want to make room for one more deserving dog to get out of the shelter system and get as many of you thinking about fostering, rescuing, and adopting-not-shopping as possible.

P.S. If you happen to be Chrissy Teigen, please tweet about this!

*Edit:  It seems there is a substantial group of people with hatred for dogs or specific breeds out there on reddit, and they have come to this discussion to try to spoil a good thing with baseless accusations fueled by paranoia. Whenever any dog has shown the slightest interest in chasing cats (or in Hazel's case, because she has chased squirrels and rabbits in her foster's yard), the rescue puts the exaggerated statement ""They think that cats are tasty treats"" into the Petfinder description so that no one with a cat becomes interested, and we never have to risk an adopter irresponsibly mixing that dog with their cat. Hazel has NO history of aggression against people or cats.  --Anyone saying she was abandoned because of either of these things is making up stories.--*  

*Out of abundant concern, the rescue will not place her with any households that will mix her with cats. As for small children...there is no history of aggression toward people of any age. It's my feeling that a healthy and friendly 65lb dog who occasionally runs around with excitement can knock little kids down and bump them by accident. (Ever have a dog headbutt you because you were leaning over them when they decided to jump up? That kind of thing.) The rescue will explain her energy level in detail to any family with small children who applies and let them decide if they think their child is old/large/mature enough to handle this. In some cases, the rescue will make that evaluation and not approve the application. This is a very thoughtful, careful process that is carried out in private between the individual who applies and the co-ordinator who knows the dog much better than I (or anyone in a comment stream making gross assumptions) does.*",False,1574865384.0,2019-11-27 00:14:46
AITA for refusing to share my extra income with my wife when she didn't share hers with me when she earned more?,23214,Everyone Sucks,163,d0ariq,1567766646.0,"When my wife \[32F\] and I \[32M\] got married eighht years ago, she made about 15K more per year than I did. Our agreement at that time was that we'd keep separate checking accounts plus a joint for household expenses, with the understanding that money left over after contributions to household expenses, savings, retirement, etc. would be put in the separate accounts and we could spend it how we wanted. My wife was the one who insisted on this, and although I was not a fan (wanted joint accounts for all funds), I agreed since she felt strongly about it.

A few years after we married I decided to go to law school. Long story short, I ended up at a big law firm and now earn about four times what my wife does. Since I managed not to go into debt, I have a good bit of money left over after I make my contributions to our joint expenses.

&#x200B;

My wife  asked me to reconsider this arrangement (she doesn't feel like its fair that I get to buy most of the things I want while she is on a much more limited budget), and I told her I would not reconsider it since this is what she wanted originally. I think fair is fair since this was her idea, but I do wonder if  I am wrong for refusing to reconsider our financial arrangement?

AITA for lying to my boyfriend about when an event starts?,23131,Not the A-hole,4595,cxf4fa,1567190187.0,"So this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so I figured I would bring it to the group to see if I'm the asshole or not.

My boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  I absolutely hate it because I am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.

For an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  Everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  We live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  We were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.

A few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  Knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, I told my boyfriend that the event started at Noon, not 1:00.  And just as I figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  We show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.

So last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  I had lied about what time the event started.  I know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if I can lie about something like that, whose to say what else I'd be lying about.  I told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that I don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if I'm 'hiding something'.  I explained that I only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  In my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.

He doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one I lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).

I've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but I just have to know if I'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.

"AITA For ""Ruining"" my kid's life after she ruined a dress?",23238,Not the A-hole,4309,hfhlrg,1593097562.0,"Ex(31) and I(m32) had C, (F16) way too young. We're friendly co-parents. One big rule we share is if our daughter breaks something, she pays for it.

Now, sis (27) and I are the only grandkids. Aunt never married. Instead, she worked with Gma and Gpa at their seamstry store, and took it over when they retired.

Sis's girlfriend (29) proposed last year. Gpa offered to make FSIL a custom suit, which she was over the moon about. Gma had me ask Sis what her dream dress was and record the convo. Sis, thinking it was just between us, told me in great detail what her dream dress was, though said it was way too expensive, so she would get something much cheaper. 

Well, a few months later Gma surprised Sis with her dream wedding dress. It fot perfectly and everyone cried. 

Sadly, Gma recently passed away, which hit us all hard. Sis was devistated, but decided that the dress meant Gma would still be there with us at the wedding. 

The issue comes in with C. She's very large, much larger then Sis. Three days ago, we decided to go visit Sis and see how she was doing. It was great, but then C asked if she could try on the dress. Sis politely said no. C made a face, but dropped it. 

Later, we decided to go grab dinner. Sis and I went to pick up our orders, but C decided to stay and play with Sis's dog.

We got back, and the dress was destroyed. C had apparently tried to get it on, popping some seams, and got stuck. Instead of waiting for help, she cut her way out. The dress was hacked to bits.

Sis was devistated and asked us to leave. I grounded C, and called Aunt with some pictures, asking if it could be saved. She said there was no. She said she'd make a new one, but it wasnt the same. Then she dropped the bomb on me - Gma had hand sewed most of the dress, used super expensive fabric, and put almost 500 hours in making that dress, since it was the only family wedding we'd have. In total, the dress cost 12,000 dollars, give or take. 

C has about 15,000 saved from various jobs, as well as winning writing competitions. This was supposed to help her in college. 

I took her to the bank and set in motion transferring all the funds, since as her parent I still have control over it. $12k to Aunt to pay for the new dress. $3k to my sister's wedding, as an emotional distress tax. 

I explained exactly why this was happening to C, but she sobbed the entire time, asking what was she supposed to do for college and saying it wasnt her fault. I told her she could get a job if she didnt get a scholarship, and it was her fault for trying on the dress after she'd been told no, and for not waiting until we got back. A few popped seams could have been fixed. Hacking the dress to pieces couldnt. 

C told my ex, and while she agreed C was in the wrong after the full story, said I shouldnt have ""ruined her future"" for a ""free"" dress. I reminded her of our rule, and she still thinks I'm wrong. 

So, am I the asshole here?

Edit - since people are mentioning they dont understand the 3k, that was to make up to my sister that C destroyed the last gift our dead grandma ever gave her. I consider that part of the price of destroying the dress, since even if Aunt remakes it, its lost a great deal of its sentinent value. 

I pointed out how young we has her because I wanted to explain how a 31 year old has a 16 year old kid. I do not resent having her, she's the best thing Ive ever done. I also brought up C's size because Sis has crohn's disease, and thus is very tiny. The dress was made her for size, and C is much larger then Sis. I love C as she is, but just holding the dress up, it was clear it wouldnt fit. 

The character count is very limiting.

Edit 2 - to clarify, the money was C's ""have fun at college"" money, not her college fund. My ex and I are paying for whatever scholarships dont. When she was asking what she would do for college, she was askong what'd she do for fun and to buy things we didnt pay for. Again, the character count is very limiting, so i had to cut details to post.

Edit 3 - So, I got off the phone with my ex about 20 minutes ago. At some of your suggestions, I sent her the pictures, and she freaked. She apparently didnt believe me when I said it had be hacked apart, and believed it was just a few torn seams. She was pretty much on my side after. She told me that she's spent the day badgering our daughter, asking her why she did what she did, and finally C cracked and said she was mad that Grandma wasnt alive to make her a dress, and that it was ""unfair"" my sister got a free beautiful dress as a reminder when my daughter got ""nothing,"" despite the many things she was given after the funeral. She tried it on, took it off when the seams popped, and then in anger hacked it apart. If she couldnt have a dress from Grandma, no one could. Her own words. 

Honestly, knowing she did it on purpose has just made things worse. The fact that she could be so cruel, thats not the daughter we tried to raise. She will be going to therapy, whether that's in person when local therapists start taking new clients again or on one of those apps people have mentioned. We need to talk about it more. Her punishment stands as is, though we're going to see how therapy goes. 

As for all the seamsters who have reached out, please know I'm touched by your kindness. I really am. My aunt is going to see if she can incorporate at least some of the fabric from the old dress into the new one, maybe at least try to save the beading, but if there's anything usable I'll reach out. I so so appreciate all of your offers, youre incredibly kind people. 

I have yet to talk to my sister, but I have talked to her fiance. Sis isnt doing well. The stress has caused a crohns flare up, so she's stuck in bed sick. Which, honestly, I'm not surprised. Crohns is often triggered by stressful events, so I was expecting it. I told fiance about Aunt making a new dress, and she promised to take the remains over to Aunt on Monday. She's thankful for us addressing the issue, but has asked for some space from Sis so she can recover and heal, and hopefully not end up in the hospital. 

As for the 3k, we'll see what my sister's state is in a few days. If she has to go to the hospital, then the money is forfit for her medical bills, since it was C's selfishness that put her there, so she can pay for it. If Sis does not end up in the hospital, then I'll consider giving it back after she's gone to therapy for a few months, if she's accepted what she did was wrong and worked to make ammends. 

We'll see what the next few monthd bring.",True,1593116653.0,2020-06-25 08:06:02
AITA for charging my sister £2500 for one of my paintings after her kid ruined it?,23102,Not the A-hole,3511,eqxekx,1579475599.0,"Backstory, I’m 26 and a fairly successful artist. My sister, “Lucy” (24) and her child “Ethan” (9) were at my house during a late New Years celebration. I had a sign posted on my art studio saying “DO NOT ENTER” and specifically made it clear to all guests that nobody was to enter that room. 
I’d also like to note that all my guests were asked to leave their kids at home as this was for ADULTS but ‘Lucy’ couldn’t do that because she couldn’t find a sitter. Anyway. 

Note : I also set up my boyfriends PS4 for him to play on so he wouldn’t be bored. 

It’s 10pm, and I hear a loud crash from my studio, I run up and see paint all over my recently work that so far had taken 15 hours to do. Ethan was sat there laughing, rubbing paint into my work, it’s now unsalvageable and I have to restart the work, as it was a specific request from a client. Which also puts me behind for the rest of my work now!! 

I immediately asked Ethan and Lucy to leave, and the next day I sent her a bill for the work. £2500 (which is LOWER than I would’ve gotten for the work anyway). 

She’s absolutely screaming about it, the whole family is divided. My mom hates me, my dad completely agrees with me. Surprise, my dad is an artist, my mum is more ‘smart smart’.  My sisters husband agrees with me.

AITA for intentionally posting the wrong test answers on a cheating website?,23066,Not the A-hole,3134,dyi6m8,1574184547.0,"BACKSTORY:

I failed my first 400-level  physical chemistry test 2 months ago. I barely passed my second one last month.I noticed I scored significantly below class average on both and the curve wasn’t quite what I expected it to be. (That’s ok, labs + hw keep my grade at a high B)

Side Note: The class is about 60 people. Unbeknownst to me, It fills up quickly every semester because people think the professor is ‘easy’. I didn’t know this. The class just fit my schedule and I certainly didn’t think it was ‘easy’ after those 2 exams.

Here’s the catch: Our professor is old and I noticed during exams that many people were suspiciously using their phones. I heard rumors that someone had posted the test questions to a relatively well-known site (it will remain unnamed)  and some students had used that to score A’s and B’s. (We can’t really use the site for homework help because of our homework structure, but a lot of us use it for test review & test prep, which is extremely helpful). Our tests are LONG -we get 2 and a half hours for each test- which gives these students plenty of time to post the questions and receive the answers online. 

EXAM DAY:

I was EXTREMELY irritated when I heard this. This rage really fueled me and I over-prepared for Test 3. I studied like crazy  for it because I felt like these cheating students were robbing me of points from a regular curve. I was able to finish the test in about 45 mins of the given time. I didn’t know everything, but I felt pretty great about what I turned in.  I was the second student done with the exam and felt pretty good as I wrapped it up. 

Once I finished and began walking out, I looked around and saw a ton of people cheating. I was so angry and so distraught, that I used my free time after the test to go on the site and see if my peers had posted the test questions. Of course they had. I had memorized all of the questions (there was only 6) and found 4 of the questions had been posted online.  I answered ALL of them incorrectly, though I made the process look somewhat legitimate. I realized that if I answered those questions first, the real site tutors wouldn’t answer them in the given time (I was right). 

PRESENT DAY:

I scored a high B, and the curve put my grade at an A. 

I had the fourth-highest score on the exam.

Most students failed, even though I found this test to be much easier and much more manageable than the previous two. I looked at the tests of my peers as we compared results. We always compare the partial-credit points to make sure our grades are fair. I saw that a LOT of them (I’d estimate about 13-15 students based on what I saw ) used the ”fake” methods I had used on those incorrect answers.  More students failed this test than the second test, and it was pretty evident that I’d screwed some of the cheating students. 

I honestly can’t say I feel bad about what I did. I worked hard, and their lazy efforts directly impacted my GPA and my future. 

EDIT: 
A common argument I see here is “See you studied and did better! Just keep doing that!” 
I studied like a maniac. I didn’t go out, didn’t attend meetings, just had total focus on this one test. It’s a completely unsustainable level of study and was only possible because I didn’t have much going on in my other classes.",False,1574185023.0,2019-11-19 09:29:07

 As petty revenge, I’m considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they’re loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am.

AITA for not inviting family members to my wedding?,22942,Not the A-hole,1474,g2zj2r,1587148604.0,"This goes back 3 years when my mom and her girlfriend got engaged. My mom put in so much time and energy into organizing this wedding and was so excited. She sent out invites to all our family members 4 months in advance, & almost everyone confirmed they would be going. 

Barely a week before the wedding, she received several messages from aunts and uncles who said they wont be going because they had “other commitments” despite confirming they’d be there months prior. 
One of my aunts (my grandma’s sister) confronted my mom and said many weren’t going because they still didn’t agree with the fact that she was marrying a woman, including herself because it went against her “Christian views”, meanwhile my hardcore Christian grandma was more than happy to walk my mom down the isle. 

This upset my mom but she tried not to let it ruin her wedding. I however, was furious. Only my grandma, my mom’s sister, a few cousins, and another aunt attended the wedding; while my stepmom’s entire family came.

 What really pissed me off was that 2 wks later, my cousin who lives in a totally different state celebrated her sweet 16 and everyone who made excuses about not going to my moms wedding made the journey all the way over there and posted pictures all over Facebook. It really broke my mom’s heart and just felt like salt in the wound. I swore then that when I got married, everyone who did not show up to my mom’s wedding would not be invited to mine. 

Fast forward to now , me and my girlfriend of two years got married first week of March and I kept my word. The only ones we invited to our wedding was the family that did go to my mom’s, and one other aunt who did have a good reason for not being there at the time because she was recovering from surgery. 

We even invited my stepmom’s family too. 

Obviously my other family members found out and expressed their hurt over not being invited. I called them all out and said if they had a problem with my mom for being who she is, then they had a problem with me and I wouldn’t let toxic people be apart of a special day for me and my wife.
 My wife stood behind my decision, as did my mom.  
That still doesn’t seem to stop them from thinking it was a dick move and are turning it into a whole family drama because they think it was unfair to “punish” them for simply believing in something different. AITA?

She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.

My issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).

I asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn’t appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave.

Since then, she hasn’t answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA?

So my husband called his mum and dad on Facetime, while I stayed out of view to make sure he said exactly what needed to be said. He explained that her behaviour to our daughter is unacceptable and that it's not fair she is subjecting her to this sort of treatment. He explained that if it was her biological grandson receiving this sort of treatment from my mum, she would be absolutely livid and be the first to call her a racist. What she was doing was no different.

His father apologised and agreed with what he said. He tried to coax MIL to apologise but she huffed and said 'I have nothing to apologise for, that child is not ours and never will be.' My husband and FIL both argued that she was being heartless and my husband warned her if she continued to treat our daughter this way, she would not be allowed to see our baby.

She flipped. She called me a lot of racist names I won't repeat on here. She also said she would see her grandbaby whether he liked it or not, that I was a bad influence, that I was manipulating him and turning her son against him. Eventually my FIL apologised and ended the call.

We had a sit down with my daughter and explained that she couldn't see Grandma because she was in a 'time out'. My daughter asked if it was because she 'says mean things' and we both said yes. She then asked 'When she comes out of time out, can I see her again'? and I said 'absolutely, once she is out of time out you can go and visit with your new brother or sister'. She seemed satisfied with that as she then asked if she could go and play in the garden.

My husband has since been texting our FIL, but she refuses to apologise. Until she does and takes steps to improving her behaviour, she will not be allowed to visit.

Thank you for all your advice on the matter, we both agreed with a lot of the comments that now was not the time to bring her race up to our daughter as she doesn't see herself any different from her dad or his parents. She seems to be ok with it so far, although we are taking it day by day.

We’re from England, where the correct response to rain is to not acknowledge it, but things are a little different in Japan. It is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. I warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. They were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained.

I warned them multiple times that if it rains, I would not let them borrow my umbrella.

One friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. I reminded them that I would not share a few more times while we were walking. 

Roughly an hour later, it started raining. Hard. It was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. I stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). When we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. Neither were particularly happy.

"AITA for not allowing my niece to use ""promised"" money from my grandma's estate to go to college? My family is derisively calling me ""Scott's Tots"" in order to get me to bend and give in, and it's sort of working.",22748,Not the A-hole,2528,cqty1q,1565922997.0,"Edit: for all the people asking, Scott's Tots is an episode of the The Office, the plot is Michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. He assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. The episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. I've seen it called the ""best unwatchable episode of TV ever"" because it's so cringe worthy. I've watched the office 8 times and I skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. Parks n' Rec is a better show though...fight me. 

So how do I begin with this. I am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. My grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who I call niece because I truly don't understand all the ""removed"" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. The condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise I would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. The stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (I really hope this is making sense). Basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do I get to keep it long term. 

My cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to University of Arizona so she can start next week. Either they didn't know or didn't care about the GPA requirement because when I asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. I don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 GPA. I asked her how she got into UofA and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. 

I basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my Grandma's will and that I will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  

That's when all hell broke loose. My mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. My sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that I'm running my own version of ""Scott's Tots"" because I taking away money that was promised for education. There's also an undertone that I'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so I can save it for myself if they don't go to college. 

No amount of explanation is helping. I've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can I keep their shares. IF they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. No one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and I imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). 

There is really nothing stopping me from doing it. I write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what I'm doing. 

I have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the Scott's Tots thing because I don't want to be seen like that. 

Would I be the asshole if I withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?

AITA for taking crappy holiday photos because my MIL didn't want me in the photos?,22732,Not the A-hole,1513,eewz6x,1577194708.0,"
I married my wife Lia two months ago. I'm also a woman for the record. Lia's mom seems to have a problem with me, or my sexuality or something, Lia is bi and her mom seems to wish she'd stayed with one of her male exes.

So anyway at Christmas, we were taking photos and her mom was like ""OP, we want the photos to be family only.."" Lia started to protest, like ""we're married, mom"" but I didn't want an argument so I said ""it's ok, I'll take the pictures."" 

It was kind of cringy because lia's sister's husband, and cousin and his wife and son were there so there were definitely spouses and children included

 I was kind of annoyed and decided to not take the best ones... Just on purpose, focused the camera on the furniture rather than people, snapped pictures zoomed in awkwardly close, used unflattering flash, didn't hold my hands steady so they were blurry, took pictures on purpose when someone was looking away or coughing or something.

Anyway I took like 30 pictures and they ranged from bad to horrible. And I gave the camera back and said that I hope they find a nice one to frame in there.

After everything, Lia was angry on my behalf, said her mom had no right to treat me like that and I didn't have to say ""it's ok"" when it was totally rude. And I just started laughing and told her what I'd done. We snuck down to the dining room later that night and she lost it laughing at the pictures I'd taken. She even deleted some of the more decent ones.

We're still waiting for her mom to plug her camera into the computer and see the pictures. We're planning on saying I tried my best but didn't know how to use a dslr camera if anyone says something

AITA for telling someone she’s the common denominator in her failed friendships?,22736,Not the A-hole,1786,gzkypd,1591729429.0,"I’ve been with my parter for a year now and have met most of his friends. He’s very close to his friend group from high school which I think is very sweet. His best friend is getting married next year, and my bf is one of his groomsmen so we’ve been spending more time with his friend group lately. 

I’m admittedly not super keen on one of his friends (S) but I’ve always just chalked it up to personality differences. She’s quite loud and dominates conversation a lot, but it’s not like I don’t like her, I just find her a bit much. 

We were in a zoom with bfs friends, shooting shit and the wedding came up. At one point we were talking about outfits etc and S said how much she hates shopping and was dreading going shopping. She made a weird comment about how she’s so not girly and ‘one of the guys’ which I found immature, she’s a grown woman after all, but I didn’t say anything. 

S asked if I knew what I was wearing and I said no, but I had planned to go shopping with a friend of mine who also had an event coming up. I was going to ask S if she’d like to come with us, but she interrupted saying ‘Oh, that’s so cute! I just don’t like stuff like that, I don’t hang out with other girls, I just prefer being with the guys.’ Which I found really patronising to be honest. It was clear I was annoyed, and the conversation kind of took a turn.

Me: So you have never had a friendship with another woman before?

S: No I have, I just find a lot of girls petty and catty, don’t you?

Me: No I don’t. I’m friends with lots of women, we compliment each other, go shopping together and occasionally share pastries sometimes.

S: Oh I could never, girls always talk behind my back!

Me: You know, if every single relationship you’ve ever had with another woman has gone sour, there’s a common denominator there, and it’s not the fact that they’re other women, it’s probably you. 

A couple others laughed, and tried to move onto a different topic of conversation, but it was clear S was angry. She logged off early and later texted my boyfriend and said I was way out of line. He replied and told her he didn’t think so, and if she was one of the guys she should be used to a bit of gentle ribbing every now and then. 

I feel a bit bad because all though I felt hurt by her comments, she seems quite insecure to me, plus it’s not really my friendship group so I may have been a bit over bearing. AITA?",False,1591700850.0,2020-06-09 12:03:49
AITA - for not allowing someone to propose during my wedding reception and for planning on not going to their wedding?,22714,Not the A-hole,3234,ej5jdk,1578033195.0,"Longtime lurker, first time account/posting - I’ve debated posting this for a while now, but since I’ve been so vocal the last few days on this subreddit I figured it was time to find out if I was TA instead of just commenting on others.

My wedding was September 21st, 2019. We had a fairly decent sized wedding. My cousin (on my stepdads side - we are not close whatsoever) and her boyfriend have only been dating not even 6 months at this point. I’ve met the guy once before my wedding and he never shows up to any family functions. We’re all having a great time at my wedding. My husband and I are mingling with guest while everyone dances. 

The next thing I know is my cousins boyfriend asks the DJ for his mike and goes to the center of the dance floor saying he has an “announcement” to make and calls my cousin over. So, I rush over and say, “Nope, no one is getting engaged during my special day especially during my reception. You can get engaged later tonight but not right now. It’s my day. Thank you for understanding.” and I go to walk away. My cousin starts puffing and my aunt (her mom) starts yelling at me and calling me an entitled brat. It causes a huge fight and they all end up leaving. My mom, stepdad, dad, and stepmom all are on my side and were even pissed that they think its okay to do that during a wedding they all paid for. My nana (step dads mom) says I was wrong and told me to apologize and call them over and allow him to propose. Needless to say, it didn’t happen. 

Flash forward to Christmas. Ugh, it was terrible! My stepdads entire side were rude and ignoring my husband and I. And of course, guess what happens! My cousin and her now fiancé announced their wedding date - September 21st, 2020! 

I’m beyond pissed and so not planning to go. It’s my damn one year wedding anniversary! My family is upset that they would do that to piss me off for not allowing them to get engaged during my reception. My cousin says they chose to get married on their one year engagement anniversary. Either way, regardless of the real reason, I’m still upset. Of course, my nana is super excited. 

So reddit, aita for not allowing them to get engaged during my wedding reception and aita for not attending the wedding on my one year anniversary?

UPDATE: AITA for not agreeing to house my pregnant teenage sister and her delinquent boyfriend after our parents disowned her?,22662,UPDATE,707,d3v9kl,1568436008.0,"[OG Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cvzd4t/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_house_my_pregnant/)

It's been a little bit more than two weeks since my first post and I guess it's safe to say now that the situation has been resolved in probably the best way possible!!

In my last post, I stated that my sister was still living in the car of her delinquent boyfriend who sells drugs and refusing to come home because my parents had disowned her. At this point, I would like to clarify that my family and I are Chinese and it is common in Chinese culture to ""disown"" your kids when they do something that largely disappoints or embarrasses you. However, this is not a permanent disownment like many of you have brought up; as long as my sister apologizes sincerely and they can see that she is actively trying to fix her mistake and become better, they will take her back as their daughter. (Another clarification would be for those people who assumed that my dad kept us poor since he was stubborn and wanted to work on his business and not get a real job. His business was a passion project on the side. My dad was working 50 hours a week at two jobs.)

Alrighty, onto what ultimately happened with my sister. Despite the chain of advice I sent her, she ignored me still. I regularly checked in with her over the next week to see how she was and she gave me one word replies until they ultimately stopped. I was growing concerned after she didn't pick up her cell, but then I received a call from my parents!!! According to my mom, my sister had returned home crying and begging for forgiveness. She had a serious talk with my parents where she apologized for her behavior and promised to make amends. My mom was very tearful as well. They scheduled a doctor's appointment for her immediately and I believe she went in the next day.

I had no idea what made her finally break and return home so I texted her (first, I told her I was proud of her for taking action and being mature) and asked if anything happened between her and her boyfriend. At first she was pretty stubborn and kept insisting that she was just over living in a car, but after a while she finally admitted that her boyfriend had requested that *she start selling for him if she wanted to keep living in his car and eating his food that he was sneaking her*. LMAO. What a fucking asshole. Glad my sister finally returned to her senses. She told me she broke it off with him and I sincerely hope that's the truth.

This past Monday, she got the pills to successfully terminate her pregnancy. According to my mom, she was begging that they do is ASAP, which was really a breath of relief for all of us because we were worried she might want to keep it.

The future seems pretty bright right now for her. My parents decided to pull her out of the public school and send her to a progressive private school that some of my close friends also went to (it's a fantastic school and I think it'd be great for her). She's officially starting next Monday. I'm going to visit her and my family this weekend and see how she's doing. :)

TL;DR: Sis returned home safely and apologized to parents. Delinquent bf was forcing her to sell drugs for him in repayment for the hospitality that he has provided her in the form of the backseat of his car and McDonald's. Sis terminated the pregnancy and will be attending a new school next week.

EDIT: Forgot to add that the new school also has a wonderful counseling department. I urged my parents to speak to the head psychologist there and they did and she will be having mandatory weekly meetings with her and another therapist at the school. :)",True,1568412215.0,2019-09-13 21:40:08

AITA for not shaving my legs for work?,22588,Not the A-hole,1636,ct8w0a,1566375668.0,"So I’m a 21 year old female. I feel like I should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out I rarely shave my legs. I’m straight, I’m very feminine, and I just don’t like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. Also I’m not a hairy person at all! You can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. The only time I shave is when I’m dating a new guy in my life and I’ve been with my current BF for 3 years now. Also he doesn’t give a rats ass if I shave my legs. 

So I work for a promotion company where I travel and work at event and festivals. But today I had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so I stoped to say hi before I left out. 

When I ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. I said sure and came in and he shut the door. He was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. I was in literal shock. I was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. My boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained I didn’t shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that I wasn’t being hygienic. I was even more shocked. 

I told him I didn’t understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. I asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. I then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this I’d prefer HR to be there and he just told me that we didn’t need to discuss it any further. 

Later today I just got an email from HR saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. I’m freaking out and it’s making me so anxious.
AITA for not shaving my legs for my job?

EDIT: So people giving my boss hate i understand but I’m not mad at him and don’t blame him. Im not sure but I feel like someone was in fact pressuring him to talk to me about this because he is a usually very chill and a nice guy who usually doesn’t even force dress code and stuff.

AITA for treating my two daughters' pregnancies differently?,22584,Not the A-hole,3463,gaw4yl,1588283837.0,"When my oldest told me she was pregnant, she was still in college, unemployed and the baby's father was refusing to be involved. I was not thrilled but I provided all the help I could and took care of her. I was having a health crisis at the time so I was very stressed out. I love my grandchild but the birth didn't exactly happen in the happiest of circumstances.

My oldest daughter ended up back in a relationship with the baby's father and they are happy and stable now. 

My younger daughter announced her pregnancy a few months ago and the situation cannot be more different. She's married to her husband who she's been with for several years, they're both financially stable and the baby is clearly planned.

I have had zero stress dealing with my daughter's pregnancy this time and I've been generally happier about it. I was unknowingly proving I was more excited this time around which I have since corrected. I also planned a baby shower for my youngest which I didn't do for my oldest.

My oldest is furious. I can imagine why but I feel she should understand how different the circumstances were.

She's said some really hurtful things to me and has prevented me from seeing my grandchild, even on the phone. I have already apologized a few times but it hasn't made a difference.

My youngest is now having some pregnancy related health issues and we're feeling very scared. I got a text from my oldest yesterday that if it were her having a health scare during her pregnancy, I would've probably celebrated. I broke down crying because I was so hurt.

UPDATE: AITA for refusing to sell my rental properties at my fiance's request?,22590,UPDATE,1337,gzrzhj,1591753350.0,"The original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/fcxvc2/aita\_for\_refusing\_to\_sell\_my\_rental\_properties\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/fcxvc2/aita_for_refusing_to_sell_my_rental_properties_at/)

So, 'the conversation' didn't happen until the weekend of the 14th of March.  Life got in the way.  

It started fine, but quickly went south and ended in a big fight that degenerated into a lot of petty shit-slinging by the end.  She accused me of not trusting her (fair) and I pointed out that her habits make it basically impossible to trust her with money anyway...probably not my proudest moment.  But, I did again make it clear in no uncertain terms that the properties are staying in the LLC and I won't sell them, and that the financial decisions regarding them would be mine alone.  I may have also had a few choice words about the princess-for-a-day wedding she wanted.  

After a couple of weeks of avoiding each other, and not talking, and me sleeping in the basement of the townhouse, I said I wanted to hit the pause button and leave for a while.  She was upset but didn't say much.  I loaded up my things and went to my parents' house and told them what happened.  They told me I could stay as long as I needed.  

Somewhere near the end of April, I got a call from her dad out of the blue (what the hell) demanding to know what was going on and why I'd broken things off.  I tried to explain what had been going on but he was the angry dad of an upset young woman and i don't think much got through.  That call ended with him calling me a scumbag and hanging up on me.  I've only had a few properly long-term relationships end in my lifetime, but that's the first time I've had an angry father yell at me about one.  

There's been no contact since.  I'm sad that just over four years of my life with someone went up in smoke like this, but that's the way she goes I guess.  My parents didn't seem very surprised when I showed up, so maybe I really was the last one to know what was going on, like so many redditors were pointing out.  

For some good news, and also the thing that reminded me to update my reddit post, is that yesterday I bought another house, one for me to live in.  A tiny little brick postwar brick ranch in an old subdivision about 20 minutes from my rentals.   It needs work but I'm looking forward to having a prjoect to take my mind off things.  It's going to be strange living on my own again, but I think I'll manage.",False,1591760705.0,2020-06-09 18:42:30

AITA for rejecting a disabled girl's prom asking?,22457,Not the A-hole,2062,f7l1s5,1582362159.0,"Alright so today was quite traumatic for me. I'm a high school senior (18M) and promposal season is currently in full swing. 

I was in my AP chem class when suddenly an entourage of people entered my classroom with a disabled girl (she has cerebral palsy) that I know. I first saw the posters and the bouquet of flowers she was holding and thought, ""aww that's sweet of her."" Then they revealed the posters and I read my name and was completely taken aback. I literally almost had a fucking anxiety attack. I didn't know what to say at all and the entire class was cheering and people even started filming. I was straight up frozen for a minute and I could feel myself burning up with embarrassment. Of course I wanted to say no, but since it was so public and everyone was waiting for me to say yes, I did and hugged her. Everyone clapped including the teacher and I was mortified. 

One of my buddies asked me if I was okay afterwards since apparently I looked like I was gonna burst into tears and I told him I literally did not expect that at all and I didn't want to say yes. He suggested that I go find her after school or something and explain that to her and I agreed. Now, this girl is really  nice. We had a class together last year and sat next to each other for a majority of it and talked quite a lot. I would say we were friends then, but we haven't spoken more than two times this school year so we've definitely drifted apart. That's why I was completely shocked when she sprung the prom asking on me; usually, people have their friends make sure that the other is at least aware before doing the asking to prevent situations like this. I was contemplating if I should just bite the bullet and go with her, but decided I just couldn't because it is my senior year prom and I was already starting to plan my asking. There's this girl that I've liked for a couple of months now and I recently heard from my friends that she likes me back so I was gonna ask her. 

So I ended up going to the special ed classroom after school where I found her and asked if I could speak to her outside. I told her everything and how I really, really appreciated the gesture, but I was already planning on asking my crush to prom and she was CRUSHED. She started crying really loudly and asked me why I couldn't of just said no and I said that I didn't want to embarrass the two of us in front of all those people. At this point, one of her aids came out to check on us since she could hear the crying and the girl told her aid what happened and she straight up glared at me and said, ""That's not okay.""

AITA for telling my parents to stop hooking me up with single girls from their church? AITA for not wanting to get married?,22395,Not the A-hole,1344,gnugc5,1590086072.0,"The last year and a half has been hard for me, to say the least.

Last March, my brilliant and hilarious and beautiful girlfriend Natalie suddenly passed away.  Everyone always gave shit about us because of politics.  We met in college when were were poly sci majors: she is very liberal (think AOC) and I'm pretty conservative.  We actually met because we were serving as treasurers for our school's College Democrats and Young Republicans clubs, respectively, and our groups would get together for drinks or bowling or laser tag once a month.  

Well, Natalie and I bonded over a lot of shared interests and we hit it off.  Even if we didn't see eye to eye on many issues, debating her was stimulating and formed the cornerstone of our relationship.  We've had debates that went on until dawn.  We just bounced off each other.  She liked to joke that we were ""drift compatible"".  

I wanted to marry this woman, but she passed away before we got a chance to talk about marriage.  I'm in therapy and I'm working through working through not having her in my life anymore, but it's been rough.  Then 'Rona happened and I got laid off, so I had to move back in with my parents and figure out what I am supposed to do now.

My parents mean well, but they got married really young and are more conservative and religious than me.  They've been trying to set me up on dates with single girls from their church since I moved back home.  But I don't want to date these girls.

No offense to them, but it's a small town in the American Breadbasket.  They don't share the same interests as me and it feels like their only goal in life is to be a good Christian wife and produce a lot of babies.  Trying to talk to them about current events is excruciating for me.  The girls my parents tried to set me up with take everything they read on Facebook or hear from Fox News for face value.  It makes me miss Natalie and our debates more. 

My parents mean well.  I know they want me to find a nice girl and settle down with her, but not like this.  They are nothing like Natalie and never will be.  I miss her, even if my folks didn't like her ideas.  

But when I told them the other night that I wanted them to stop setting me up on dates with these girls, they freaked out and told me that I needed to consider settling down since I just turned thirty.  They're good girls from great families, I know that, and my parents like them more than they liked Natalie, but she was my one and only.  I don't think it's fair for anyone when I still love her.  

They are even more angry at me because I told them that I just don't see myself getting married anytime soon.  But like I said, Natalie was my soulmate and I just can't see myself being with anyone else but her.  Yet, they are insisting that I need to find a woman and settle down and give them grandchildren.

Edit:  We were seriously close to talking about marriage.  But around the time she died, it was more like how funny it would be if the bridal party wore blue and the groomsmen wore red because the bride is a Democrat and the groom is a Republican/Romeo and Juliet deal.

Fuck, I wish we got to do that.  Natalie thought it was hilarious.

He’s been my best friend for a long time and we’re so close people ask us all the time if we are siblings because we look alike AND even share a last name. He lives close by and is very much integrated into all parts of my life. 

I had a crush on him growing up and I asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. He always declined and said we were just best friends. He’s really goofy with me, and treats me like I’m his little sister and over time I came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. My parents treat him like a son and honestly, he’s family. 

A couple months ago I had a ONS and found out I was pregnant. Being as I have PCOS I am OVER THE MOON because I was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. I am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and I cant explain how many tears of relief I shed. I’ve always wanted to be a mom and finally I have a chance at this. I have my own home, have savings, I’m in the right place in life and I’m so happy. 

When James found out he was also over the moon. He thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore.

I found that so demeaning and hurtful, and I burst out crying and called him an immature asshole and told him to GTFO. He apologized and left and I haven’t heard from him since.

AITA for donating my daughters college fund instead of giving it to my step daughter to help buy a house,22247,Not the A-hole,3023,epmdeh,1579224095.0,"So I have a 16 year old daughter that passed away in a car accident October 19th. I’ve been collecting a college fund for her since she was young, my ex husband and I both put money into it as well as she put some of her paychecks from work into it, and it’s about $25,000 full. I recently got remarried to a man who has a 30 year old daughter. My step daughter doesn’t like me, because I’m only 3 years older than her, my husband is significantly older than I am. 


My daughter was very passionate about the environment, and my ex husband and I discussed what we would do with the college fund. My husband says it was my daughter and I can do what I feel is right to honor her. 

We decided to divide it and we would each donate to charities we felt would make our daughter proud. 

My step daughter however thinks we should split it evenly and she should get some cushion for buying a house, since I’m married to her father and that makes my contribution his money too. 

She thinks donating *essentially* $13000 wouldn’t mean anything to a big charity and I could help someone I know in real life.


My husband has since joined her side and thinks $13000 would help her buy a house and we can honor my daughter in another way.


AITA for not wanting to change my plans?


Edit: there seems to be some confusion and I’m so sorry for  wording it poorly


My ex husband and I, and a little bit my daughter are the sole people putting money into the fund. My current husband has not put any money into the fund from his personal finances. 

My step daughter and my biological daughter did not have a relationship, as my step daughter is almost twice her age. 

I am 33, my husband is 58. We have a joint house account, as well as separate personal funds. 

My step daughter has brought this up multiple times, it wasn’t just a suggestion, she constantly brings it up. 

My step daughter is also not poor off financially. She can afford a house, she is single, my husband helped her pay off her debt before we got married. She just wants some cushion.


Edit #2: I am dividing the funds with my ex husband, not my husband now. My ex husband gets half to do with as he pleases to honor our daughter. My current husband gets nothing.",True,1579248449.0,2020-01-16 17:21:35
AITA for denying water to a group of women who were supposedly dehydrated as they refused to pay?,22185,Not the A-hole,4260,cir8t6,1564314663.0,"A very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. I’ve never objected to people crossing our land as I’m an avid hiker and don’t want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.

Anyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. It’s basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. So she’ll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it’s a multi day hike). 

It made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.

Now, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. It “feels like” 40-45 degrees Celsius during June-July. Today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. They said they were out of water and asked if I could refill their water bottles. I told them I could for 50cents a bottle. The reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). We aren’t connected to an endless supply of water.

They were furious that I refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. I told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (I’ve drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted I top them up. 

They had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. So I refilled the young girl’s bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. They refused and very angrily went on their way. My wife says I should have filled them up, but IMO so long as the little girl is okay I don’t think they deserved anything given their attitude.",True,False,2019-07-28 04:51:03

Everyone was having a good time and there were about 20 of us there (from about 30 people in our department). I go to the bathroom, and as I am about to exit the hall to the bathroom I hear my co-worker say my name from around the corner of the wall. Perhaps I shouldn't have eavesdropped, but curiosity/suspicion got the best of me and I did.

I overheard a conversation of three guys in my department making a ""hot list"" (they actually referred to it as that), which involved ranking every woman in the department from first to last. I was upset and disturbed. I was quite friendly with 2/3 of the guys, actually. Yesterday morning I tell HR and they state that they have a zero-tolerance policy for actions like this. All three men were fired first thing this morning, and now I feel terrible.

I hated the way they were talking about women, but I didn't think they should be fired. With that said, we work for a large company that I know takes complaints like this seriously, and would not really miss these 3 guys, so deep down I suppose I knew it was a possibility when I complained. Nobody knows that I am the person who reported them, and I've overheard people say that the person is a ""snitch"". I'm wondering if I should have just confronted them at the bar and told them how it made me feel instead, but at the time I didn't feel comfortable doing that. I especially feel bad because I had a fairly good relationship with two of the guys.

AITA?

INFO 1: It was not a formal work event, but our supervisor organized everyone going out for drinks

INFO 2: A lot of people are insisting that I am upset because I was low on the list. I tried to avoid making this the focus, but with all the comments I feel like I have to address it. I was high on the list, and was not offended about my placement; I was offended about the fact that they were making a list in the first place. I hate that I even have to write this

I was in the break room at work and my coworker Arthur who tends to talk a lot about politics... Got to talking about politics. 

It was me, my coworker John who I'm good friends with, Adam who I don't know too well, and Arthur in the room. I was kinda sitting back from the discussion because I wanted to chill and eat lunch.

But it kind of annoyed me that Arthur was making comments about women getting abortions without knowing what they're getting into, making impulse decisions because they're scared of Parenthood. As if this is a big thing that happens often.

I spoke up and said I didn't think it was like that; our state has mandatory counseling and meetings to make sure the person is giving informed consent. And I didn't think anyone was going about it willy nilly without knowing what they were doing.

He got kind of blustery, saying ""how do you know that they don't just rush you through that, tick a few boxes?""

I said that when I'd had mine, I had a very practical and informative counseling session that gave me a lot of information on my options, what I'd expect from the procedure, what my specific risks of continuing with a pregnancy would be, due to a medical condition of mine. And I didn't feel at all like I was doing something I didn't understand.

It was really awkwardly silent for a bit. Arthur told me that wasn't appropriate for me to have said at work, and it's something I ought to keep quieter. I bit back the childish urge to comment that he started it. 

Later, John, my friend from work said he thought it was funny, how I threw Arthur's assumptions in his face, but he thinks I ought to be a little more careful because Arthur is probably gonna think differently of me now. 

I don't feel ashamed to talk about it, but I do see how it was a lot to say at work...

AITA for not marrying the girl I'm supposed to be and causing major problems for my family?,22126,Not the A-hole,1660,hefhgy,1592950959.0,"This will sound unbelievable to those not from my country. All I can say is that it is real.

When I was 5, my parents brought my dad’s friend’s daughter X (about 3) to live with me and sister Y (7). X’s family was poor and couldn’t support their children (they had 6) so they sent X here because they really trusted my parents. 

X, Y, and I grew up together, and my parents were awesome to all three of us. I had a lot of fun growing up and I am extremely close to my family.  

I’m now 29. Three years back, I went abroad for my masters and then went back to my country. There, I met a girl P and we fell in love. I’d like to propose soon and felt like this would be a good time to introduce P to my family (Y already knew of her and P just graduated). 

This weekend I told my family that I would like for them to meet someone special and set-up a video call. No idea who they were expecting, but when they realized P was my girlfriend, everything just blew up.  

Apparently, they had already “discussed and arranged” my marriage with X years back, and she was the one I would have to marry. X was aware, her father had told her. Cue lots of screaming and yelling, including some choice words from X to P about how she’s a “modern girl” (euphemism in my culture for slut) and how she must be after me for my money (she comes from a richer family). I was just too shocked to react initially. 

The next day I told my parents that I look at X as family. They started saying ridiculous things like they’ve never let her into my room (while apparently Y was allowed) and drawing all sorts of other parallels between X and Y trying to demonstrate why X wasn’t like my sister. They also said stuff like no one can understand me better than X and that she will “keep the family together” while P will “alienate” me from them. They also told me I’m ruining the family.

X also cried nonstop and then shut herself in the room, accusing me of not wanting her only because she was poor amongst other things. She also said no one from her village would marry her now because her family has told everyone back home that she’s going to be marrying me. 

My sister was not aware of any of this either. 

Now – I told X I don’t care that no one will marry her from her village (it is a likely possibility) or that her life is “ruined”. I also told my parents I won’t ruin my life for them to be able to “keep their word”. X’s father is coming to our house once he’s able to (transport restrictions still in place), but he had a long phone call with parents. I’m sure a LOT of emotional blackmail is to follow, and I already feel rather guilty about X because she’s a nice girl. 

My sister is on my side. But even if my parents cut me off and at the risk of X ruining her life, I am not going to go ahead with this at all. AITA?

Edit: A lot of people asking me where I'm from - It's a SE Asian country, just don't want to say if it's the exact place you guys are asking about. 

X was apparently aware I didn't know. But she was told by my parents and hers that I'm a ""Family man"" and will do the ""right thing"" so there's no need to worry. She's basically accused me of wrecking the family too. 

My sister is really upset on my behalf, and also that she wasn't told any of this. My sister's family (her husband and his parents) have said if there's any sort of confrontation, they'll be there to back me up.

Not sure if this detail counts, but P is also from my country but also came abroad to study. So that's not a reason as to why my parents are unaccepting of P. They just want me to marry X.",False,1592929406.0,2020-06-23 15:22:39

It's been pretty awkward. I was kicked out of her wedding party because I was uncomfortable wearing a very revealing bridesmaid's gown. This wasn't that big of a deal as we're not exactly close since she got with my ex. However, she still expects me to take on all the duties of a bridesmaid. I told her that was ridiculous and that she needed to find a new bridesmaid. She then almost uninvited me from the wedding but instead decided I could go I follow a very specific set of rules (ranging from how to dress to who I could talk to). I was absolutely crushed as I was still looking forward to the wedding even if I wasn't going to be in it. I found out through a mutual friend who is still in the wedding party the bride continuously makes fun of me and talks shit about me constantly and so do several of the other bridesmaids. I was about to just not go when I ran into the bride's ex who is also invited to the wedding (He's the groom's cousin).

He and I have decided we're going to go together and have fun breaking as many rules that we can (such as wearing what we want to wear, drinking at the open bar, talking to whoever we want to, and dancing- WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DANCE). Nothing we would do would distract from the bride's big day other than breaking the ridiculously petty rules that we're supposed to follow. We're also both at the point where we're both ready to sever ties with the bride and groom. Would we be the assholes?

AITA for sleeping over at my gfs 4 nights a week making her roommate uncomfortable and causing her to flip out?,22101,Asshole,4209,cpa8mv,1565632457.0,"Let me preface this by saying that I (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call Liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. I've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. This is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. I'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.

Now, I've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. I've tried my best to get to know Bianca but it's not reciprocated and I can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. She's never asked a question about what I do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.

Liv told me that Bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. I hate being the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.

Here's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. 
We both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.

Their relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I can't help but feel responsible. 

On an end note, Liv and I want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.

My mates telling me I'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and I should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. But I see it as the next step before moving in together, that I'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in.

AITA for not giving my daughter a letter my deceased husband wrote for her before he died?,22150,Asshole,1451,hc408d,1592613625.0,"In January of 2019, my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumour. It was in a completely inoperable part of the brain, and was told me had six months to live. He stuck it out and died in October, three months longer than he was expected to. He was always positive, and decided a few weeks after his diagnosis that he would write letters for our daughters for significant events in their lives. My husband was my soulmate, and the past few months have been difficult knowing I’ve lost him 

We have two daughters, Mia who is 21 and Imogen (Immy) who is 19. All three of us have become a lot closer since their dads death, and we’ve all really struggled. My husband and I were together since we were children, got married when we were 18 and we were approaching our 20th wedding anniversary when he passed. 

In February of this year, Mia got married to a boy she’s been with for about 6 years. I absolutely love her husband and he’s been incredibly supportive during all of our grief. My husband wrote a letter for Mia to open on her wedding day. It’s worth noting that my daughters were unaware of these letters, it was my job to give them to our daughters. 

Her wedding day comes around and I just can’t bring myself to give her the letter. I read it and just wanted to keep it to myself. I had his handwriting and his words and it felt like he was there, and I couldn’t bare the thought of giving that up yet. I was fully intending on giving her all the other letters as the events happened. 

Last week Mia and her husband bought their first home together. They’d been living at our home since they got married, and so had a lot of stuff to pack and move to their new house. Mia asked me where her important documents were, passport, birth certificate etc, so I told her they were in my top drawer of my dresser in my bedroom. The only letter that was in there was the one I was meant to give her on her wedding day, the rest were hidden away. 

She immediately recognised his handwriting and of course it was addressed to her, so she read it and broke down. She came and found me and started screaming at me asking how I could be so selfish. I didn’t really know what to say apart from the fact that I wanted to keep it and she could take a picture of it. Both my daughters called me an asshole and are convinced I’m keeping them from a load of their dads stuff. AITA?

AITA for using home security cameras to expose my girlfriend’s gaslighting?,22061,Not the A-hole,2722,fv0x9z,1586061688.0,"My GF Anne (25F) and I (25M) have been dating the past 5 years, since college. After graduation, we were semi-long distance, living close enough that we alternately visited almost every weekend. In 2018, Anne got a job in my city, and we found a place and moved in together.

Now’s a good time to mention the security cameras in our house: break-ins are unfortunately common where we live. We thus got some motion activated cameras, one of which has a view of our kitchen (to monitor the back door). The cameras only record when there’s motion so they can retain footage for a very long time. Anne of course knows this.

About a year ago, Anne started complaining I wasn’t contributing equally to chores. I’ve been obsessive about chores my whole life; growing up, not doing the dishes meant no videogames for a week. When I lived with roommates, I was always the chore Nazi, making damn sure we all stuck to our chore wheel. Anne is just as fastidious about chores, so we just naturally alternated who did what.

I’d just been brushing her remarks off, but over the last few months they’ve become much more aggressive, e.g. I was vacuuming and Anne said “look at you finally cleaning up around here!” I replied that we alternated vacuuming, to which she retorted “no, you’ve vacuumed maybe twice since I moved in.” Exchanges like this have been happening so frequently that I began to doubt my own recollection; am I not as clean as I thought?

Finally, she exploded at me last week. She said that having to stay home constantly over the past weeks exposed how little I do around the house, and that she didn’t move in just to be my maid. Questioning my own sanity, I spent a few hours going through the entire 1.5 year archive of security camera footage, and tallied the exact number of times the kitchen cam caught each of us doing dishes. Our cleaning supplies (vacuum/mop/etc.) are in the kitchen pantry, so I also tallied up how many times we grabbed cleaning stuff.

To my vindication, the tally showed that we indeed split chores equally. She vacuumed/mopped \~5 more times than I did; I did dishes \~20 more times than she did. Given that we vacuum/mop at least once a week and do dishes at least every day, these are insignificant differences over the year and a half we’ve lived together.

When I confronted Anne, she shrugged off her behavior as “remembering things differently,” but the real sin here was what *I* did, which she called an “unforgivable violation of *her* privacy,” akin to abusive stalking. She has broken up with me and is trying to move out, although obviously this is difficult due to current circumstances.

I’m totally heartbroken - Anne was the love of my life and I can’t believe she destroyed our relationship like this. To make matters worse, she told many of our friends, who are mostly siding with her! They’ve been texting me that what I did was creepy, abusive, controlling, invasive, etc. I’m at a loss; I’m beginning to think I’m the one who’s off base here.

Edit: some people thought I vacuumed ""5x more"" and she did dishes ""20x more,"" I clarified the wording that it was literally 5 _more times_/20 _more times_, total, over 1.5 years.",False,1586061475.0,2020-04-04 21:41:28
AITA for booking up an entire row of seats just for myself?,22050,Not the A-hole,1929,fpctvz,1585263229.0,"For reference this, all happened before the lockdown and orders to shelter in place. 

I (32f) broke my leg in two places a couple of months ago and was placed in a full leg cast. I took convalescent leave and decided to fly to my home state. I'm originally from CA but stationed in NC this is relevant so everyone understands the time frame for the flight in question. 

To avoid any added pain and to be able to prop my leg up I paid for the entire row of seats. Thank God for miles points. Flying can cause swelling so I wanted to alleviate it for myself as much as possible. When I got onto my flight I sat in the window seat and stretched my leg out across the seats. 

When everyone else started boarding a couple approached me asking if anyone was sitting next to me. I said no, no one is sitting next to me because I bought out the entire row of seats. So the husband (an older man maybe mid-40s?) asked if they could use the vacant seats because she wanted to sit next to his wife. I POLITELY told him I'm sorry sir but no I need them that's why I paid for all three. He kept at it but I stood firm that these were my seats. 

The called the flight attendant came over because we were starting to make a scene and asked me to put my leg down and not occupy the other seats. I again explained I paid for all three seats and showed her the tickets. She told me while I did pay for the seats I was being rather selfish as it was a booked up flight and said couldn't I just be more accommodating to others. 

I was extremely pissed off at this point I mean it was blatant I had a broken leg. I told her no I'm not going up my seats not sitting together is the risk you take if you book late. I pointed down at my cast and said shouldn't you be more accomodating to me actually considering I'm the one with an obvious medical issue? 

They left calling me a selfish bitch. But I don't think I was I paid for all three seats so I wouldn't inconvenience anyone else. I've talked it over with some friends and most are on my side while others have said I was a bit of an AH I should have just given up the seats and sucked it up. But it was a 5+ hour flight for fuck's sake.

Edit: so I don't have to keep repeating myself here. 


* I'm female lol.


* The flight was United. 


* No sitting at the bulkhead or exit wouldn't have helped because I needed to prop my leg up. Also being that I was physically compromised sitting at the exit with limited capacity I would have been unable perform the tasks required in the unlikely event of there being an emergency.


* Business class offered extra leg room but again doesn't help with needing to prop my leg up.

I don't even drink, except for on special occasions where I'll have two or three drinks at most.

Now, my older brother and his wife have been together since shortly before I had my bad relapse, and she's convinced that I'm just a ticking time bomb waiting to relapse again. The first year or so, I understood her concerns and she wasn't the only person who had them. However, it's been almost six years since I was anywhere near the stuff and she *still* won't have that I'm gonna stay clean.

She's very vocal about these concerns, too. If I get sick, she tells our entire family that she thinks I've relapsed again and I'm having withdrawals. She made a huge scene on Christmas day two years ago because I had a cold and was a bit sniffly and she decided that I must have been doing a ton of coke. If anything goes missing from any of the family's houses, she accuses me of having stolen it for drug money. I mostly just grin and bear it so as not to make waves, but recently she took it a step too far. 

I went away recently with some friends. On the first day of my trip, I dropped and broke my phone.

To people asking whether my in-laws are really named Jake and Leah — no, it comes from a bible story, and I thought I’d be clever with the aliases. 

To people asking why I haven’t intervened before in my sister’s relationship — I’ve tried to gently bring it up, but I was worried about hurting her or being wrong. My partner and I are currently stuck in my home state due to COVID, but I actually have a job in another country that I’ll be returning to once the pandemic ends. I haven’t been around my sister too much in the past year, but I did try to call her a few times a week before I moved back. 

Finally, to the people calling my sister stupid — she is not. Please have a little empathy, the idea that your husband might be cheating can be hard to face.

This is a wild situation. To give some background, I (32F) have a sister “Leah” (26F). She’s been married to “Jake” for five years, and they have two kids. We all grew up very Christian, I ended up leaving the church, but my sis and BIL are still on fire Christians.

Anyway, Leah has mentioned things to me that seem very sketchy. I think Jake is cheating, but she won’t accept the thought. He leaves their bed at night and doesn’t come back til after work the next day, he hides money, and he’s trying not to conceive another kid with my sister. I’ve gently tried to give her a reality check, but it hasn’t worked.

Well, on Friday after work they 
came over to swim (totally fine in our state). Jake was swimming with the kids, and my sister and I were sitting in the grass keeping an extra eye on them. Jake had lots of red scratches on his back, to me they looked like fingernails. I made a joke to my sister about their dry spell being over, and she said they still hadn’t had sex in a year. 

I gently told her that they looked like finger marks, and that it was sketchy as hell. She said casually that Jake had gone on a “prayer walk” with his men’s group and had been spiritually attacked by a demon. Now, we grew up with these kinds of beliefs, but I told her that was crazy and just an excuse. 

She got really flustered and pulled her kids out of the pool. She told Jake she had a headache, and they left.

We have known her for 2 years. She mixes our names up all the time. At least 3 times a day. We know she’s doing it on purpose to annoy us. 

So. Yesterday I was in living room and she called me my twin’s name. I just ignored her and pretended she wasn’t there. Then she called me my name and I answered her normally.

I was taking a nap in the grass after I was done swimming and listening to music.  I didn't even know my sister had her BF over cause I was in the back yard for basically the whole afternoon (12-4).  

My sister woke me up and called me an AH, for wearing something so ""skimpy"" around her BF.  I asked her what she meant and I guess her BF kept looking out the window while I was napping/swimming (I know weird).  I told her that if he was looking at me that is his problem and that I wasn't trying to cause anything.  She was PISSED at me, like I haven't seen her this mad at me since we were kids and had to share a room.  She full on told me ""not to dress like a whore when her BF is over"".

AITA for telling my dad I hate my step siblings after they knocked over my dead mom’s urn?,21912,Not the A-hole,1805,f6xtoi,1582254075.0,"Backstory:My mom died when I was like 4 and my dad remarried when I was 6. My step mom is alright and I don't have any problems with her. She had 3 kids from a previous marriage, an 18yo girl 17yo boy and 15yo girl, I am 18 so I'm the same age as the oldest, but I'm older by a couple months. At first when we all moved it I was happy to have siblings, but the feeling wasn't mutual at all and they excluded me a lot from things. Saying that I'm ""not one of them"" and other crap like that. Me and the 17yo fought A LOT like almost daily, nothing too bad just dumb kid stuff. Our parents nipped that in the bud but arguments with him were daily till i was like 13 and just gave up. The 18yo HATES me, cause of me and her brother fighting a lot and same with the 15yo. My dad and step mom tried to make us all one blended family but it just didn't work, I was open to it but they were intent on just blocking me out. Around 12 I just stopped trying and did my own thing, I have absolutely 0 relationship or attachment with any of them.  

Main problem:  I was away at a friends house and I forgot to lock the door to my room.  My step siblings have had a problem with going into my room cause I keep my stuff organized and I’m the only one with a tv in my room (I paid for it). And they watch tv, I usually just let them to avoid talking to them.   I have a mini memorial of my mom in my room that has a plaque of my mom and her urn.  It’s not much but I like it, I guess all 3 were watching tv and somehow my urn got knocked over.........a lot of the ash is now in my carpet and now it’s basically just an empty thing.  When I got home I flipped my shit, it got bad enough that my dad came into my room and sent them out.  When I told him what happened he said that he’s sorry and that he will talk to him.  (This is where I may be the AH) my dad said something about never being too mad at “family”.  I had enough and told him exactly this “they aren’t my family, they have made home life shit for years and now knocked over the ashes of my mom.  I fucking HATE them.”  He went quiet and didn’t say anything and just left my room. 

My step siblings haven’t apologized (not that I’d accept anything they say). I feel bad what I said to my dad but I don’t regret a word of what I said.  AITA?

Edit: thanks for the awards!!! 

Edit 2: when I was 7 I did something really stupid and put the plastic bag out and poured the ashes straight into the urn.  I regretted once I did it but I was a dumb 7yo.  And the urn has a chip in the ring so it never screwed on right and was wobbly",False,1582296639.0,2020-02-20 19:01:15
AITA for yelling at my wife for being unhelpful while I took our son to the ER for a broken arm?,21902,Not the A-hole,898,eyivk2,1580812531.0,"My wife (33F) is a SAHM with our son (4M) and we also have a daughter (6F) in school. Last Friday I get a frantic call from my wife around noon that our son fell off the top bunk while she wasn’t looking and now his arm looks really really swollen.

So I find him crying and holding an incredibly swollen, red arm sitting on the ground and refuses to let anyone touch it. My wife is sitting on the couch crying and saying how his arm looks so bad. I pick him up to go to the emergency room. I try to dress him since he can’t open his arms and ask her to get the car seat ready. She doesn’t move and keeps crying. I give up and do the best I can and call for my wife to get in...she just sobs and shakes her head saying “I can’t I can’t.” So I drive off without her.

I got really annoyed at my wife at this point. We get to the hospital and they want to run him through some X-rays and he’s screaming bloody murder. Around 3pm I get a call from my daughter’s school saying that no one’s picked her up (my wife’s job) so I call my wife. No one picks up. I call 3-4 more times before I rush out to the school. My son was inconsolable at me leaving him. Even the doctors were confused why I had to leave so soon. 

I get home with my daughter and rush in to find my wife STILL CRYING on the phone to her sister. I absolutely let loose and yelled “where the FUCK were you??? Why didn’t you answer my calls?” She’s shocked and just screams at me back that she’s overwhelmed and can’t handle all this right now. I get our daughter out and tell my wife to look after her. My daughter is crying because mom’s crying and hangs on to my legs wanting to go with me. My wife makes no move to help me so I just ended up bringing our daughter with me to the hospital.

The next day while our kids were both sleeping I couldn’t hold back and yelled at my wife for being absolutely zero help. She got equally mad and told me I humiliated her in front of her sister (when I yelled when she was on the phone) and that I should’ve been more considerate of the fact that she is really bad in emergencies. While I know she’s not great in emergencies, this was something else and I felt like I didn’t have a partner at all. 

Now she wants an emergency couples counseling session to “address my rage” but I am honestly conflicted. I’ve never yelled at her before and I do feel guilty but I also feel like these circumstances were extreme. However I did apologize for yelling and wonder if I made things worse.

AITA for requesting prayer breaks at work because my religious coworkers do even though I’m not religious?,21891,Not the A-hole,5251,cnsiur,1565329310.0,"I’m an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. 

I have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. I would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. 

They get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don’t need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  

I used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work I do. She couldn’t give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. 

Even though I’m a known atheist I decided I too wanted some time to meditate everyday. I told my manager I needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. She initially said no, and then I got a hastily written email saying of course I was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. She’d obviously checked with HR and covered her ass. 

For the last six months I’ve been having my 30 mins ‘meditating’ out in our company garden everyday. This has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have ‘meditative time’ and it’s causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. 

I recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that I was being rude and ‘ruining it’ for everyone else and that at Xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them.

We got engaged last March and were supposed to get married next year, but two weeks ago I learned that our entire relationship was a lie. Someone showed me a dashcam recording of her saying that she still loves her ex and she was only with me because I’m the better choice. I confronted her, she admitted it was true, I called off the wedding and broke up with her.

I’m determined to move past this as soon as possible and onto better things, the things that I should have achieved had Mia not wasted five years of my life. But there’s an issue that has me on the fence: I was supposed to donate my kidney to Mia’s brother Tom, and now I don’t know if I should do it.

Tom has ESRD and needs a second kidney transplant as soon as possible because the kidney from his first transplant is failing. I’m not that close to him and I was only going to do it because I wanted to help Mia’s family in any way I could because I though they were going to be m family. But now that I know that she was just playing me the whole time, I’m having second thoughts. Organ donation is a big deal, I will literally risk my life to give part of myself to someone, and at this point I don’t want to do it for the brother of the girl who lied to me, used me and made me a fool for five years.

AITA for telling our family that my sister is a prostitute after she insulted my wife’s disability,21823,Everyone Sucks,1796,gsdebk,1590724319.0,"So my wife is paraplegic, she was when I first met her. It’s from an accident a long time ago, but she’s adapted well to it. I love her and she’s just as “useful” as someone who can walk.

My sister for some reason has never liked my wife. She’s always had some problem with her, whether she claims it’s attitude or something else. I’ve talked to my wife about it and she doesn’t know why, and I’ve talked to my sister about it and she’s never given me a straight answer on why she doesn’t like her. I had just accepted it until now, not everybody likes everyone else, and until now my sister hadn’t said anything rude about it.

Now my sister was a prostitute in college, and she claims she’s just “camming” now. She doesn’t have a job, she just does that. She told me because I found out accidentally once. She made me hide it to our family and claims she has a job at a company near us.

I was talking to my sister on the phone last week because she wanted me to fix her sink or at least look at it, because her landlord wasn’t doing anything about it. I had told her I didn’t know when I could because I’ve been remodeling one of our bathrooms, which has turned into a larger project than I really bargained for(I might end up just hiring someone to do it honestly).

My sister then, for no reason, made a comment about my wife, she said “why don’t you just have her(my wife, who I had said something to) make herself useful and help, or wait, she can’t because of her *disability* (she said this mockingly, as if being in a wheelchair isn’t a disability)”. I had the phone on speakerphone and my wife heard. She was pretty hurt by it, and I was beyond pissed off. I yelled at her and hung up.

After consoling my wife a little bit, I decided to call our parents and tell them what my sister actually does for her job. They thanked me for telling them, and that was that. Then my sister called me again and yelled at me, saying our whole family is calling her telling her to stop, and staging an intervention for her. I told her that she should have thought about that before being a bitch to my wife and hung up.

It’s been a few days and now I’m thinking I went a little nuclear on her. At the time I felt like yelling at her wasn’t enough, but now I think maybe yelling would have been enough. AITA?

They have a maid who comes and tidies up for a bit every day. 

My family isn’t broke, but we’ve never had people working for us, and it made me super uncomfortable. Like, who am I to have someone serving me and cleaning around me while I sit there? I can’t imagine if my mom were witnessing that. She’d flip. 

So I got up and started to help her tidy up. She thanked me for the help and told me I really didn’t have to worry about it, but I told her it was no trouble (it really wasn’t, we were just sitting watching TV.) 

Later that night my girlfriend’s parents asked me not to help the maid clean because it was a boundary thing and her work was her work and guests are guests. I told them it made me really uncomfortable to have someone clean around me and they just said not to worry because she’s paid well and has been with them a long time. 

The next day it happened again and it made me so uncomfortable I said “hey let’s go outside” to my girlfriend but she was busy on her laptop. So eventually I couldn’t help it, I had to jump up and help her out. 

Her parents walked in and looked pissed and my girlfriend finally clued in and ushered me outside. 

I’m still so confused by the situation. I’m not sure if I was in the wrong for helping her clean or if I’m in the wrong now for not helping her.

AITA for taking my birth control in public?,21779,Not the A-hole,3182,eno5q8,1578868618.0,"I’ve been taking oral contraceptives for about 6 years now. When I first started, I was worried about what other people would think (I was raised in a pretty “sex-is-taboo” household) and hid that I was taking them very well. Now, however, I’m in my mid twenties and I’m comfortable enough in my skin that I don’t really mind if people know I’m on the pill. 

Anyway, I was out on a double date with a couple we know last night and the alarm on my watch started going off (vibration). It was time for me to take my pill. While we’re all chatting, I reach down into my purse that’s beside me in the booth and get my pill, put it in my mouth, and take a drink of water. Whole thing probably took 30 seconds. 

My friend didn’t comment, but her boyfriend made a face and said “did you just take something?”

I said “yeah, my birth control.”

He made another face and said, “that’s inappropriate don’t you think?”

I just kind of exchanged a look with my boyfriend who seemed as lost as I was. I mumbled an “uh, ok” cause I hate confrontation. 

He went on, “you should probably go to the bathroom to do that. It’s really not polite to take that kind of pill in front of a group of people. We get it, you have sex.”

I really had no idea what to say, so my boyfriend changed the subject to the game that was on over our heads at the bar and the night carried on. 

I was pretty much floored. Wtf? I had been doing this for a while now, any time I’m out and my alarm goes off, I’ll just take my pill and go about my day. Wouldn’t it be like taking any other medication? Or Advil? I don’t really see the problem. AITA?",True,False,2020-01-12 14:36:58
AITA for (rudely) refusing to give my kid's hand-me-downs and old toys & furniture to my sister?,21753,Not the A-hole,2347,cpbrj0,1565642036.0,"I found out I was pregnant with my daughter at 19 years old, had her at 20. When I told my parents they said they'ld be happy for me but they didn't want to pay for anything, have us live with them or babysit all the time, basically wanting to treat me they same they would if I had kids older and not as a teenager still going to university. I was already living independently, both my boyfriend and I worked and we live in a country with free/cheap education and healthcare. In our culture families are close and grandparents are very involved in their grandchildren's lives, so I thought they'd still be emotionally supportive.

During my pregnancy I asked my parents and/or sister for help a few times: driving me to the hospital when I started contracting 3 months early, picking me up for a family event when I wasn't allowed to drive, helping me prepare meals to put in the freezer, and staying with them for a weekend when I was due any day and my boyfriend couldn't be home. They refused, telling me that I was expecting to be catered to. They also didn't want to come with me to ultrasounds or basically hear me talking about anything baby related, telling me that I was trying to win them over and have them ""forget that I was making dumb decisions"". When I spoke to other relatives my sister ""joked"" that I was trying to get gifts from them. I had severe post-partum depression and thought I was an entitled jerk and a failure, unworthy of the baby or anybody's support but impoved a lot after months of therapy. My relationship with my parents started improving after they apologised for not getting me to the hospital. They told me they were afraid I was going to destroy my life and thought that they were showing tough love. Impovement in our case meant that we we're on speaking terms and they're allowed in their granddaughter's life, we're not close.

Which brings us to today, 3 years later. My sister (29yo) is pregnant and she's getting a completely different treatment than I did when I was treated ""as an independent adult"". Our parents stay with her when her husband isn't home, don't let her do any housework, paid for her birthing class and a maternity photoshoot and get her whatever she craves to eat. Yesterday my mother called and asked me to bring over to her house all of my daughter's old furniture, toys and anything else of her baby stuff I have kept because she wants to set up a nursery so my sister's baby will have everything they need when she babysits. Apparently my sister wanted my parents to buy some new stuff to keep at their house but my mother told her mine will do. I answered that mine will not do, my sister should try to get freebies from other relatives instead, and ended the call. I've been getting texts from my parents and sister telling me to come to my senses and calling me petty, immature and resentful among other things.

My boyfriend and I have some bdsm stuff in the bedroom that we didn’t put away because we were lazy and didn’t think anyone would see, since no one was coming over. Not anything super insane, just a pair of handcuffs and a rope. 

Anyway, when I got home my friend was just in my house, sitting in the dining room. No warning, she didn’t tell me, I was completely blindsided. I asked her why she was in my house and she said she had lost a necklace the last time she was here, and waited until I was gone as to “socially distance”.

UPDATE: AITA for not sending my dog to boarding while my bf’s mother visits?,21654,UPDATE,1226,h05hah,1591800412.0,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gixeyq/aita_for_not_sending_my_dog_to_boarding_while_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

After a week of angry silence, waiting for each other to bring this up, I bypassed my bf and went to his mom. 

I reached out, talked about her feelings for Tank. It started out pleasant. Then I told her that bf said she wanted my dog boarded, I asked why she didn’t feel comfortable with Tank.

Direct quote: “You don’t know what his past is, he’s big and unpredictable and I don’t want to be staying with that. It would be different if you knew, but you don’t. I just don’t feel comfortable sharing a space with a dog that may attack me for going pee in the middle of the night or grabbing a cup of water!”

I was angry and didn’t want to scream and make her upset, so I very politely said “If you don’t feel comfortable living with Tank for two weeks, even though your own son has been since August, you can stay in a hotel when you visit.” And I hung up on her. 

Bf got home a few hours later and was angry because I talked to her, made her upset and hung up on her. Now she thinks I hate her. He said I wasn’t being fair to her. 

I asked why he wanted me to board Tank so badly. Bf knows he wouldn’t attack her or do anything aggressive towards her. 

And all he had to say was boiled down to “Can’t you just do it to make this whole thing easier? He’s a dog.”

We argued. At some point, in circles. How Tank is a dog. He doesn’t get rights in the apartment. And things got worse when I asked what would happen in the future if we were still together and she decided to visit when we were living in a house. (Irk, kinda unbelievable, millennials owning a home? Laughable.) He said that would be different because we could “put him in another room, or something.” 

So... my dog has to be penalized for living in our home with us when your mom visits? 

I said it on my last post and I’ll say it again: When I adopted Tank, I took on the responsibility of taking care of him, making him my first priority, treating him with respect as he is a living creature. I see him as I would a child, I do the same things for him as someone does for a child. He is family, four paws or not. 

I made a clear choice that night. While his mother may still be visiting whenever it is safe to do so, it won’t be in this apartment. 

We came a truth: This and other things we talked about are big and can’t be ignored. We realized we don’t want the same things. And that’s not something you can compromise on. 

So this all started with my- what I thought would eventually be- my future mother in law wanting me to board my dog, and ended up with me and bf mutually breaking up after 4 years of dating.

We understand in the long run, it wouldn’t have worked out.

Initially, they moved out of state after their wedding for my son’s work. Then things went downhill. My DIL got pregnant and quit her job to be a SAHM. Shortly after the baby was born, however, my son lost his job as well. Their savings drained quickly and it was too expensive to live in their state. My wife and I said they could live with us while they got back on their feet, on the condition that both got jobs. This was 2 years ago and they’ve lived with us ever since. Both work and while they don’t pay rent, they cover all their own expenses, along with the baby’s.

Recently, however, they told us that they were planning on having a second child. My wife and I said if they wanted a second child, they had to move out. We love our grandchild but we don’t want another baby in the house. And to me, if they can afford another child, they can afford to move out. They said we can’t tell them whether or not they can have another baby. I said if they’re living in our house, I absolutely can. 

My wife and I still have two other kids living at home. My other son is a single parent as well and has a child (4) who lives here full time. He has no plans of having more kids and is close to moving out (would’ve sooner but with the shutdowns it messes up his search). We can’t have another kid around here.

AITA for recommending the worst tattoo artist I know to a girl that was trying to copy my tattoo?,21623,Everyone Sucks,1645,ebo6w2,1576572619.0,"This will be on a throwaway so it’s not attached to my main account. 

I have a lot of tattoos. My most recent tattoo is a tattoo that I designed with my husband. We got matching ones for our anniversary. It is super personal. 

As I was showing it off to my friends, I notice one girl in our group (who I’m not super close to) was really into it. She even took a picture of it which I thought was strange but I let it slide. 
Let’s call this girl Sarah. 

Sarah does not  have any tattoos that I know of, if she does they are really small and in unnoticed places. So a week or so later I hear through the grape vine that Sarah is trying to get a copy of my tattoo. honestly I suspected this. She told a couple of friends of mine the design, and for some reason, didn’t think that they would tell me. But here comes the crazy part, she comes to me and asks me for a recommendation for an artist. She specifically wanted one that wasn’t too expensive.

I asked her what she was going to get. She was really coy with me and told me that she had not finished thinking about it yet. So I recommend the worst tattoo “artist” I know, let’s call him Bubba. I’ve gotten two “joke” tattoos from Bubba, one is terrible and blown out ,but it’s okay because it’s that duck or rabbit optical illusion. The other one I have had covered up. He works at subway during the day and gives tattoos from his garage. 

I knew she wouldn’t do her proper research and check him out, and she didn’t. She went and got her cheap tattoo from Bubba, and it is *fucked. up* It’s already blown out, the lines aren’t straight,  and may be infected.  My husband and I are howling about this, but a few friends of mine think what I did was really messed up. She’ll be ok, she’ll just have a really really shitty version of my tattoo.

AITA for wanting a sunrise wedding?,21608,Everyone Sucks,3326,dnh2km,1572140316.0,"Every year on our anniversary, my fiance and I wake up early to go to the beach and watch the sunrise together. It's a very special tradition, as we have both overcome a number of personal challenges during our time together, and the symbolism of watching a new day begin is deeply meaningful for us. 

We decided we wanted to incorporate this into our wedding. Our plan is to have our ceremony on the beach the and have everyone walk over to a beachfront restaurant for breakfast, bloody Marys and mimosas (we've already talked to the restaurant owner about this, who loves the idea and said he'd be happy to open early for us). After that, everyone is free for the remainder of the day. Our friends and family are mostly local and should all be able to travel to the beach in under an hour, except for some extended family flying in from Canada, but that's unavoidable.

Based on our geographic location and the date of the wedding next summer, we've scheduled the ceremony start time for 5:30 a.m., when there should be plenty of light but the sun itself won't be quite visible yet.

We've been getting a LOT of backlash from our families about this, who say this is way too early and we need to move the ceremony to a more ""normal"" time of day. But my fiance and I don't feel like we're asking for anything that unreasonable. AITA?",True,False,2019-10-26 18:38:36
AITA for not changing my tattoo based on my childs pronouns?,21581,Not the A-hole,2391,dbhs1d,1569904302.0,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Basically I [M42] got tattoos of the names of all 3 of my children. I got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) ""Andy, Sara, Kate"". I had these tattoos all done at once after Kate was born knowing she would be my last. My oldest child Andy[T22] came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now. My wife[F41] immediately supported her and made sure that I would too without any arguement or else she would divorce me. It was a huge family issue for a while but eventually it was solved and everything has been good for the last little while. I'm slowly learning more and trying to accept my daughter and her new pronouns and her name change to Athena. 

The problem arose yesterday when my wife and Athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. The tattoo going down my arm still reads ""Andy"" and not ""Athena"" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. My wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but I explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""Andy"" to ""Athena"". I told her I would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which I can not afford either of. I explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that I don't understand why this needs to be brought up now. Athena yelled at me and called me a shitty father and said if I don't support who she is, I just need to leave her life. My wife threatened to go stay with her parents with the kids if I don't ""get my act together"". I personally don't see the reason to change the tattoo and this feels like a bigger problem then it should be.

She found out she was pregnant a month back and he has completely disappeared into thin air. He has blocked or deleted her from tinder and she never got his real name (they both went by aliases) and now she is desperately searching for him on Facebook but nothing even in the ballpark has come up. 

The guy offered her abortion money and offered to go with her. She refused because she has a 3 y/o and she wants a sibling for her baby. 

I can’t say I didn’t see him disappearing. He’s a piece of shit coward for having an affair in the first place and so of course he’s gonna abscond from a pregnancy from his side chick too. From my perspective it’s fairly obvious he was using my girlfriends friend and she should have either known that or have been prepared to deal with the consequences. 

My girlfriend is very worried about her friend and keeps talking to me about it and asking what I think even though I’ve made it clear I don’t approve of either of their trashy behavior. I told her ‘well what did she expect?’ She keeps asking me if I think ‘as a man’ is it possible he will come back. I said hell no.

"AITA for child locking my aunt, and then leaving her at a gas station?",21525,Not the A-hole,1546,gpr17s,1590361146.0,"My (16f) aunt (33f) lives with my family. She has me drive her around, and refuses to sit in the front passenger seat because she wants to act like it’s a taxi/chauffeur situation, which is shitty of her, but I haven’t said anything.

The other day we were driving through a restaurant drive through, and it was packed. The parking lot was full. My aunt got out of the car while we were in the drive through, and I asked what the fuck she was doing. She told me she was “getting claustrophobic”, and I told her to stay in the car so she doesn’t get hit by another car. (My reasoning for saying this is she wanted to walk close to the actual road to smoke, where traffic’s busy. y’know; normal road.)

She ignored me and got out anyway, so when I pulled up to the drive through window, I got out and put child lock on the back doors. I did this because my aunt has done this several times before, has almost gotten hit when she does it, and once had her foot run over by a car because she does it. (Which, btw, she blamed on me even though another car ran over her foot...)

I got our food, my aunt gets back in, we get on the main road, it’s a traffic jam. My aunt tries getting out of the car again, and finds that she’s child locked. She starts screaming and cussing at me, calling me a little mother fucker and screaming at me to let her out. So when we could pull over again, I pulled over, let her out, and told her she could call someone else for a ride home. (I left her at a gas station)

I got home and my parents asked where my aunt was. I explained what happened, my mom told me I was in the right, and my dad flipped his shit. He told me to go out and pick her back up, and I told him to pick her up himself, because I’m done driving her around because she acts like a toddler. He decided it was appropriate to call me a spoiled bitch before leaving to pick her up.

AITA for child locking my aunt, and then leaving her at a gas station?

Info: The “traffic jam” I mentioned: One lane stopped, while the one right next to it kept moving. People were actively moving and getting into the lane that wasn’t stopped. 

Also: no, my aunt doesn’t have a mental disability. She’s just been spoiled by her parents and my dad. And yes, she is my dad’s sister.

Also also: My dad made a deal with me to get the car. I saved up $2,000 as a “down payment” for the car, and he’d make monthly payments of $200 to the guy we bought the car from. Or so he tells me. At this point in time, I have paid more for the car than he has, as I’ve only had it for four months. And yes, I work (or rather worked... I got laid off back when everything shut down)

Second edit for info: I didn’t leave her stranded. She had her phone, and if she chose not to call someone, that’s on her.

Also: You know how some people go really fast in a residential neighborhood? Apply that to the restaurant’s parking lot. People get really mad/fast in chick-fil-a parking lots for some reason.

Also also (again): I’m in America. We get our licenses at 16, and I’m almost 17.

And yes, I pay for my own gas to drive dear auntie around. My dad, the one who called me a spoiled bitch, raised me not to expect anything to just be handed to me. If I were out of gas on a back road, he would leave me there and tell me to figure it out. (This is from experience.)",False,1590345394.0,2020-05-24 15:59:06
AITA for not wanting to lie about having a baby with a lesbian?,21523,Not the A-hole,1622,gak45b,1588230915.0,"I (30m) had a son with my ex when we were teenagers (we were 15 and 16) my son is about to turn 15 in May. We did not intend on having a child that young, but we decided to make it work. It was a wonderful decision & I love my son so much. Our relationship did not last, as my ex realized she was gay a couple years after our son was born. We ended on good terms, and currently split custody of my son. My son stays with me and my girlfriend (29f) during the week, and his mother and her wife on the weekends. 

   My girlfriend and I just moved in together recently, and I have just began to get close with her family recently as well. My girlfriend and son get along very well, but my girlfriend wants me to lie about the situation I have with my son. 

For context, my girlfriend's family is very religious (jehovah's witness) and while she is not as religious as they are, she fears they will judge me or ""not like me"" when they find out that I had a child with a lesbian who is very involved in my son's life.  She also told me they would be uncomfortable with the fact that I had a child outside of wedlock. 

   My girlfriend's suggestion was to lie, and tell her parents (if it ever came up) that I was previously married to my son's mother, and that she left me, or PASSED AWAY, and to absolutely not mention the lesbian part. I don't feel comfortable lying about my son for several reasons: 

\- I love this woman, and I want any love her family has for me to be based on authenticity. 

\- I do not want to set the precedent for my son that lying is acceptable to make people like you.

\-I do not believe it is wrong to be gay, and I won't tip-toe around it in order to spare feelings. 

\- My son is a valid & legitimate person whose story matters, and I won't erase that because it is a little different than most people.

My girlfriend is really upset with me, and says that it isn't a big deal, and that my son doesn't even need to know. She is hesitant to let me spend time with her parents now & after this stay-at-home order is over.

AITA for not sharing medical history before being pranked?,21489,Not the A-hole,2100,gflupe,1588938741.0,"Heyo,
I'm a schizophrenic.  Started when I was 22, and will last till I die. I'm active in schizophrenic communities, go to groups,  the works but I am fairly private about it to most people to include friends. It's fairly common for people to think I'm eccentric (comes with the turf) due to some of my habits. Those habits include not going to parties or other places with lots of people, suddenly deciding not to do something (I have to be protective not to do or go to certain things if I think a delusion might be coming on), saying the occasional odd quip, normal schizophrenic stuff.

Some friends thought it would be funny to make it seem like  I might be going crazy as a group. They would individually wear something silly like a wizard hat or dinosaur costume (TRex blow up costume) to a group event or say something totally out of the ordinary and pretend like it was normal (Police like to track people like you, covid is just a way to microchip you, etc). These are very real scary thoughts to me. I would ask members of the group if they had heard concerns about these conspiracies or weird garb from the other members, but they all acted like they had hung out with that particular member that day and I hadn't been involved.

I was really, really scared that this could have been a massive delusion morphing into a full psychosis so I preemptively checked myself into a hospital to stop myself from potentially hurting myself or diving further into the rabbit hole(common in schizophrenic community). I was so scared my medications stopped working. No one heard from me for a few days while I was in the hospital, and when I checked out I confided in one of them about what had happened. I got a really long apology explaining what had happened and I blew up at them. 

I have ignored attempts from the others trying to apologize and have no desire to talk with them again.

AITA for not previously stating that I am schizophrenic?

Edit- People have been asking saying to post the length of the prank. Around 3 weeks.

Edit 2- Thank you for the awards and stuff, but I really want to highlight some of the messages I have gotten. I'm at around 150 messages and counting and am trying to respond to the ones where I can hopefully offer insight.

Resources that I find helpful- r/schizophrenia 

For groups just google schizophrenia support groups in my area, something will pop up and when you actually get there someone will have a further list. 

You get what you put into groups. You don't have to talk your first couple of times. But no one will look at you with the batshit look if you say ""Reality check- is there a bird in the room or something in that regard"". That did happen once and the audible sigh of relief from 8 other people and the laughter that followed was hysterical. 

Medication helps so much. It's the difference between being able to go for a walk with my dog and staying in bed all day. But it takes time. So many people have asked what drug and dosage a loved on should go on. I cannot answer that. There are so many drugs out there and different dosages. I can tell you that you (probably) will not have a noticable difference in behavior in two weeks after trying a medication. You start small, and work your way up to a therapeutic effect (when it actually helps). It might take some time to actually get to feeling human again.

He is a good kid, good grades, respectful, does his chores, etc. Last Summer my son said that he wanted a new computer. To his credit, he got a part-time job and saved up for it, and built a pretty nice gaming PC. We are really proud of him, as he saved for it nearly all summer.

My sister and her husband have recently moved in with us. They have a 9-year-old son. My sister has a history of IDK how to put it, being entitled. She thinks her kid can do no wrong and spoils her kid.

Well when they came over, my nephew noticed my son's PC. He asked if he can play on it, my son said not now. That was the end of it for a couple of days. Again, my nephew wanted to play on it. I asked my son if he minded sharing, he said he would rather not since its expensive and doesn't want it to break. This has caused a big argument. My sister says its extremely unfair to my nephew because he doesn't have a system to play on, just his iPad, so my son should have to share. I told her it's his PC not mine, he paid for it so it's up to him. She then accused me of being a 'spineless parent'. I said I'm not, but I'm not going to force my son to share his own computer. My nephew ended up having a huge fit, which she then blamed me for his fit, but gave him 3 more hours of iPad time to quiet him down.

Its been 4 days and my sister hasn't brought it up directly again, just being passive-aggressive. While on one hand, I don't want to make my kid share, because it's his computer, he saved up for it and I don't feel it would be the right thing to do, to force my kid to share.

I’ve been out since I was 18 and I’ve never hidden it, but I don’t like actively mention it or broadcast it cos it’s literally nobody’s business. The first person I came out to was my dad (40) and he has always been supportive of me. He was 16 when I was born and practically raised me as a single dad so we have an exceptionally close relationship. Anyway onto the story.

My dad recently turned 40, only earlier this month. He had a huge party and drank a bit too much and was severely hungover the following morning. He’s a freelance photographer and had accepted a contract with a local business and was meant to hand in some photography work he’d done to them the morning after his birthday. He was too hungover to do so, so he asked if I’d do it, he called their office to tell them he was sending his son with the work and I went in.

Everything was fine and I ended up meeting a bunch of people he’s currently working with. They knew I was my dad’s son as he talks about me with them. I got some conversation with them to be nice and a few of the younger women started I guess flirting with me? A few of them called me attractive and stuff like that and I kinda just stood there awkwardly. It was just wild that straight women were hitting on me. I didn’t encourage it or anything but I didn’t say anything as I was too embarrassed and I eventually said I had to run and off I went.

My dad went in the day after and he was questioned about if I was single. He said no, I wasn’t and that I had a boyfriend and that was all he said. Well, turns out these women then started blatantly calling me for an AH as I apparently let them embarrass themselves by openly hitting on me when there was no chance I’d ever be interested. My dad did fight my corner and said that I was literally there to just drop off his work and that I had no obligation to disclose I was gay.

I’m thankful my dad’s on my side but these women calling me an AH kinda makes me feel bad for not saying anything.

I am getting married in a few months. We have a few atheist friends who have a general dislike for religion so I thought it would be for the best to only invite them to the party. My future wife and both of our families are Roman Catholic. Catholic ceremonies are *long*. I'm talking 1 hour of pure mass and additional half an hour of the actual ""getting married"" part. If you are not a believer, it is boring af. Hell, Im Catholic and I know I'll be bored for 80% of it. I thought I'll spare them the trouble.

Anyway, one of my friends brought it up, saying I forgot to put the time and the church where the ceremony will take place on the invitation. So I said that she doesnt have to come to the religious part and just come for the wild party part. She got confused, I explained and she got annoyed to say the least. Said she isnt heartless and would sit through the 2/3 to see me get married in the 1/3. I tried to explain again & fix things but I felt guilty the whole time.

Edit: ah, I suppose I am TA. Just for clarification though: 
- we did explain things and they are coming to church. No hard feelings between us. 

- those who I decided to ""spare"" expressed anti-religious-events stances in the past (not going to Christenings, First Communions & Confirmations) so I thought it translated to wedding ceremonies

AITA for telling my mom she's the reason I don't want any kids?,21458,Not the A-hole,2729,dshdji,1573080858.0,"I (23F) am the oldest of 4 siblings. My dad passed away when I was 14, leaving us and my mom. 

There's a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings. So when my dad passed my mom looked at me for babysitting duties. Walking them to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that. If I had to guess I'd say I spend 4 hours a day minimum taking care of them, most days more. Plus an hour or so on chores. 

Now I love my siblings, and I love my mom. But from when I was 14 till I moved out at 19 I had no social life, no hobbies, barely any friends. All there was was taking care of them, chores, school, and from 16 to later work too. 

I'm on good terms with my mom, we meet for coffee about twice a month to catch up. I've been in a steady relationship for over 2.5 years, so whenever we meet my mom brings up marriage and kids. I've politely told her I don't want any of that yet, possibly ever, so she can stop asking. 

When she kept pushing (spread out over several visits after I told her to stop asking) i told her ""Giving up my youth to take care of someone else's kids because they couldn't ruined the idea of having kids myself for me."" I didn't mean to be rude, but it's true. 

She cried. I told her I don't blame her, but that it still wasn't a good position to be put in as a teen. I didn't apologise. 

AITA?

Edit: When I said ""taking care of someone else's kids because they couldn't"" I wasn't trying to be malicious. 
A) She at that moment in time, genuinely couldn't, which is why I had to. 
B) I called them 'someone else's kids' because they don't feel like siblings anymore, I had to carry way too much responsibility to just feel like a big sister. 

I wasn't trying to be mean about it, but that's why I said it that way.

Edit 2: Yes, I'm aware my mom struggled too, lost her partner, had to work. I was there. I never said I don't sympathise or that it was easy for her. I'm sympathetic to my mom's situation, but that doesn't change the fact that my teenage years where very tough, and I don't want kids because of that.

Edit 3: For the people PMing and commenting about how it's my fault I didn't have friends and not my mom's: I wasn't allowed to bring friends home, my mom was scared it would distract me from watching my siblings.

Last edit: For everyone asking, my mom worked 9-6:30.

AITA for not accommodating a vegan guest?,21426,Asshole,6203,dmlcx3,1571974103.0,"Longtime lurker here. Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.

So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we’ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it’s become a great tradition in our social circle. 

Our friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now.

During our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn’t push the issue. 

However, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. 

My wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don’t agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don’t have anything against her dietary choices, but I don’t believe it’s fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners.

He calls me like an hour later and says his guy started cutting the front rotors and it wasn't gonna work so they needed to replace all 4 four 850. I asked if they cut the backs ones yet and he said no. I specially said *do not* cut the backs ones ""do as little as possible"". 

He calls me again and says his guy cut a back rotor and it wasn't gonna work so I needed to replace those too as it was too uneven now. I said I told you not to cut those and he was like ""I was just tryna to help you out""


I'm fuming at this point, go to pick up my car. It's 750 for the two front rotors and the oil change (when they had quoted me 850 for all 4 and the oil change?!). I pay and leave. My car is literally not drivable  it's so shaky. I bring it back and tell him the car is dangerous at this point and it needs to be fixed. We get into and he's like I'll do the back rotors for free labor but it's 200 for the rotors. I tell him I'll get a lawyer cause I'm not giving him literally another penny, I paid 750 for a car that's worse than before. 


I ask for the manager and eventually they agree that it was their fuck up and they'll eat the back rotors. Pick the car up the next day and it's good. 


I told my parents and they said they're proud of me but my one friend said I was a ""karen""

AITA if I tell my daughter Grandma is ashamed of her race,21369,Everyone Sucks,1578,g6l1l5,1587670413.0,"Here because I genuinely don't know where else to turn.

When I was 21 I had a one night stand that resulted in my wonderful daughter. Her father ghosted me the day after we hooked up and I decided to raise her as a single mum the day I found out I was pregnant.

Throughout my pregnancy, my best friend (we'll name him Sean) became my absolute rock. We grew closer as a result of it and was even there when I delivered my daughter. We came a couple 6 months into my pregnancy and he officially adopted my daughter 3 years after she was born.

We've been together for 7 years, married for 1, and have recently found out we're expecting our first baby. However, this has caused some tension from his family. His family are black and while most of them have been great, his mother (my MIL) did not support our relationship, especially his choice to adopt our daughter. She refuses to acknowledge my daughter and corrects her every time she calls her grandma.

Since finding out we're pregnant, she has been going around telling everyone she is expecting her first grandchild and how we're going to be a real family. My husband just ignores her because 'this is just what she does'.

However, it all came to a head recently when she said she would happily babysit our new baby, but wouldn't want our daughter around. When I asked why, she started saying how embarrassing it is for her and her son to be seen with a white child that clearly isn't theres and that she will never be part of their family.

Since then she's been texting updates regarding her grandbaby. I refuse to speak to her, but my daughter keeps asking why she doesn't get to speak to her grandma. I feel so ashamed to tell her that her grandma doesn't like her because of her race. I just don't see why she can't be fully accepted and part of a family just because she's white.

I want to tell her the truth and go low contact with my MIL but my husband said I would be an asshole if I told my daughter what my MIL has been saying. WIBTA if I told my daughter her grandma is ashamed of her race?

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Wow this blew up. Just thought i'd clarify a few things. My MIL is of Caribbean decent, where nobody 'disrespects' their elders. My husband has told me numerous times how she used to chase him round the house with a hairbrush if he raised his voice at her so I suppose that's why he keeps saying to 'just ignore her'.

I know I probably would be an asshole, but I just don't know what to do. My daughter is such a people pleaser and she makes so much effort to try and get her grandma to like her. She keeps asking what she can do to make Grandma like her more and it just breaks my heart.

Also to that woman who had the nerve to comment about the number of baby daddies I have and how weird it looks having a white and mixed child, screw you!

**Edit 2:** So I showed your responses to my husband and we had a long talk about his family and our daughter. He agreed that the comments and her attitude have been out of order and he has quietly been talking to my FIL to get her to stop. However, everytime his dad brings it up, she either ignores him or completely blows up. 

I put my footdown and said I refuse to subject our daughter to this any longer, especially as her behaviour is getting worse and she's already favouring the baby who isn't even here yet. I told him that this is going to damage our daughter in the long term and if he doesn't do something about it, I will not let her see either of the children. He got a bit huffy at the idea of his father not seeing them, but agreed to speak to her tonight. He's completely on my side, but I think he's a bit scared of the woman?

AITA for singling someone out at a comedy show?,21357,Not the A-hole,1682,d5t1e1,1568812384.0,"I do stand up. I also have a day job, because, you know, survival. 

I mentioned at work that I couldn’t do any shifts after 4:00 on Saturday because I had a show. My coworker overheard and asked for tickets so he could take a girl out without having to spend money. 

I had no problem helping him out and I knew this club wouldn’t care if I slid a couple people in. But I’ve been trying to get more bookings at this place and it’s kind of a level up from the sort of places I usually get to perform at so I told them, you know, “please make a point to laugh.”

I’m up there doing my show and I see them and they’re the only ones in the relatively intimate audience who aren’t laughing. It bugs me a little but I didn’t want to lose my rhythm so just ignored them. Then I see that in this dark room that seats, max, forty people this guy is texting with his phone screen on full brightness. 

So I start telling a joke about a time I gave friends from work tickets to see me and they texted through the whole thing and as I’m doing it I’m slowly approaching their table (and the audience realizes I’m talking about these people at this show) yet he doesn’t notice or look up until I’m literally off the stage, approaching the foot of his table, staring at him. 

It killed, so that was the good part. But when I showed up to work I was expecting an apology from him. Instead HE was expecting an apology from me for (I’m quoting here) “inviting him out just to make him the butt of a joke” “making him look like a fool in front of his girl” and embarrassing him at a popular venue in our reasonably small town. 

He basically summarized it as “you’re supposed to be a professional and if you couldn’t handle me texting you shouldn’t be in show business.”

I think, without question, that he’s the asshole. But he doesn’t believe me and the only people I could tell this story to and ask to confirm I’m not crazy and my real life friends, so, biased. 

Who’s the asshole?

AITA for telling my parents that they shouldn’t have had three kids?,21340,Not the A-hole,1353,fzepe8,1586660709.0,"I’m (23F) the youngest in my family with two older sisters, A (27F) and M (26F). In general, I’ve always felt my sisters were raised differently than me. They’re only a year and ten months apart, so they were only one grade apart in school and much closer than they were with me growing up. They got to do all the same activities together, hung out with the same friend groups, and got to travel together once they were both in college. However, I was just the ‘little sister’ that they didn’t want around growing up. For instance, I was literally kicked out of the house during M’s 16th birthday because I was still in middle school and they thought it’d be weird if I was there at the party (still had to clean up their mess when the party was over!). 

Anyway, my sisters got to do a lot of cool activities that I didn’t get to do when I was growing up. They got to do ice skating, horseback riding lessons, all these cool summer camps, etc. Growing up, all I did was sit at their lessons and wait for them to be over. The only activity I had was tennis for a year and a half before my parents canceled it. When my sisters left for college, my parents kind of checked out and didn’t really care I was still in high school. I was pretty much just doing everything on my own. When they got older, my dad bought A three cars (over the course of 5 years) and my mom bought M a car. When I was old enough to drive, my parents said they didn’t have enough money to buy me a car, so I had to finance my first car. My parents even helped them out with rent during college, car insurance, and any other expense. However, I have been pretty much supporting myself since I was 17. 

Today, my sisters are both married with kids. A has two kids and M has one. My mom looks after all the kids while my sisters are working. Meanwhile, I’m in grad school very far away from my family. Anyway, my mom has been complaining how she can’t handle watching 3 kids under the age of 2 at the same time, and has been bugging me to quit school to come help out watching the kids, which pissed me off because it feels like it’s just me revolving my life around my sisters again. She was also pointing out how A has saved up enough money to buy a house which they don’t see me doing at  her age cause I haven’t been saving as much as her (A was living at home until 3 months ago and didn’t pay for anything).That’s when I pretty much snapped and told her that maybe if they treated me equally as them financially, then perhaps I’d be buying a house at 27 as well. She started going on about how it was difficult raising 3 kids, and I told her that she shouldn’t have 3 kids if she couldn’t handle it and treat all 3 equally. My mom got really upset and hung up the phone and hasn’t really reached out to me since. I do feel kind of bad now though because they did provide me food and shelter growing up.",False,False,2020-04-11 20:05:09

* ""I'm with the milf"" 
* ""To-do list: Eat, poop, suck some titties""

Before people on here give me shit about not being able to take a joke, I just didn't really think this was the funniest ""joke."" I was mad about the gift because as I was opening and before I could read what they said, I unfolded the onesie and showed the rest of the party. Some people gave let out a small chuckle, some people looked around at each other kinda surprised. Anyhow, at the end of the party, I asked the person who gave it to me if I could have the gift receipt to return them. I said I definitely wouldn't put my baby in those clothes.

AITA for not letting my classmate use my artwork for her GoFundMe?,21321,Not the A-hole,2796,g60p4a,1587589313.0,"I’m a senior in HS. In December one of my classmates got into a bad car accident that did a lot of damage. She had several surgeries, and is in need of more for her face. Her insurance won’t cover it, hence the GoFundMe. 

I was never friendly with this girl. She spread nasty rumors about a friend of mine, and I always had a tainted view of her. Outside of that incident I never talked to her, and didn’t know she knew that I existed. 

So my classmates are sending around a GoFundMe and a link to T-shirts for sale and I see that my artwork has been used! 

My artwork has nothing to do with her cause, it was a Picasso style self portrait that was an assignment for class. I posted it to twitter. They were using it on T-shirts and in promotions without my permission.

I got into contact with the girl and her friend who is running everything and asked them to take my artwork off of their GoFundMe. At first they said that they didn’t know it was mine, and would credit me (they cropped my siggy out though...) I told them that I didn’t want it credited and preferred it to be taken down. 

The told me they already had T-shirts, people recognized it for her GoFundMe. I honestly didn’t care. Then they started guilt tripping me about it, and I told them I would go through other means to get it taken down. 

Then the girl posts screenshots of our DMs on her twitter, directing people at me, and telling them how heartless I am. I am getting tons of hate messages, and people telling me to just “let her use my shitty artwork.” I can’t even open up any social media without fear of getting shitty messages from my classmates.

I talked to my mom about it and she thinks I should have just kept quiet about it as it’s hard not to look like an asshole for refusing to let her use the image.

WIBTA for eloping when the wedding is this weekend?,21298,Not the A-hole,2683,e5yzda,1575493766.0,"My girlfriend and I had planned to get married on Saturday. We wrapped up all our planning around Halloween, all that was left was to ring some time this week and make sure everything was running smoothly.

She called the venue and the person she spoke to asked her to confirm some changes she'd apparently made. My girlfriend had no clue what he was talking about, and he reminded her of all the changes that had been put in recently. We had not approved any of these changes. We were able to get some of it put back the way it was but there are some things that we couldn't change back at such short notice.

The venue forwarded us the emails asking for the changes so we could look over them. Our communication was being done via an email account we created solely for wedding stuff, and the email address which asked for the changes is the exact same address, except 2 letters are switched round. The venue is very apologetic for not calling us directly but can only fix so much of it at this stage.

We think we know what happened. The whole time we were planning the wedding we got pushback from both sets of parents, and the stuff they had the biggest issues with have all been changed. I'm willing to bet that all of this was related to at least one of our respective parents. We don't know anyone who would want to fuck with us or the wedding this badly except our parents, who got pissy when we told them they couldn't financially contribute to the wedding because they were trying to trade their money for whatever wedding stuff they wanted.

Right now the stuff that we wanted that is still in this wedding is my suit, the venue and the DJ. My girlfriend has gone to pick up her dress and she's not heard from the shop so we're assuming that hasn't changed. I'm calling round everyone and it looks like the menu has been changed, as has the guest list and the cake. We paid for the wedding we'd planned and it looks like any additional costs from the changes (such as the extra people) were paid for by someone else, but they wouldn't give me any of the card info for legal reasons.

We probably won't be speaking to our parents again after this, unless one of them owns up in which case we'll just stop speaking to that one, but this feels like a joint effort as it's dealt with both sets of parent's complaints.

Before my girlfriend left to get the dress she gave me permission to post this as we are seriously considering eloping. We have the marriage certificate here, the honeymoon is unaltered and exactly what we wanted, and there's a few appointments we could make between now and Saturday at the town hall to get the certificate legally signed/filed.

However, we now have around 200 people attending this wedding in 3 days (our original guest list was about 100 including families and plus ones). People have booked hotels, planes, trains, and are coming from other countries to be here. None of these people have done anything to us and would be getting caught in the crossfire if we were to elope instead.

Would we be the arseholes?

Update: I posted in the group chat I have with all 4 parents that someone has been screwing with the wedding, we've found the email they used and we'd be tracking the IP address to a device and location (this was all absolute bullshit, we don't even know how to find an IP address). As soon as I said we'd be tracking the email they all started pointing fingers and accusing each other. It looks like all 4 of them were in on it together. Still not sure what we're doing about the wedding but all 4 parents are uninvited.

We're thinking that we might elope for the ceremony and then have the reception as planned (it's all the same party/venue and we won't get money back) because of the number of people who are coming from all over the place.

&#x200B;

UPDATE 2: My mother made up the email and her mother helped re-plan the wedding. We knew they'd been meeting for lunch but we didn't realise what they were doing in that time. Caterer and baker can fix the menu and cake, and the clothing is all safe. Venue think they might be able to fix the decorations and the parents have paid for the changes.

The ceremony itself is the same (we were worried it had been changed from a non religious ceremony to a religious one but it hadn't) so we'll probably just go through with the day as it currently stands, with a couple changes.

We've decided that we will meet up before the ceremony with some close friends (no parents) to sign the certificate so we're not doing it surrounded by strangers, then have the ceremony and rings as planned with everyone invited, go to the reception with everyone who has been invited because innocent people have paid out money to be here, and then afterwards we will go for drinks with the people who were at the signing earlier in the day.

The venue offered us security, but we're not going to uninvite the additional people or turn them away, and as for our parents, we're not sure. The options are either invite them and let them deal with their invitees so we don't have to, then cut them out of speeches and just don't acknowledge them all day and after the reception cut contact, or just don't let them come, in which case we will need the security the venue offered because I can't see them just not going.

Venue have also said to pretty much just leave it with them, they'll put what they can back to what we'd planned and they're prepared to offer a partial refund based on what they can't fix (so if they fix 50% of it, they're prepared to refund 25% for the 50% they can't fix)

&#x200B;

**FINAL UPDATE:**

**We had a small private thing where we signed the certificate with our closest friends, then we went to the planned ceremony and had a short service where we exchanged rings, followed by a reception.**

**We told the parents that they were not invited, told the venue they weren't invited, the venue put what was essentially a bouncer at the door, and they still got in. They don't seem to understand what they did wrong as they boasted to their guests that ""they planned this, but we changed it to what you're currently seeing"" and their own guests ended up being the ones to tell them how fucked up that was. They were pretty much shamed by their guests into leaving about an hour after they arrived. Also, half their guests didn't show, it was probably about 60-70% our guests in the end, and we definitely had the majority. Food (including cake) was sorted out but not decor, and venue are refunding us 50%, which was going to be 30%, but then they let the parents in.**

**We only spoke to them once to tell them that because after completely fucking up our wedding plans they then couldn't honour one simple request to not come, they would not be hearing from us, potentially ever again, and if they contacted us that would change to definitely never hearing from us again.**

**We are currently in the cab on our way to get drinks with the same friends who were at the signing earlier and then off on our honeymoon.**",False,1575742085.0,2019-12-04 13:09:26
AITA for terrorising my roommates into cleaning up their crap?,21315,Not the A-hole,731,hasst0,1592434813.0,"So I live with two roommates (28m & 21f) who are less than helpful when it comes to cleaning the house. 

Wet clothes are left in the washer for days on end, food is left rotting in the fridge and in the sink for several weeks if I do not clean it, they also just casually throw garbage into the yard. If asked nicely multiple times for them to clean their mess and even not so nicely a few times. 

I am far from the most hygienic person in the world myself, I’ll leave dishes until the next day and just general untidiness but they take it to a different level. 

All this filth (since my refusal to clean it anymore) has brought some new roommates for us, mainly giant ass rats! Which seem to have moved into our yard. 

The kicker is, they are both ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED of rats. 

A plan soon hatched in my mind and with a bit of creativity, some invisible thread and an old bristle broom, I now had a “faux rat” (I named him Ronald)

Every few days or so for the past 2weeks ish I have been placing it in the corner of the kitchen, waiting for one of them to walk in. Then I yank Ronald as hard as I can at an angle so he shoots towards them. Each time they’ve ran from the kitchen screaming in fear. 
I won’t lie I very much enjoyed doing it at first but kinda felt guilty at having made a grown man bawl his eyes out and thought the lesson has probably been learned. 

So I decided  we had to have a house meeting about the infestation and how they don’t feel safe in the home anymore (personally I didn’t feel safe with a pan of veggie rice rotting on the countertop for 12days but hey ho!).

I simply stated that if they’re just cleaned up their junk the rats would most likely disappear. 

Lo and behold the place was spotless within an hour and since then there has been a lot less mess. 

Ronald has been put into retirement and is resting in my bedroom ready to pounce if ever needed again.

So a bit of a weird update since my wife actually saw this thread through her coworker. (e: to clarify, the coworker didn't know that it was about my wife, she was just sharing an interesting thread)

She texted me asking if I was looking to buy a new bed and I said yes without thinking much of it. She then linked me this thread and said we would talk later that night (not in a bad way).

We sat down and she apologized for calling me a baby and I apologized for starting a fight over something so small. 

She said that she really enjoys the pillow but we can get rid of it and sleep together instead. I told her this isn't necessary and that I would deal with it but she insisted. 

I've ordered her a new body pillow that just covers one side of her that she could put on the opposite side of me so hopefully everyone can be comfortable. 

Everything worked out and we have been sleeping together for the past couple weeks now. The new body pillow came in and is on the opposite side of her. She switches between me and the pillow every now and then and it's not a big deal. A lot more comfortable to sleep now too haha. 


Thanks to everyone who Pmed me giving me advice as well as those giving advice in the comments. 

I tried to emphasize this as much as I could in the comments but seriously my wife and I never fight and this was extremely out of the norm for us. 

Everything is good now though and we are going to start doing date nights again on Saturday and it's been going well. Feels more like our relationship when it was just starting out in the ""honey moon"" period kinda thing. 

But yeah, everything's fine now. To be honest it was always fine, this was just a minor thing that some how got blown out of proportion. I barely remember but I think we were both just stressed with work that day so we ended up getting into a silly fight. 

Seriously I love my wife so hopefully no judgement by you guys on the one comment she said back then. She's honestly a really good person!

I made an update thread a few weeks back but was a few days early for the minimum and someone commented on the old thread a few days ago so I remembered to repost the update thread today with a few more updates.

Thanks everyone :)

AITA for wanting my girlfriend to wear makeup and take care of body hair?,21268,Asshole,7067,cqin60,1565858619.0,"I know how the title sounds, hear me out. My \[26M\] gf \[24F\] takes forever in the bathroom. Upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. When I playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago I was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. She said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. I told her that I got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that I also do to stay presentable. Her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. Now she's saying I have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which I find crazy as I'm not her sugar daddy. Why should I pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby?

I understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. I haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am I enforcing any ultimatums. If, as she says, I've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. If we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should I pay? Anyone who says I'm TA, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? Be honest with yourselves.

**Gf's side:** He keeps being a dick about how long I would take in the bathroom, so as he said, I quit things he didn't even realize I was doing. No makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, I have curly frizzy hair so I stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. Do I look like a beast? Sure. Am I a comfy, smug beast? Hell yes.

He rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so I obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. I'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that I stopped, I feel like... why do I ever have to do all this shit. It's unfair. And if I have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. I conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. Conservatively. He should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. Otherwise it's not fair.

**Both:** We love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. We recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion.

**EDIT (from bf):** alright, I'm the asshole. You know, it wasn't even the people saying I *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying I wasn't. No way in hell do I want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think I'm not TA then I definitely am. My girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, ""in stained shirts and greasy hair"". Jesus.

I think it's reasonable to say that I'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case I would either pay up or we break up. However, luckily, I am still very much into her. I would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and I think those who pointed out that I should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. As I said before, this was never a fight. And for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me I can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight.

**EDIT 2 (from gf):** Thank you, Reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. He let me shave his legs. He said he feels like a dolphin. I've decided his genuine contrition and heartfelt apologizing is enough for me and will resume shaving my pits for him, and doing my brows and hair (I didn't spend years subscribed to r/curly only to let my hair turn into a shitshow now)",True,1565913115.0,2019-08-15 01:43:39
AITA for telling my British neighbors they should learn chinese because we live in china?,21249,Not the A-hole,2114,d5xhpn,1568840678.0,I saw s similar post which inspire me this. I’m Albanian and I live in Guangzhou China. I live in an apartment building that’s filled wit mostly Chinese people and one British couple. They’ve been here 3 years longer than I have and can’t say anything other than NIHAO and XIEXIE. They constantly knock on my door or call me to translate chinese stuff to which I told them to stop and start learning chinese. I taught myself to be half fluent in Chinese before I got my work assignment and learnt the rest in the 6 months I’ve been here. They managed to get by because some of the staff spoke basic English but they left. I told them that they’ve been here for several years and should be at least conversational in chinese. Yeag chinese is hard butvits inconsiderate and rude to not put any effort into learning chinese. I told them im never translating for them again and they lost their shit saying I’m an asshole and I’m making their lives difficult.

AITA for surrendering my sister's child to protective services when she forced me to babysit due to mental health?,21225,Not the A-hole,4662,dfp1yq,1570691081.0,"I'm 26M, my sister is 28F. We're the only family we both have, neither of our parents are with us anymore and we have no aunts, uncles, or cousins. I'm single, so is my sister: she's a single mother of a 3 year old. Despite all of this, we're not particularly close. We live in the same city but I might see her once a year in passing.

To make a long and convoluted post short, last week she came to my house and offloaded her son to me. She said she had to go to the hospital for mental health and I was the only person who could help. I couldn't even protest, she didn't even come inside. She took him in the car seat, put him on my porch, rang the bell, and told me all of this as she's walking back to her car. She left no diapers, no supplies, no nothing, not even a word of when she'll be back.

It took me less than four hours to contact police and have child services involved. He was basically abandoned with me, or at least that was my thoughts. They took the child away and my sister is still in the hospital. I have no way of contacting her, nor has she tried to contact me. I can't imagine the hellstorm that's going to be unleashed when she's out.

I'm just not equipped to handle a kid. My home isn't child proof, I have no friends who could babysit for a stranger, even as a favor. I work full time, I'm in school. I couldn't think of any alternative besides getting child services involved. I feel like I let my sister down but first and foremost I believe she let her own child down. I don't know what's going to happen.

Was I the asshole?

**edit**: just so there's more info, I wasn't even left the base the car seat latches into. Never mind I don't even have a car. I'll admit I could have asked a friend for help picking up children stuff but that doesn't address anything else.

Child services is what its name implies, here where I live it's called FACS. They work with families in struggling times like this. I told them my sister's name, the hospital she's at, and they presumably are working with her to sort this out. They left contact information but they won't disclose any status to me because I'm not the parent. Even just the status of my sister, they weren't at liberty to say.

I didn't ""put the kid up for adoption"" it doesn't work like that. I contacted this agency who is trained to help in situations like this, where living arrangements are difficult or impossible for a child. My best guess is they have him in a foster home for now until my sister's out. I don't know anything else beyond my best guess.

And I can't just take time off work or school to care for a child 24/7 when agencies like the one I contacted can offload the work for me. It's been 8 days and no word on anything: if I took eight days off work with no telling when I could return, I might as well not return.",False,1570680064.0,2019-10-10 00:04:41
AITA for not taking my girlfriend's side over a sexist tradition at a restaurant?,21211,Asshole,6436,g2gh5m,1587077944.0,"I (M26) am a second generation French immigrant to the US. I speak French and most of my family lives in France, so I try to make a trip back to France once or twice a year.

I have been dating an American girl (F24) for two years now. My girlfriend does not speak French at all. The actual events in question happened this winter.

I usually go to France around Christmas time. The most recent Christmas, my girlfriend wanted to come with me. I said sure as she had never been to France before and we'd been dating almost two years so it seemed reasonable. 

My family comes from the South West, but I also have family in Paris so we stopped in Paris first. My gf wanted to eat at a fancy French restaurant while we were there, something with Michelin stars. Expensive, but not really a problem since I make pretty good money.

We made a reservation for a good restaurant, not the best but still good. We had to make it months in advance because it's a restaurant that's high in demand. As a very upscale restaurant, there was also a dress code and things like that.

We showed up and everything was fine at first. They took our coats, we sat down, the restaurant was beautiful, etc. The waiter then gave us our menu. I had to do all the communication as my gf doesn't speak French.

I was showing my gf something on my menu and she noticed that mine had prices and hers didn't. I had completely forgotten about this tradition because it's just not common at all in the US.

She asked me why mine had prices but not hers. I explained to her that it was just a tradition in many upscale French restaurants. She called it sexist and said it was ridiculous. I told her that it's just the way it is in these kinds of places, and that we shouldn't have come here if she was upset by this.

She wanted me to ask for a menu with prices for her. I refused because we already had the prices and I didn't want to make a scene. She demanded that I confront a waiter about it or she would walk out. I called her bluff and she ended up staying, but didn't talk to me for the whole meal, which was delicious by the way.

We've been back home for several months but she keeps bringing it up. I'm honestly considering ending the relationship over this because she will not stop talking about. She keeps accusing me of being sexist (I'm not) and has been making ridiculous comparisons.

AITA for telling my fiancee there's no take-backs?,21184,Not the A-hole,411,f0jzt9,1581151789.0,"Here's the thing: I 27M proposed to my 26F fiancee(yay!). The proposal time was a surprise but the actual proposal was not, she knew it was coming for a while but this is where it starts to get a little weird. I got her advice and opinions on the *PERFECT* ring for her. We both make decent money but I wanted it to be special so I saved up about $9000 of my spending money over the years(we live together) so I can afford to have the perfect ring for her. She was pointing out this ring and that ring and these rings how perfect they were, what her ring size was, what kind of cut she wanted, what setting, what band, etc...


Anyways I landed on the perfect ring for her, she approved of it, and we were all set just waiting for it to be fitted properly. The ring came in about 3 weeks before the proposal and I made it special and she said yes, excitedly. I'm talking dinner, wine, roses, backrubs, movie in bed, THE WHOLE SHEBANG. There was not a detail I missed, I can assure you I went full perfect boyfriend(fiance now) lmao


Cue to now, which is now 5 weeks after the proposal, and suddenly the whole style of cut and setting that she wanted for her ring is awful. Apparently she made a HUGE mistake with what she wanted and now suddenly she doesn't like it. I asked her ""Maybe just wait a few weeks and see if your mind changes? You never know, maybe this is just proposal jitters or something"" and no she's adamantly against it. I told her in no uncertain terms that this ring cost me a lot of money and we did research for months(almost a full year) together and I thought her mind was made up. I can't return the ring so now I'm kind of fucked and she's crying and telling me to leave her alone all night tonight. I personally think she's being childish but I called my mom and she tells me that I should have gotten her something she wanted. I told her that I DID get her something she wanted but now she doesn't want it, now my mom is telling me to just sell it for a loss and get one she does want. I said fuck all that, not trying to be mean but I'm not going to return a ring that cost me almost 5 figures just because she changed her mind TWO MONTHS after I bought it and had proposed. I think she's talking to her friends now but idk what to think anymore. Am I being an asshole by not returning it? I could *technically* afford it but this will put a huge dent in my savings and our overall account in general not to mention how stressful all this has been for me.

AITA for banning my parents from my wedding if they don’t attend a tea ceremony?,21159,Not the A-hole,1877,gou7bj,1590218569.0,"I’m (29f) going to get married this September (if a certain unnamed virus let us). For important context, I am white but my fiancée (31m) is Chinese-American. I’m going to admit that I’m one of those girls who has been planning her dream wedding since I was a girl. 
My husband doesn’t care as much and told me that I could plan the entire thing to my heart’s content with one caveat - there’s an important Chinese tea ceremony wherein the bride and groom make tea for both sets of parents and then the parents give them gifts. It’s incredibly important to him and the only thing he wants on our wedding day (Okay, he also consulted on the food and he wants to marry me lol).

He’s been planning that which will happen shortly before the wedding and will be a smaller ceremony with only family and very close friends. Today, while zooming with my parents, my parents said they found the whole ritual absurd and stupid and that she was going to skip it. Well, considering they’re an integral part of it, that doesn’t work for me. They couldn’t even explain why they thought the ritual was stupid, just that it was. I basically told them that if they skipped the tea ceremony, they should skip the wedding as well.

That led to a lot of crying and arguments and now my parents aren’t talking to me and my sisters have sent me texts about how irrational I’m being, how I’m being cruel, and how I’m being a bridezilla. But...this is important to my future husband so it’s important to me. It’s the only thing he really insisted upon for this wedding. But they are my parents and I want them to beat my wedding.

"AITA for not punishing my son after he came up with a pretty elaborate plan to ""peep"" on the neighbor girl topless in her back yard?",21135,Asshole,3390,ccqos4,1563061158.0,"Lots and lots of ugly background here but I'll try not to wander. My wife I have been separated for 2 years, ink to paper on an ugly and contentious divorce in May. I have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years. 

On Monday I came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. I asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. They said they were playing army and since I've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, I knew their parents wouldn't mind either. So I told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case I needed him to come down. I was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. So they did this every day this week until Thursday when my daughter came home from her CIT job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if I was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing Army and let me know that the real reason is that our 22 year old neighbor was in her back yard topless and Aiden had set up a perch on the sun deck to get a better view. I climbed up thinking that she was just trying to get him in trouble but sure enough, the deck had  perfect view of the chaise lounge where I assume the girl had usually sat. I told my son to knock it off and he said he would. 

This morning I got an angry knock on the door and it was my ex wife and the neighbor (they have been friends for many years) apparently the neighbor called my wife sometime mid week and they had agreed they would ""confront"" me and my son Saturday morning. We sat down and it went from a calm ""this is something we're concerned about"" to accusations of me being an irresponsible absentee parent and my son leading an ""adolescent sex ring"" in a matter of seconds. I tried to remain calm and explain that they are just acting like 14 year old boys and I've gotten them to stop. My wife asked if I planned on punishing him, I said that I don't feel like he did anything punishment worthy and rather this was a learning experience about respecting peoples privacy. My neighbor said that if he were her son he'd be in intensive psycho therapy and medicated. I told her that was really overkill. My wife told me not to talk to her friend like that and I asked them to leave before it got any more nuts. My wife has texted me that I am being incredibly irresponsible and if I don't do ""something"" she's going to her lawyer to revisit the custody arrangement. In all of that she called me an asshole several times and said it was more miserable being divorced from me than it was to be married to me. yay weekend!

AITA for not defending my cousin after he stole my baby name?,21108,Not the A-hole,1991,f8uwin,1582595011.0,"I’m currently 31 weeks pregnant with my first child- a little girl!  I’ve known for years what I want to name my child.  The first name has sentimental meaning for me, and my husband and I chose the second name together.  We’ve planned the name for years- when we were dating and talking about the future, one of the things we always said was that our firstborn would have this name.  It’s gender neutral, so it didn’t matter if it was a girl or a boy.  

As soon as we found out I was pregnant, we started referring to the baby by name.  Because we’ve had this name in mind for so many years, our whole family knows the name and the meaning behind it.  We’ve already started decorating the nursery with little items that have the name or initials on them. There’s basically been no question that this would be our child’s name.

My cousin’s wife gave birth two weeks ago.  They had refused to tell anyone what name(s) they were thinking about during the pregnancy, which is fine.  But the name that they ended up choosing is pretty much exactly the same as the name my husband and I chose for our baby.  It’s exactly the same first name and then an almost identical second name.  It would be like if our baby’s name was Mary Elizabeth, then the name they chose is Mary Eliza. The actual name isn’t as traditional/common as that, so it really does stand out as being the same name.

I was pretty upset when I found out, because they definitely knew the name we’d chosen and it feels weird and kind of spiteful to use it.  I know we don’t own the name or anything, so we can’t stop them from using it, but it still felt pretty icky.  My husband and I basically decided to just be sort of privately weirded out but to try our best to ignore it.  I sent my cousin a text to tell him and his wife congrats on the baby, and then didn’t reach out any further than that. I didn’t say anything to him about the name.

Well, it turns out that even though my husband and I are trying to take the high road here, the rest of the family is pretty mad.  Apparently, a bunch of them (including my cousin’s mom) have reached out and told my cousin and his wife that what they did is really shitty and that they need to think about changing their baby’s name. They’ve also reached out to me to say that they think it’s awful and that they know how much meaning the name has for me.  I absolutely didn’t ask them to do this, but I can’t pretend I’m not happy that people are “taking our side.”

My cousin called me yesterday and said that I need to call all of our family and tell them to stop pressuring him about the name and that I’m fine with it, because they’re ruining his and his wife’s time with their newborn.  I have no intention of doing so because A) I didn’t ask them to talk to him about it in the first place and B) I’m not fine with it; I think it’s weird that he and his wife did this and I have no interest in defending him.

I call my husband and tell him and he’s like “Oh ok did you get on the pill?” And I said no, I didn’t want to be on hormones anymore and he flipped out and said I need to be on birth control because it’s the best way to not get pregnant but like, there are things he can do to not get me pregnant but now his whole family and him are convinced I’m like trying to get pregnant without his consent.

My older sister has had trouble with drugs, alcohol, and the law our entire life. She has been bakeracted no less than 20 times since her 18th birthday and has actually technically died twice due to her decisions(she's back by the grace of the medical professionals treating her). My dad has constantly bailed her out on anything whether it be jail or missing rent payments because she spent the money on drugs.

My dad had cancer for the last decade. Despite my sister and him already living in the same apartment complex and my dad paying the entirety of her rent, my husband and I were essentially forced to move across our city 3 months before our wedding because Dad was starting chemo and needed extra help. My next 3 years were devoted to caring for dad. I lost 2 jobs due to the time I needed to take off to care for him and my sister continued to mooch and do absolutely nothing for him. I was the one expected to make medical decisions for him alone because he didn't trust my sister not to try to off him for his money.

Dad is now finally at peace and against my better judgment, I asked my sister to come by so she could say her goodbyes. Before they even came to take him from his apartment to the funeral home, she was demanding that I open and read the will. She insisted that Dad had been paying for her to try to finally earn her Bachelors and she needed 2k. This amount changed to 3k within 24 hours. She started pointing at Dads belongings and said that she was ""claiming items she wanted"". 

After I finally read the will (I'm the executor of the estate), we learned that Dad left everything to me except for creating a trust fund for my niece that my sister cant touch until her 21st. My sister lost her mind and started demanding that I split what I got from him. Dad also left specific instructions to me and my husband to use what he had left us to buy a house, pay off our debts, and finally start a family and we really want to honor his last wishes, but we wouldn't be able to if I split it with my sister.

Me (31 F) & kids (2 F, 4 M) moved with my husband  (31 M) from where we met, married & had our children in California to Texas. We always said we would raise our kids in small town Texas where my husband grew up. It was his dream & I was happy to support him!
When we moved – to a house a few blocks away from his parents – we thought we would be getting some help from his parents with the kids. They babysat the oldest twice in 8 months. They showed very little interest in the kids but had my husband over multiple times a week doing things for them (they are in their 60s & in good health) & did come over to dinner a few times. He adored his parents & they adored him. Their only child. Their golden boy. 

My husband was diagnosed with a rare cancer that was terminal earlier in the year. He died within 5 weeks of diagnosis. It was tragic & I am still in shock. When he was dying he was in a great deal of pain & on morphine & wasn’t always coherent or thinking straight. However he told me his parents were devastated I would move the kids back to where I grew up in Canada & they wouldn’t be able to watch the kids grow up. Well…that was my exact plan. My parents are the most amazing grandparents & help my sister out a lot (2 days a week of full babysitting!) & would do the same for me. Canada has a great education & healthcare system & my siblings & parents are live near each other so the kids and I would have a support network.

I lied to my husband. I told him I would stay & raise the kids as Texans as we had planned. He was in so much pain & distress & I couldn’t add to it. I chose the easy way out.

2 weeks after the funeral I moved my sweet babies home to Canada. My parents in law are now telling everyone I betrayed a dying man’s last wish.

________________________________________________

I'm a 19F currently attending university.

One of my main professor's insists on using the whiteboard in class, for explaining everything and anything. Whether it's words or diagrams or explanations, so it's pretty important to be able to read.

Here's the problem: i'm colourblind and i cannot distinguish the difference between red and green ... like at all. It just looks the same to me.

This is a common problem so i ALWAYS carry a black and blue white board marker pen with me to give to a teacher in case there isn't a blue one around. It saves time and embarrassment on my behalf.

So i tell my professor my problem and the first lecture goes fine, he doesn't use green, and uses my blue and black pens instead (idk why but this room only had green and red). The next lecture however, i give over my pen and he starts to use the green and red pens to explain graphs and stuff. Completely un-understandable to me. So i raise my hand in a room of like.. 120 people.. and ask him if he can use the blue pen i gave him so i can actually see the difference in lines.

The professor then kinda... scoffed? And said he couldn't change now or the rest of the class would get confused. I just nodded and looked away because his tone was so condescending. The rest of lecture he used green and red so i just couldn't write up my notes.

(Insert- a super amazing girl in front of me asked for my email and sent me her notes that she was creating on her computer. She even changed all the colouring so i could see it properly and i was so shocked when i got them i nearly cried (people dont do this often lol)).

Anyway i email the professor and ask him one last time if he could just use a blue pen instead of red or green and he emailed back almost instantly to tell me that a lot of work is done in green and red and ill probably struggle with it anyway! 

I got so mad i emailed up the head of our school and told them everything i said here. The next day rumour was going around he was suspended and i got a confirmation of it later that day when the head of school contacted me for a meeting in a few days.

I feel pretty bad. I don't want this guys career to suffer just because of some pens haha. The stress is getting to me. AITA reddit?",False,1579884505.0,2020-01-23 22:02:08
AITA for threatening to sue my sister because her kids broke my iPad?,20948,Not the A-hole,5836,egwqp2,1577598236.0,"This happened a couple of days before Christmas. 

My sister, her 3 kids (4,6,8), and I were all staying at my parents house for the holidays. 
I have a 1TB iPad Pro (the largest screen model) that I use for my job. I do digital commissions, design band posters, design flyers to make money on the side as I’m in college. I saved up for a year to buy this iPad, it was an investment in my hobby. 

I left the iPad plugged up in my fathers study where I was working on some projects the night before. I got up in the morning to find the thing *shattered* in the living room. My sister nonchalantly apologized and said “oh sorry the kids broke your screen. Dad says he has a new one he’ll give you to replace it.”  She didn’t even bother to wake me up when she saw that they were broke it. I asked her why she wasn’t watching her fucking kids, and how they got my iPad from my fathers study. She said that she *gave it to them* so they could watch YouTube. 
I obviously started yelling at her, and asked her how she could be to obtuse as to let her kids play with my stuff without asking. She called me selfish. “They’re my niece and nephews and I should want to share with them.” Wtf.

My dad tried to give me a iPad Air, and tell me that it was the same thing. I told him it was unacceptable and I wanted my iPad replaced *immediately*. He said he didn’t have the money, so I went to my sister and demanded the money. She tried to ask if she could make payments as the cost would wipe out her savings, and I said no way. I wanted the full cost of the iPad, the pencil , AND the $250 that I’m going to miss out on because I couldn’t finish the project I was working on It would be around $2200 dollars. 

She tried to call me heartless, and told me to think of my niece and nephew. I told her to go fuck herself, if she was a better mother she’d have more than 2k saved up when she has three kids. My parents think I’m over reacting, but I don’t. She is trying to avoid me and not speak to me, and I told her that I would be suing her then for the full cost of my iPad and lost wages.
She’s acting like a total bitch, and crying on social media about how her heartless brother is trying to sue her and break her and her children over an “honest mistake”. I’ve gotten calls from several family members calling me a bad brother, and asking me to reconsider. I can’t believe this is happening. WIBTA for suing my “poor broke sister” because she can’t watch her fucking kids?

My car broke down recently and I've been taking the bus/subway to work and she's been razzing me about it saying its sketchy taking public transport etc. I told her I'm saving up again for a honda, and will get it next month. She just tells me to ask my parents for the money or dip into my savings. I told her she has no idea how most people live real life so she shouldn't be giving out financial advice because her dad funds her whole life. She got very pissed at me and said that she's not dumb and so on and basically called me a huge asshole.

I (31M) have been with my girlfriend (Claire) for 2 years, 3 in January

I’ve got a 4 year old with an ex, we have her every other week.

Claire got pregnant 8 months ago, which is why we made the choice to move in with each other, 5 months into the pregnancy she gave birth, the baby didn’t make it.

Claire hasn’t been the same since which  while I   don’t fully understand, it was my baby too.

Claire has been in therapy since to help her grieve.

When my daughter came over to visit last, she drew on the wall which I completely understand but Claire made a point of sending her up to her bedroom for 90 minutes.

She continues making snide remarks towards my daughters mother and is over all really strict on my daughter, any toe out of line it’s straight to her bedroom 

Claire suggested we don’t have my daughter for a week until we’ve grieved properly and maybe stick to weekends and visiting her after school until then.

I told her if she continues doing this and continues being spiteful that she can leave, she is in no way priority over my daughter?

I understand her grief, I do.

AITA for not going to wedding after agreeing to be best man?,20873,Not the A-hole,1407,ha2zwm,1592339138.0,"Last year my best childhood friend (28M) asked me (28M) to be best man at his wedding, and I happily agreed. I think the process brought us closer together as we talked weekly for the next few months planning logistics and the bachelor party.

I worked hard on the bachelor party, which was a far away vacation. I spent months planning, and lots of money. I found time in everyone's schedule and booked an amazing vacation, it was a blast! I was his only childhood friend at the bachelor party, and everyone else was from his college frat. It was therefore like a typical college party setting, I did my best to learn all the drinking games they already knew how to play, and I thought we had a great time. 

I guess I was out of my element, however, because my friend later told me that he felt like he bonded with his other friends better that weekend, and how he wants one of them to be the bestman instead.

So I calmly told him that's fine, and that I won't be coming to the wedding because I feel like my efforts as a pre-bestman were underappreciated, and I feel uncomfortable traveling to spend a days with people who make me feel that way. 

He got upset, and his fiance told me I should ""grow up"" and be a good friend; I told them that we're all grownups, and we have no obligation to each other just because we're childhood friends. Friend and his fiance called me an asshole, so AITA?

AITA for charging rent from my dad but not from my mom?,20865,Not the A-hole,1514,fx7ox4,1586385861.0,"My father and his family lost their home and had no place to live. He has a teenage son, my half brother, who is 15 and a known smoker. Because they had nowhere else to go, I offered them to stay at our other house we usually rent out to other people. The house is situated within our property, just next to our home. 

Prior to my dad moving in, my mother and my sister moved in with us 6 months ago after my stepdad passed away. 

We have many spare bedrooms in our home so them moving in wasn't a problem. . 

This is where the conflict arises :

I don't charge rent from my mom. I don't let her cook. I cook for 5 people in our home (my husband, my mom, my toddler and my sister). It's just my way of looking out for my mom because that's what she did for me when I was young and struggling. She raised me as a single mother for years.. 

My dad has a problem with this because I am charging him and his wife the same rent I charge other tenants (it's a well furnished house). He thinks I'm playing favourites between parents because I don't charge my mom any money. He thinks he should pay less rent as compared to other tenants because I'm his daughter.

 Apparently, he doesn't like to be reminded of the fact that he charged me rent the one time when I was very sick and had to move in with him and his wife when I was in college. I had a part time job, and struggled to pay my bills with my illness. I wasn't shown any consideration. 

He also has a problem because my husband doesn't help him out with his groceries. He is older now, 71 and thinks we should be the one getting him his groceries. We don't think so, his wife is 50 and he has a young son. They can be the ones doing the grocery shopping if he's to fragile to move around.

I had dinner with him the other day and as usually he bitched about how child support is unfair, etc. I told him for the first time that it’s his fault. He chose to have sex knowing the risk of pregnancy. He got mad and said it’s not fair because women can abort but men can’t, I told him he knew that before he has sex with her but he still risked it.

AITA for telling my husband to grow a pair,20833,Not the A-hole,3632,g77rzf,1587761275.0,"My husband and I have been together for 16 years, married for 11. He has always had a pretty low pain tolerance though he won’t admit it (once he accidentally kneeled on one of our toddler’s hot wheels cars and it put him out of commission for the entire day although nothing was broken or even bruised). I’ve become alarmed many times at his over reactive response to things like stubbing his toe or hitting his funny bone on something, he will literally moan and whine and shout out in pain over the most minor stuff. 

I always thought of it as a quirk of his, not too major to actually have a conversation about, until yesterday. I have what my doctors believe is Crohn’s disease, and I’ve been in the thick of a nasty flare-up for the last few days. For those of you unfamiliar, it’s an inflammatory bowel disease and causes diarrhea, vomiting, etc. I was trying to take a nap for some relief and had just gotten to sleep, when I hear an actual scream from downstairs. I jump out of bed and find my husband clutching his hand. I asked what happened and he told me he pinched his finger in the baby gate. I looked at it and it wasn’t even red, no broken skin. 

I told him he woke me up with his scream and probably also woke up our son, and he said he couldn’t help it, it just hurt so bad. I said ‘you know what else hurts? Shitting my brains out all morning and not being able to take a nap because you’re being so loud over a minor mishap’. He got really offended and said that I wouldn’t like it if I pinched my finger either and I said no I sure wouldn’t but I also wouldn’t scream my head off, I didn’t even do that when I was giving birth to a 9-lb baby unmedicated. He said well your body was made to do that, I’m not made to get my finger stuck in a baby gate. This is when I rolled my eyes, told him to grow a pair, and went back upstairs to try and rest.

Yes, I said it out of anger, but my husband is acting like I emasculated him horribly and insulted him to his very core and is barely speaking to me. I’m not in any hurry to apologize especially since he didn’t for waking me up when I’m dealing (pretty silently) with objectively more pain than he was.

ETA: I can pretty definitively say that he doesn’t have an underlying medical condition. He has to get medical checkups for work regularly. I honestly agree with most of the comments stating he just wants attention; the overreactions ramp up when I’m having a flare or when we’re at a big family gathering or something.",False,1587741616.0,2020-04-24 13:47:55
AITA for embarrassing a girl trying to steal from me,20814,Not the A-hole,1035,g214cd,1587014750.0,"I made this account because I'm tired of the passive aggressive bull this girl keeps throwing at me, so I want to see if I'm the ass or her. 

Firstly,  I'm a guy,  26, who tries to have the healthiest life style I can.  I also make a good amount of money and can buy the natural lotions and skin care/bath care products I can get. These aren't cheap and when I do get them I make sure I use them smartly and make them last. 

My roommate and I get along great, she doesn't touch my things in the bathroom and I don't touch hers. She has her own shelf,  I have mine.  She does have a friend who comes over sometimes who is a self proclaimed beauty guru who does reviews on line to her 500 followers. But doesn't have a job and 'borrows' products from her friends. 

A few months ago she came over, and I had just gone to my room to get dressed,  products left on the tub bench, and I hear her in the bathroom practically squealing ""girl you got the good stuff! Let me use it, my followers will love it!""

I hear my roommate say no that it's not hers and the friend just says quietly that she'll use it when I go to work. After I get out of my room to head to work I immediately get my products put them in my room and listen to her start to do her show in our living room,  stating what products she's about to get to which I say loudly. 

""No you're not, I bought them, if you want them then get a job and buy them."" I then locked them in my room and since then she's told me how she lost followers, got mocked for trying to steal and was sobbing in her live stream.

AITA for purposefully making my meal-prep super spicy to stop my BF from eating it?,20822,Not the A-hole,1991,g36usa,1587174600.0,"Okay so my boyfriend atm stays home and I work three 12s a week. That said, I like to meal prep so I don’t have to cook every day for my lunches. 

Well, my boyfriend, WHO STAYS HOME ALL DAY, thinks it’s a good idea to eat my lunches while i’m at work. I’ve asked him to stop but he says, “But your food is so good. Plus why don’t you make more so I can have some?” I’ve told him multiple times that I’m stressed and that I can’t make more meals because it’s a lot of work. 

So he continued to eat my food. I remember that he HATES spicy food while I really enjoy it. So what do I do? Add spice. A lot of it. 

Last time he ate something of mine, he called me yelling at me. He said I was being an asshole and that I know he hates spicy food. I told him, “Tough. Stop eating my food then.”

Now he’s mad at me....

Tl;dr- After asking my boyfriend NOT to eat my meal prepped food, I purposely made my latest meal preps SUPER spicy and now my boyfriend says I’m an asshole. AITA?

UPDATE: Holy smokes, I didn’t expect for this to blow up... as for some questions, doubling my recipes would take more time. I use a lot of veggies and rice when I cook and I homemake my sauces and which takes a lot of time. 

For those of you who say I need to dump him, it’s a big consideration, but it’s hard. He may not be the most considerate person and I’ve brushed it aside since I’ve been very lonely for a while. When we first started, he used to cook a lot for me and that was great. But after we moved in together, he changed and expected me to cook/shop/clean more often. Worst of all, dating for me is extremely difficult. I work in transportation, and while I have a schedule now, I used to have to work nights so dating was hard. A lot of dates were upset with  me and my job because of lack of availability. This guy seemed independent enough that me being gone for two to three days wasn’t a problem. For reference he’s early thirties and I’m late twenties. 

Honestly, I’m overwhelmed with what to do. We have a lease together and while I can fully support myself, he can’t since he’s laid off and I’d feel terrible to kick him to the curb. So for now, I’m logging out... thanks everyone.

UPDATE TWO: Okaaaaay so after a long conversation with my now ex-boyfriend... we decided to end it. I told him that eating my food wasn’t okay and that because he’s home all day since he was laid off, he still needs to carry his weight with the housework, shopping, and cooking like he used to when we first met. What happened? He had a Brett Kavanaugh style break down. Just started crying and saying it wasn’t fair because he’s stressed and shouldn’t have to worry about, and I quote, “Stupid things like cooking and cleaning.”  So I told him my perspective that I’m tired, I’m dealing with people all day, and I just want my lunch untouched or replaced when I meal prep. I mentioned that it was never a problem in the past and don’t understand why it’s an issue now. He just started yelling at me saying I was starting a stupid argument and that it’s not an issue. He doesn’t have the money to get takeout like he used or buy food. He said that because he was laid off, he needs me to buy all of the groceries, pay his half of the rent and utilities, and cook for him. 

We then got into other issues of our relationship and things that have been building for a while. These are things I’d rather not get into, but nonetheless, I told him I’m tired and honestly would be happier without him. He stopped crying, got all red faced, and started screaming at me. I told him to get his stuff, go to his parent’s house, and not come back.  When he tried to fight it, I told him that I won’t hesitate to call the cops since the neighbors probably heard him screaming at me. This Monday, he and I are going to the leasing office to get him off the lease. I’m in the process of boxing up his stuff for him to move out. I’d rather do it myself and have him take his boxed stuff than have him here and do it. The less time I have to see him, the less chance I’ll change my mind. 

Honestly, I cried a lot last night. But after a while, I realized it was nice to be alone in my own bed. I could actually spread out and enjoy it. Thank you to everyone who have been supportive. I’ve been unhappy in this relationship for a while and just didn’t know if breaking up was the best course of action.

She was my husband’s only sibling and it took a toll on him, it’s a sensitive issue.

When we had our daughter, his mother gave us boxes of his sister’s old toys because sister had always said she wanted to pass her toys to her own kids, but passed before she had any. This included a collection of collector Barbies that were still in the box. If you don’t know about these, they hold their value and are worth a lot. We gave my daughter the unboxed toys as she got older these past 5 years. I always said we should store the collector dolls until she was older. MIL agreed.

This year, our daughter turned 5. For her birthday, we got her a new bed and redesigned her room. My husband decided to put all of the collector dolls on shelves for “decoration”. I told him this was a mistake. Even though she’s 5, she doesn’t quite get the difference between these and her regular, playable barbies. Even after we explained it to her, she was asking when they could come out of the box. My husband still insisted they’d be fine. She barely plays in her room anyway, she has a playroom. I said fine, but I know if they get ruined, he’ll be crushed.

We had another baby last year. I was trying to get him to calm down the other day and my daughter was making a lot of noise. I asked her to take some toys into her room and play quietly. She said okay. When I went to check on her 15 minutes later, she had managed to get a collector Barbie off the shelf, torn the box and had severely damaged the Barbie by trying to get it out of the wires.

My husband was so mad at her. I told him he had no right to be, because she’s still too young to get it. I said they were sentimental and it’ll take time for her to get that she can’t play with toys we put in her room. My husband said I was an ass for not backing him up and that I was making excuses for her. I took all the dolls out of the room and said she’d get them back when she was older.

We have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like I have the kids Friday after school and then he gets them Monday after school. I get them back Wednesday after school and then he gets them Friday after school and then the week flip flops. We've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. I'm a nurse in the OR so I schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are with their dad. 

Recently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one will go with dad and one will be with me. My son said he would make sure he was with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if I have to get called in or can hang out at the hospital until I'm done. My ex is on board with this because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one another). While they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, I do not want to give up my free weekends. It took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities or travel.

My sister pointed out that if I was still married, then I wouldn't have all the child free time I have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like I do. My mom said she can't believe I'd deny my children quality time with their parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends.

His mom and I are divorced and don't have much of a relationship. Cordial, but indifferent. Our son is now 11 and my ex remarried a few years ago but she was with the guy for some time.

We have 50/50. She requested that she have him for two weeks for vacation. I agreed even though this ate into my time with him. Apparently, he got into it with step dad and he got grounded for a week. Well, most of that week is my week with him before he leaves for vacation with them and she asked me to see to it that his grounding continues through my time. I won't see him for three weeks. I am not saying not to punish him. 

Punish him when he's on their time. 

I have no problems with him when he's with me.

I refused.

I already made plans to make most if the days that I have him and I'm sure as hell am not going to cancel those plans because he mouthed off to step-dad. I don't care much for step-dad anyways. What I do with my son on my time is my business and vice-versa. 

Also, I don't want to set precedent where I am the parent who has to do both sides of discipline.

AITA for changing the package pickup each time someone uses my email for orders?,20782,Not the A-hole,1487,heoy9x,1592981319.0,"So pretty much, there’s this guy who keeps ordering things with my email. He isn’t using any other personal information of mine so i don’t think it’s a privacy concern. 

So back to the point, I will occasionally get emails from random websites about an order confirmation. I’ve never heard of most of those websites and I know for a fact none of my family members used my email to buy something.

With most emails, there’s a number, name and an address (I’m assuming it’s the persons address) attached. I’ve tried texting the number and even calling but I’ve never gotten an answer. 

I’d always get emails from ups to confirm the pickup/drop off area. Ever since I’ve gotten the emails, I always change the location for delivery. So instead of it being delivered at his doorstep, it gets shipped to a post office 20 miles away. He can’t change that since like I said, it’s all attached to my email.

I recently got an email from the guy and turns out, the reason he keeps writing my email is because his and mine are both almost identical. (Imagine mine is “abc” his is “acb”) so he always switches one letter therefore I get the emails. 

In his email, he calls me an asshole for making the pickup so far. When I asked him why can’t he just use his own email he said: It’s always a typo I do and I don’t feel like fixing it because it takes too much time.

I’m not even joking, that’s exactly what he said.

AITA for interrupting my roomates having sex in the kitchen while our mutual dinner is being made?,20753,Not the A-hole,1182,gxbjm2,1591415042.0,"Throwaway account btw. Two nights ago I walked into the kitchen to ask my roomates what they wanted to do for dinner. We started making some pasta, so I went to my bedroom (located directly next to the kitchen) to play some games while waiting for the pasta to cook. I hear the timer set on alexa go off, and my roomate moan ""Alexa stop."" I interrupt them by walking out there and announcing myself by asking ""Is dinner ready?"" So they have to quickly stop and pretend nothing was happening. I decide to stick around because dinner is practically done now. Female roomate goes to the bathroom, and I bring it up to male roomate while we're in the kitchen. I let him know I think it's inconsiderate for a couple reasons, and I really don't want to see that. While eating dinner, I send a similar message over snapchat to female roomate, who has been angry at me for two days now. Male roomate already had a more extensive conversation with me about it, and we agree about not having sex in a ""public"" place in the house. Am I the asshole?",False,False,2020-06-05 20:44:02
AITA for not telling people I’m not the celebrity they think I am?,20684,Not the A-hole,2312,ebtbnn,1576601311.0,"I look very similar to an actor and I live in New York City. 

Every so often a tourist would stop me and say “oh my gosh you’re that guy!” And I used to interrupt them and say “no I’m really not.”

But then this guy started starring in a TV show so became way more recognizable. It started so I was being stopped 3-5 times a day by people. 

Once I was in a mad rush and on the phone so when someone said “Aaahhhh you’re that guy can I take a selfie” I just smiled for the selfie and said have a great day. 

It was faster than explaining and insisting I’m not the guy while they accuse me of being too big for the fans, it was kind of funny to think of a picture of me floating around as a celebrity, and it was kind of nice to see how happy they looked when they thought they’d met this guy even for ten seconds. 

So now when people stop me I just take picture or shake their hand and move on. I thought it was just funny and never really thought much beyond that. 

But I was on a date the other night and the girl said “hey has anyone ever told you you look like that guy from that show” and I told her this story and she was horrified. 

She said it was so mean to mislead people that way. That hadn’t occurred to me and I really don’t want to be a dick to people, I thought it was something they’d eventually look back on and laugh too. Didn’t occur to me it would be so upsetting. 

So is she being oversensitive or am I being an asshole to tourists?",False,1576573443.0,2019-12-17 08:48:31
AITA for suddenly disinviting my father 4 days before my wedding ? He even paid for my wedding and I haven't spoken to him since.,20675,Not the A-hole,1207,g7fdye,1587787056.0,"Just to be clear, I got married in early February. 

I have always been very close to my father and stepmom growing up. I always felt like they offered me a stable home for me to grow up in. I never had that with my mother. During the last few years of my parents' marriage, my mother changed as a person. She was a happy and cheerful person when we were younger. She really changed after the divorce. She was miserable, and I felt that. I could tell that she hated the fact that I preferred to live with my dad, but never verbalized her feelings.

She has been single since the divorce, and refuses to date other people. I always wanted to have joint birthday parties with my mom, dad and stepmom, but my mom wouldn't have it. She avoided my father like the plague. I never understood her behavior and resented her for it.

Quite naturally, I preferred my dad's household over my mom's. Anyways, right before my wedding, I was staying at my dad's.

One night, I overheard my dad and stepmom reminiscing about how they met. Now they always told us that they met 6 months after the divorce at a library. Turns out, they lied.

They were talking about how my father couldn't take his eyes off her the moment she walked into his office and how he wanted her from that moment on, and how he didn't care that he had a pregnant wife at home.

Apparently their first kiss was a few days after I was born, and the first time they had sex was on my parents' 3rd anniversary. I was only a few months old back then. They were talking about how difficult it was for them to continue their relationship after they got caught when I was 5. This was extremely shocking to me because my parents got divorced when I was 10. They were also making fun of my mom's weight.

This meant that they carried on an affair throughout my parents' marriage. I remember my mom changing for the worse when I was in second grade.

My mom always knew and she never told me. I broke down crying that night and I felt really guilty because of the way I acted towards my mom growing up. I had no idea she went through so much. I was cheated on by my first boyfriend in college and it destroyed me. I felt horrible.

 That night, I didn't confront my dad but the next morning, I packed my shit up and transferred the amount he had spent on my wedding. I didn't want his money. I told him I heard every thing and asked him to stay away from my wedding.

I left their house and drove to my mom's. I hugged her really hard and we both cried.

I had my mom walk me down the aisle, and I made sure my dad's family didn't attend the wedding. I didn't explicitly disinvite my half brother, but he stayed away from my wedding and I'm actually glad be didn't come.

I don't think I want anything to do with any of them anymore.

I've heard from the grapevine that my dad is on anti depressants nowadays. My grandma blames me for his depression. 

Did I overreact? I still don't want anything to do with him. My dad's family think I was and I am being cruel to him. 

AITA?

AITA for going out in a pair of shorts?,20608,Not the A-hole,625,fmfd13,1584827921.0,"So I (23M) am covered in burn scars over every inch of my body with the exception of my face, neck and back. For context, my house went on fire when I was 10 and I was lucky to survive. It was obviously traumatising and after a long time of hating my body, I became an alcoholic in my teens to cope. When I was 20, I went drunk driving, crashed my car and my right leg was amputated from the knee and I’ve worn a prosthetic leg ever since.

Since it’s March, the weather is warmer now and I had to go out to get some standard shopping so I on instinct wore a jumper and shorts with it as it’s not cold out. On full display was my prosthetic and my badly scarred left leg. I should  also note I received a skin graft on that leg, so some of the skin is more visible and scarred than other portions.

Anyway, I decided to take a little walk before going to the store and I cut through a park. There isn’t much people around but there’s a few out. I got a couple of stares but that’s normal and I got to the store. I browsed for the stuff I needed like normal and when I got to checkout, there was a huge queue. I was expecting this so I was waiting and eventually, a mom and her son of about 3/4 went in line behind me. Nothing was said but I could feel the kid staring at me and he eventually started crying.

I then get a pat on my shoulder from the mom asking if I’d let them go in front of me so they wouldn’t have to stare at my “deformed leg” and my “robot one” as I was really upsetting her kid. I got really offended and told her that I wasn’t letting her skip and that some people happen to have visible deformities and that I’m allowed to wear shorts. My turn eventually came but she called me an AH and being inconsiderate to her kids feelings.

AITA for refusing to call my dad’s girlfriend ‘mom’ or obeying her rules?,20562,Not the A-hole,2007,eh6n83,1577659370.0,"Edit:

Wow!! I’ve never expected this post to blow up like this. I expected about 10 reactions 

First of all: Thank you so so much for your comments, all of the amazing advise and support, and all of the DM’s. (and the rewards!)  You are amazing people and its actually hard for me to put in words how I feel about this. It’s great to read all kinds of opinions on this! though I haven’t been able to read all comments and DM’s yet

My current plan is to firstly have a talk alone with my dad. I want to share my feelings with him about this situation. Then I want the three of us (without my brothers) to talk. If that doesn’t work, I’ll try to find a professional to help us out to find a solution :) One way or another, I’ll find someone to support me in the mourning process. I’ve already contacted my uncle for help. 

TBH I am kinda overwhelmed by the number of comments and DM’s and this is not an easy process for me. Sorry if I’m slow to respond :) 

\---------------------------------------

Original post:

Throwaway because some people might recognize me.

I (17M) currently live in my fathers house, my brothers (13 and 11) live there too. I’ve always had a great bond with my mother, but she died about two years ago, which deeply traumatized me.

Half a year later, my dad started to date someone else, let’s call her Elise (32f), she’s currently living at our place as well. Don’t get me wrong, Elise is not a bad person. My brothers really needed someone to cling to and she really takes good care for them. She makes dad smile again.

However, she is a lot more controlling than my mom was. I am quite independent, do chores around the house, have friends and go out etc. But she insists that I should follow her rules, to be home at a certain time etc. I don’t like that. I’m used to have more freedom and am actually planning to move out next year, I don’t want to risk losing my friends over her controlling behavior. I am respectful towards her, trying not to pick a fight, but she’s not someone I would want to share me feelings with.

She also insists that I call her ‘mom’ like my brothers do but I refuse. For me there was only one mother in my life and calling Elise mom just feels wrong, as if I’m forgetting my real mom. I also feel like if I call her mom I would accept that she has authority over me, but I never chose this person, my dad did. My dad just wants everyone to get along and live a happy new family but is afraid of confrontation and in general just lacks a spine. He also doesn’t like it if anyone mentions my real mom so I can barely talk to him about her.

Elise has called me an unruly teenager multiple times. When I got home ‘late’ she gets angry. Among other things she’s told me at times that I refuse to accept her even though she’s trying, that I am the one thing stopping this family from being happy again. That I’m confusing my brothers by refusing to call her mom (which I doubt). I told her she should accept that I’m not a kid, that I’m still getting over the loss of someone she hasn’t even met. That the only mom I ever had is not here anymore and that if anyone could set rules on me, it would be my dad. One time when she was furious she told me to ‘get over it already’. I told her to go fuck herself, she has no idea what I went through.

AITA for kicking my roommate out for something that her friend did?,20565,Not the A-hole,1279,haq9ie,1592426094.0,"I am a 37 year old man and my roommate is an early-30s woman. I rent a two-bedroom house and it had a spare room, so I decided to look for a roommate last year. I had a couple of people interested, but a friend asked me for a favor and I let her move in. She pays about 30% of the rent because that's all she can afford.

My roommate has one particularly good friend who she invites over regularly. I do not like that woman at all. She is loud, self-centered, and has no concept of boundaries, property, or privacy. She has ""accidentally"" eaten my food and drunk my beer several times when she came over, and I have voiced my opinion about her to my roommate regularly. My roommate's response has always been ""as long as I'm paying my part of the rent, the company I keep is between them and me."" 

On Saturday night, she invited her friend over. As I often am in my room, I was completely naked, lying over my covers, reading a book. I like being naked and expect a reasonable amount of privacy from civilized people. 

When my roommate was in the bathroom, my door door flew open like it was rammed by a siege engine. Her friend had barged in to ""surprise"" me, and instead of frantically apologizing for violating my privacy (and seeing me naked), she burst out laughing as I fumbled to cover myself. By now my roommate had come out of the bathroom, and her friend shouted to her ""I saw his little ____!"" My roommate snort-laughed loudly.

The next morning my roommate was hung over, and so I told her that her time in the house was over and that she had a month to vacate. I looked up the laws in my state, and since I am the only person on the lease, I can legally kick her out as long as I give her proper notice. She told me that she warned her roommate about privacy after what happened, and I told her I don't care at all. She brought that woman into the house, she was entertained by my embarrassment, and I wasn't comfortable living with her for another day. I told her if it were legal I'd kick her out that second.

My roommate has been nasty with me all week, saying that she has nowhere to go. I don't care and keep telling her that she might want to start looking. Our mutual friend who I originally did the favor for has sided with her completely, and so I just blocked him.

AITA for not replacing my sisters $3000 gaming laptop after my child spilled juice on it because it was on the floor?,20521,Not the A-hole,5065,d24zdo,1568135306.0,"Title is pretty self explanatory. But basically over the weekend, I had a work trip to go on so my sister offered to babysit my 2 year old. She’s babysat him a few times so knows what to expect. Well, this time, she left her $3000 gaming laptop *on the floor* of her lounge room. She gave my son an open cup of apple juice without supervision, and he decided to use the laptop as a table on the floor. Things happen and somehow it got knocked over.

Her laptop no longer switches on. She’s blaming me and expects me to buy her a new one. I told her no as it shouldn’t have been in his reach and certainly not on the floor. She’s refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she’ll never babysit for me ever again. I really don’t feel as though it’s my responsibility.. AITA?

EDIT: Yikes this blew up. A few people have asked for more info. Yes, I packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. I supplied everything he’d need for the weekend - including nappies and food. My parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she’d be able to spend time with him. It wasn’t just ‘babysitting’ but more enjoying time with her nephew. I gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as ‘payment’ for watching my son.

UPDATE: AITA for not wanting a relationship with my parents now they've cut me off?,20519,UPDATE,1001,g96gsd,1588041221.0,"Recap on [my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g06g8u/aita_for_not_wanting_a_relationship_with_my/):  My parents cut me off financially with 10 days notice and BS reasoning. They had offered to pay my rent throughout university so I had 10 days to find a new place to live. I ended up sleeping on my friend's sofa. About 6 weeks of no contact later, they called me asking why I hadn't called to wish my mum a happy birthday. I wanted to know if I was TA for not wanting anything to do with them given the way they cut me off. It later came out that the reason they cut me off is that my older brothers told them I'm a lesbian (which... I might be. Still figuring that out. But my brothers didn't know that). I sent my parents proof my brothers lied and they apologised but I've not forgiven them and probably won't ever. I'd applied for emergency housing and a full student finance loan but as I couldn't prove my parents cut me off the services I had to go through said they couldn't help me. I was also looking into a work placement as my course offers them and they pay a decent amount.

So here's how everything has shaped up:

* I won't be getting emergency housing from uni. I've not heard anything and there's less than a month left before summer, so I'd be shocked if I got it at this stage.
* I'm still living with my friend. She got me a job at her workplace but refuses to take any rent off me so I've been repaying her by sneakily buying food and cooking her dinner as I get home before her. We have plans to move in together this summer ready for next year.
* My parents have done a complete 180 and now want me to forgive them so badly that they're still refusing to sign a letter showing they've cut me off, so I'm still fucked with student finance. My parents have also offered me my truck back, so me, my roommate, and 2 more friends will be going to my parents' house some time soon to collect my truck and some things from my room. My tutor has written a letter for me for student finance which they might accept but I'm waiting to hear back.
* My course changes were approved so now I'm doing what I want, not what my parents want, and it looks like I got my work placement, so I'll be either working and studying part time for 2 years or working all next year and finishing studies the year after. Either way I'll be adding an extra year to my course but I get paid and get relevant experience in my field.

Ultimately, everything seems to have worked out as well as it could. Thanks to everyone who commented because a lot of you had great advice and thought of stuff I didn't, and I was truly concerned that I was in the wrong so thanks for the reassurance, too. I will also be booking a session with the on campus mental health professional because this has really shone a light on just how fucked up my family is.

AITA? I cut somebody's water off as they were wasting it,20457,Not the A-hole,1310,gktkkv,1589659478.0,"30 years ago my grandfather dug a well. It supplies our home and has a pump to supply water to a mini water tower thing to give our homes water pressure.

Another person built a house nearby and there was an agreement for them to plumb into our fresh water supply for limited domestic use: Cooking, cleaning, toilets etc. This agreement has stood for 10 years without any problems.

So what's been going wrong? 

The house next door was sold.

It's now starting to get hot. So the next door neighbour has been filling a swimming pool. I don't see a problem with this. What I do see a problem is they fill the pool and drain it EVERY SINGLE DAY.

Based on my calculations they're wasting close to 400,000 litres of water every single day. 

When I told them they can't waste water like this. They told me to f*** myself because the water is free and nobody owns it.

So I gave them a warning showing that the water supply belonged to us and it wasn't free at all. I was told to f*** off again. I watched as they filled their pool again AND drained it again. 

I simply turned off their turned off the valve supplying their home which is on our land. They now have no water whatsoever as they tried to fill their pool again this morning.

They're now complaining and whining about not having any water. I told them they can get a tanker to come and fill their pool and supply them.

"AITA For walking out on a double date my friend set up with him, his girlfriend and a girl I had already rejected before",20547,Not the A-hole,1387,hgr9s6,1593282824.0,"I feel like I need to say this for this post not to be removed, this is not about the date, about relationships or something I want a judgement on me walking out of there.

Cast: Me (25M), Joe(26M), Jane(24F)

To give you a little background to this situation, I met Jane through Joe's girlfriend at her birthday party last year. At first Jane was fun to talk to but not even an hour later Jane was really in to me and tried really badly to hit on me during the party, which pretty much ruined my time there as the feeling was not mutual in the slightest bit also at the time I was already with someone. So the first impression I got from Jane was that she was clingy, annoying and just wouldn't stop bothering me.

Unfortunately for me she became part of my larger friend group because she is part of Joe's girlfriends friend group(That is a mouthful sheesh) and because me and Joe hang out a lot and I am also friends with his girlfriend, I pretty much run in to her at minimum twice a month.

So first time Jane asked me out was a month after that party, I informed her I was with someone and not interested, she tried again a 2 months later when I broke up with my then girlfriend, again I declined her advances and told her I was not interested. I got in to a new relationship not long after but unfortunately she and I broke up about 2 months ago. Since then as you might have anticipated, Jane has asked me out again, I said no again.

Well that brings us to this week, everything has been opening up here and Joe had been trying to fix me up with a friend of his girlfriend and would not tell me who(He is well aware of me having rejected Jane multiple times and the fact I am not interested in her, he knows this in detail.) After a lot of what he calls convincing and I call whining(I had no interest in dating anytime soon) I relented and decided to agree to this double date idea of his.

We agree on meeting at Joe's apartment and lo and behold Joe, His girlfriend and Jane are occupying  the dinner table obviously intending for my date to be Jane, I honestly just got so goddamn angry I that I couldn't even get a single word out, turned around and left.

I have been bombarded with texts and calls about how much of a douche I am and how terribly I hurt Jane and so on and I am just like, I literally rejected her like three times, I am not interested in her, you knew that, your girlfriend knew that, our entire friend group has a running joke about obsessive Jane FFS so literally everyone knows it.

"Update: AITA for getting angry at being told ""I'm not a parent""?",20433,UPDATE,352,gpsuep,1590367384.0,"Original post here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/f6kdpy/aita\_for\_getting\_angry\_at\_being\_told\_im\_not\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/f6kdpy/aita_for_getting_angry_at_being_told_im_not_a/)

Well, it's been a long several months, and a lot has happened, so I thought I'd give Reddit an update.

There were a lot of NTA's and NAH's on the last post, but a lot of ""you're not their parent""'s as well. A mixed field, but a fair assessment.

For the record, I did not attend the show, but was delighted by the pictures. After, as many of you lovely redditors pointed out, the best thing to do was to talk to A. We'd been best friends for over a decade. I'm happy to report, we continue to be. I'll give the short of the situation.

A and I spoke, a lot. It started with little steps, but we got to the big issues: our link, my link with the kids, her new partner, the whole deal. Little by little, we got things set straight, and where we both sit on them. As some of you rightly guessed, there was a lot to untangle, but fifteen years of friendship saw us through. The next phase was talking to the kids. First A, then us together. I'd already gone back to seeing them, and as I mentioned before, their welfare has always been the priority. Surprisingly, the conversation was more straight-forward than it had been with A. Somewhere in the middle, we also spoke (there was a lot of speaking) with A's partner (who I will be calling B). The beginning wasn't the smoothest, but we got there.

Here's what came out of it. The truth of the matter is, I'm not the twins' biological father, but what we realised was that somewhere in the past twelve years of sharing our lives, and despite trying so hard not to overstep boundaries, I fell into the role. I can't separate myself, and they don't want me to. So slowly, we've been working on what this new, unconventional normality looks like. B has been a surprising godsend in all of this - I really think A's found a good guy. I'm still mostly called by my nickname, but the slips have gone uncorrected. In the meantime, B's gotten his own moniker.

A little way down the line in all of this, Covid-19 became a thing, so we decided to take a big jump - I moved in, for the duration of quarantine - it was easier than moving their whole household into my flat. No better way to put an arrangement to the test. I'm back to my university days of sleeping on the couch, working at the kitchen table, and cooking every dinner. I've stopped not one, but two doomed attempts at self-dyeing hair, and had a conversation with one twin about taking my surname when he's older (he thinks it makes his name sound cooler, I've said that we'll ask his mum).

So Reddit, I hope that this can bring a bit of joy to the AITA community. It's not easy, we're adjusting, and we know that this will remain unconventional. However, the kids are happy, and we adults are too.

PS: To the redditor who named me as the ""Intercontinental-Super-Uncle-Warbucks"": when this is all over, I'm getting that on a mug.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the well wishes! I'm glad to have been able to share this lovely update with you all.

Edit II: A lot of you lovely folks have inquired about adoption. In the UK, there is no option to adopt someone you are not related to unless you a. Apply for an Adoption Order, which would sever the link with the living parent or b. Are the partner of their living parent. As can be seen, neither would work for our case. However, we figured out a system a long time ago, and it includes what to do if anything were to befall A - the kids' safety is always ensured, I promise. ",False,1590366146.0,2020-05-24 17:43:04
UPDATE - AITA for wanting to send my teen daughter to a weight loss camp?,20389,UPDATE,543,g49inc,1587338951.0,"[Original post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dxprju/aita_for_wanting_to_send_my_teen_daughter_to_a/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Hey Reddit.
So, my ex wouldn't even consider sending our daughter to get treatment for her eating disorder. We missed the sign up deadline and my daughter had moved in with her dad full time thanks to his encouragement. He was loving his role of the good parent, and I lost it when my daughter told me that she had stopped talking to her therapist. 

Desperate, I filed for sole legal custody and a change of housing arrangements in my favor. My ex was upset that I did it without notifying him first and my daughter refused to talk to me at all. I was exhausted so I started therapy alone. My therapist told me to write a letter to my daughter and that's exactly what I did. 4 days later she agreed to meet me.

We didn't talk much at first but she was happy that I started therapy. She told me that she misses her therapist but her dad told her that she doesn't need therapy because she's fine. She also said she misses me but she wasn't ready to move back in with me because of how controlling and restrictive I am. 

2 days later I asked her to go grocery shopping with me and I had set aside $50 for her to choose the groceries she wants to buy for our home, in case she comes back and to show her I was ready to change. In the meantime, my ex got served and my daughter and I went through another period of very little contact because of it. Mid February, she decided to move back in with me if I put the legal actions on hold. This was a smart tactic on her dad's behalf, I'll admit, but she was finally back with me so I decided to focus on that. I realized that I made the mistake of competing with my ex so many times when I should've focused on my daughter instead.

It's been over 2 months and my daughter hasn't spent a single full day at her dad's place. They hang out but she chooses not to spend extended periods of time at his house. She's been seeing her therapist since moving back in and she's in a better place now. It took losing her for me to realize that I needed to change too in order to improve our relationship. I learned to relax more and stop being so tense and constantly moving, and she is starting to understand that I'm doing all I can in her favor. 

She's decided that she wants to lose weight (23lbs down) and is hoping to improve her health before college. We have snacks, pizza night and we bake a dessert together every weekend. Those things I would never allow before, but we're both learning balance. She still doesn't like to exercise but we do go on late night walks around the block and she's doing more chores.

Our relationship has never been this genuine. We have a long way ahead and I'm preparing for the low points that are bound to happen, especially with her dad, but I'm appreciating what we have now.

Edit: Just a quick edit to say thank you for all of your kind, supportive and informative comments, I appreciate it. I apologize if I don't respond to everyone.

Edit2: She follows the approach of intuitive eating combined with balanced meals that don't deprive her of any food type. This way, she's learning the concept of balance and abandoning the concept of food as a coping mechanism or a punishing tool. 

As far as physical activity goes, I'll definitely talk to her and see if she likes any of the recommendations you have given. While I agree that weight loss can be achieved even without physical activity, I think that abandoning her sedentary lifestyle step by step (literally) is another way of getting healthier since weight loss isn't a primary goal.

I don't have much else to say about her dad other than the fact that I've just recently, with the help of my therapist, realized that he's a classic Disney dad. I know some of you think it's wrong of me to take him to court, but I would stop at nothing to help my kid. I wasn't going to sit back and let him baby her into death and self loathing while removing her from my life.

AITA for telling my pregnant and disabled sister that she needs to move out before baby comes?,20374,Not the A-hole,2154,ftd115,1585819202.0,"So I feel terrible and guilty but I also feel like I have no choice. Looking for advice and unbiased judgment.

I have a younger sister (26) who’s disabled. I won’t get into it but she’s unable to work a full time job and is on disability, which isn’t much. She’s been living with me for ~3 years. I pay for nearly everything including groceries but she chips in for utilities or takeout once in a while. 

Last year she started dating a guy and got very serious very quickly. He’s underemployed with social anxiety and lives off of a little money his parents send him each month. He also moved in with us a few months back. I live in a larger house so didn’t mind 2 more people at the time. 

Two weeks ago my sister told me she was pregnant. I was shocked. She said she’s around 1.5 months along and they’re excited to be parents. I didn’t know how to react and sat on it for a few days before approaching both of them and saying that I can’t have them raising a baby in my home. 

I basically support both of them at this stage, letting them use their own money (again, not much) for leisure things like movies or video games. I asked them how they plan on paying for a baby and they didn’t think it was a big deal. I imagine if the baby comes I’ll probably end up paying for all 3 of them. 

In the end I told both of them that they can stay with me until the baby comes, but I don’t want a baby in my home and the huge amount of responsibility that will probably fall to me. My sister cried and her bf accused me of being two faced, because they have nowhere else to go. I offered to help them pay rent for the first few months and budget for them but they’re resistant. My sister is now saying I’m essentially forcing them to give up their baby by kicking them out. I feel bad but I feel like if this keeps going I’ll be supporting an entire family on my own for who knows how long. AITA?",False,False,2020-04-02 02:20:02
"AITA for telling a coworker I was going to ""make a baby"" and name it a name she wants?",20325,Not the A-hole,1930,dwgbbx,1573796380.0,"This is the dumbest argument I've ever been involved in, and definitely the most absurd work conversation, too.

I have a friend, ""Julie"", who has just come back from maternity leave. She and I work on neighbouring desks, and the setup is that the longest part of our desks are against each other in a way that leaves us effectively sitting on opposite sides of one large desk. We were on lunch break, eating at our desks, and Julie asks me about when my husband and I are planning on having kids.

I reply ""it's in the works, hopefully within the next year. Definitely sooner rather than later""

Then another coworker, who sits on the next set of desks over, hears us talking. Her name is ""Anna"" and I'll admit that Julie and I don't really like her, and try and avoid conversations with her in general.

Anna interrupts us and says ""Hubby and I are working on having a baby right now.""

Julie says ""that's lovely.""

Anna then says something about hardly being able to wait for baby ""Joseph"".

I say ""that's a lovely name, my father is called Joseph.""

Anna then says in a light tone, but there's clearly some venom to it, ""don't you go stealing my name now"" and laughs.

I'm a bit taken aback by this, tbh. I'm not offended but it's just a bit like '... ohhhkay, never mentioned it but... sure', and it's really confusing to me because I know about a dozen Josephs, it's not exactly a unique name or something anyone could ""steal"".

Julie tries to change the subject, but there's 2 more occasions during the rest of the work day where Anna just sort of says something to me about not ""stealing her name"", both times in the same jokey but menacing tone. At this stage she's getting on my nerves.

And then Anna says right as we're leaving ""promise me you'll wait until after me so I get Joseph"", and as she says it she laughs like it's a really funny joke. Julie and I give each other a look that says we really do not get this joke and I realise that she's said I should wait until after she gets pregnant for me to get pregnant in case I ""steal"" the name Joseph.

We all head off, the three of us end up in the lift together, and Julie asks about my plans for tonight. I say, totally deadpan, ""going to make a baby. The name Joseph is so rare I'm worried someone is going to steal it if I'm not quick enough"" and Julie and I both burst out laughing.

Anna is really really offended. Cannot stress enough how livid she was after hearing me say that. Julie and I both think it's really funny but I told my sister and she says that while it was funny, I was kind of a bitch about the whole thing. I am now doubting how funny it actually was.

Am I TA?

&#x200B;

Backstory because people are asking: Anna was fine when she first started working here a couple years ago, but she was a little too ""by the book"" and got a bit email-happy with HR early on, and would send emails roughly weekly, CCing in whoever it was about, reporting Coworker X for saying she was going to vote on her way home (not allowed to talk about politics) and Coworker Y saying he was going to his niece's confirmation (not allowed to talk about religion) and stuff like that. We all just collectively stopped talking to her so she no longer had ammo for HR. She eased up around the 3 or 4 month mark when she realised it was making her pretty unpopular, but people were still cautious around her. Me, Julie, Anna and a couple other guys who work in different parts of the office are the only people still here who were here for that, and we're still cautious around her even though she hasn't emailed HR in a while. Anna has previously tried to befriend us and she's apologised for her actions in the past, but we still aren't her biggest fans. Anna's desk has the same set up as ours but she doesn't have a desk-mate because hers retired a few months ago and they haven't replaced her yet, and since then Anna has been trying to talk to us over lunch or while we're working. We've tried to keep it professional, asking if she has a certain form or if she got my (work related) email, or stuff like that, but she wants to talk about outside of work and generally get to know us. We're cautious about this because of what happened when she started working here.

&#x200B;

Also I know I could have said ""I'm not naming my child Joseph"" and been done with it but first off I'm not going to promise not to use it for the sake of a coworker I don't get on with and also it is in the running, as a middle name, along with a few other options, in the 50% possibility that I get pregnant with a boy.",False,1573825133.0,2019-11-14 21:39:40

AITA for choosing my biological child over my foster son?,20280,Asshole,6891,dhrtpz,1571094318.0,"My husband and I never thought that we could get pregnant, so we got plenty of therapy after a few failed treatments and moved to fostering with the intent to adopt. We've had a few fosters, but this concerns our current foster, a 9 year old who's been with us for two years. He's a spirited boy, but not a bad kid. Just takes a lot of time, money, and mental energy. 

The child's case plan has now moved to adoption, and we were identified as an adoptive resource. We were taking the first steps towards adoption when we found out that I was pregnant. It was mind-blowing as this is my first pregnancy, and I am now over 40. I had thought I had finally hit menopause, but was in fact 12 weeks pregnant. 

Unfortunately, after thinking we could do both, we did the hard math, and with our work and our finances, the only way we could raise our foster son is if we terminate this pregnancy. We can't financially have both children. I can't emotionally bring myself to terminate what is realistically our only chance at a biological child, who I am already bonding with. My husband wouldn't think of it either. We have to refuse the adoption. 

Unfortunately still, our foster son knows of preparations for an adoption through his therapist and social worker, so now we're taking him away from a stable home and what may be his only chance of adoption as he is older, all for reasons that aren't his fault. Am I the asshole for putting a still unborn child above him?

Edit: 

Baby:
Baby has passed prenatal testing with flying colors.

Finances:

We currently live in a 2 bedroom condo. We are required to give foster son his own room, which is not possible with a baby by social services standards. Us moving into the living room doesn't pass either. Social services is giving us until January to find a larger place, but we would have to stay in the county. We can't afford 3 bedroom places in the county, as it's a costly area.

We don't qualify for assistance with both of us working, and if one of us quits, we wouldn't be able to afford our current place even with the assistance we could get. Both of us working would make it difficult to swing appointments for two children as well. It's a catch 22 basically.",True,1571067559.0,2019-10-14 16:05:18

What’s worse is he’s a gym teacher, so his female students (some of whom are my classmates) are exposed to his nasty ass attitude. 

Last night, my brother went on another long rant about the latest girl who managed to resist his ‘nice guy charm.’ He kept going on about it, and I got annoyed because of it. I told him, ‘Maybe if you weren’t such a piss baby someone would want to date you.’ (Piss baby was said because my parents have forbidden the term incel in our house. Because my brother gets upset over it. Also, it was the first thing I could come up with other than incel)

Surprise, my brother gets upset about it. My dad tells me to apologize to my brother, and I tell him I wasn’t going to apologize to a nasty ass piss baby who goes around treating people (mainly women) like shit just because he’s a ‘nice guy.’ Things escalate to where my dad, brother and I are all screaming at each other at the dinner table.

UPDATE: AITA for snapping at my brother because he’s the reason we moved?,20170,UPDATE,1116,gn4gy2,1589976960.0,"Hello Reddit. Before I begin, I’d like to thank everyone for how supportive they have been in response to [my last post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/fwv5rx/aita_for_snapping_at_my_brother_because_hes_why/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I’ve gotten a lot of PM’s about helping me with debate, and advice, which is greatly appreciated. I haven’t really gotten a chance to give y’all an update, and you’ll see why. 

So as background, my uncle Randy (not real name of course), doesn’t have kids, but he’s dating my aunt Rebecca (technically girlfriend, but it’s been 8 years, so she’s family). They live across the country in City Z, which is a great place, not as nice as City X for debate, but definitely better than City Y. Since they live pretty far away, we only really see them on holidays, the years we spend it with dad’s family. 

Randy is very well-off, I don’t know how much he makes exactly, but I’ve stayed at his house & it’s very nice for a place in City Z. And it’s not his only one. He’s very generous, and he has set up college funds for me, Daniel, and Rebecca’s little brother (Ricky). I’d still rather get a scholarship than use Randy’s money, because I don’t want to be a burden. Ricky is younger than me, so sometimes I tutor him over the phone, we’re pretty close. I also talk to my uncle fairly frequently, we talk about politics together. However, he doesn’t really speak to/like Daniel, because he’s rude to Rebecca. 

Anyways, I was helping Ricky with his math homework shortly after my original post, when I just started to cry. I don’t really know what came over me, but I haven’t told anyone about how upset I was before then, because there’s so much else going on in the world. Ricky and I talked, and I found out that my parents actually told the entire family the reason we were moving was because City Y had a better debate circuit & they believed it because no one else does debate. I hadn’t discussed the move with them, because I bottle my emotions, and they didn’t really ask me about the move because they assumed I wanted it. 

I ended up talking to my uncle about it, and we had a really great conversation about it. He’s extremely angry at my parents, and Daniel. This was the second to last straw for him, and he ended up removing half of Daniel’s college fund & split it into me & Ricky’s funds. Daniel was very upset, because he’d been relying on that money and our parents hadn’t saved up. So he threw my phone down the stairs. Then I emailed my uncle from my laptop, and he revoked the rest of Daniel’s college fund too. My parents are quite angry at me too, because it’s not like they can come up with $200k by the time Daniel goes to college. My uncle has offered for me to come stay with them in City Z, which I have taken him up on. He also generously bought me a new phone, which I’m writing this post with right now.

Edit: I’ve gotten A LOT of messages, and I can’t really answer them all, so I’ll just address the most common questions. 

What did your brother do? Posted a racist snapchat rant on his public story instead of private, I don’t want to go too into detail besides that. 

Is [insert video of racist kid] your brother? Either way, I’m not going to confirm or deny it. However, I’m really impressed at the variety of racist kids vaguely fitting Daniel’s description you guys have managed to find. 

Have your parents agreed to you moving in with your uncle? Short answer yes. Long answer — took a lot of pressure from other family members, but they conceded. I’ll be with them on holidays.

My husband and I are looking to upgrade homes given we're planning on expanding our family, so we've been looking at a few open houses recently. About a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. Super bright, very loud, apparently VERY fragile and pretty much right out in the open. When I saw her touching it I told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle.

AITA for refusing my mother's dying wish,20109,Not the A-hole,2355,fxsho6,1586467991.0,"33F, married, financially stable and happy with a couple cats and a senior dog

My mother (67 F) is a cancer survivor and was recently diagnosed with another, more aggressive form of tumor. Considering her history with treatment, the prognosis isn't good. 

She and I aren't close. She has untreated mental health issues (I suspect BPD) that made my life hell growing up, and even in my adult years she's often tried to control my life to make it more like hers. One thing we've always disagreed on is the topic of babies. My mother *loves* babies (but not children, who have opinions) and has desperately wanted to be a grandmother from the moment she found out she was having a daughter. Unfortunately for her, I'm childfree. I like kids. I even work with babies, and I'm good with them. But I've never wanted one, and I'm an only child.

I called her after the diagnosis came in to check on her, and - in tears - she declared that now is the time that I *have* to give her a grandbaby. The doctor is giving her about a year to live, perfect timing if I get pregnant now apparently. She says this is the only thing that would make her feel better about dying.

As usual, I said no. I don't want a kid. My spouse doesn't want a kid. That's it.

Now, several of my mother's friends, who in the past had supported my decision, are calling me up to say I'm TA for refusing her dying wish. They're pointing out that my spouse and I could afford a child (true) and that we already have more space in our home than we need (sort of true), and therefore the only thing that's stopping me from popping out an infant in 9 months is, in their opinion, that I'm a horrible selfish child.

To be clear, I'm not going to change my mind. A lot of factors have gone into my decision not to have babies, and a few old people calling me a self-absorbed bitch won't change that, but I'll admit that perhaps I am, in fact, a self-absorbed bitch.

Early on I noticed she was stressed, she was working from early to late (I had noticed she was getting home at like 10pm-11pm) 

I started to ""accidentally"" cook extra, I'd bring over Sheppard pies, meat pies, fish pie etc, I'd ""accidentally"" have too many steaks or food that was about to go off and this led to the children just having dinner at ours.


We recently discovered our daughter (3F) has a meat allergy so everything has been swapped to a veggie option, me and my partner have decided it will make life a whole lot easier to make the switch with her - to put it bluntly, I'm not cooking two meals.

We usually avoid soya and just do vegetables, vegetable lasagne, mushroom burgers etc, broccoli and kale mac n cheese.

Well neighbour decided to complain that I was trying to ""convert"" her children who now refuse to eat food she cooks.

So, I've stopped cooking for her.

She apologized and has asked me to cook but she's never appreciated what I've done for her and complaining has just pushed it all over the edge.

My husband thinks I'm being an AH and that she was just being a concerned parent and clearly feels bad about accepting my charity.

AITA For making my little sister walk home.,20070,Not the A-hole,3097,dom0df,1572359566.0,"So recently I got my license and my dad thought it would be a good idea for me to drive my little sister home. She would normally walk speaking she falls right under the 1.5 mile rule our school system implemented. The first few days went fine but then she unplugged my phone from the aux cord and started blasting her music. I took notice by not moving and giving her a funny look. She replied with a snarky what and I asked her why she unplugged my phone. She responds with ""I got tired of listening to your music"". I told her that if she wants a ride home she'll have to listen to my music. I then unplugged her phone and started driving. Then she gets bold and while I'm driving unplugs my phone and starts playing her music again. So I pullover and tell her to get out. She kinda sat there and looked confused but after repeating myself a few times she hopped out. I wasn't expecting the backlash from my stepmom when I got home. She was pissed and ""threatened"" me with calling my dad and telling him about my reckless behavior. She went on to call me an ego maniac and other names. When my dad got home it started a argument between them because he thinks I was justified. From my POV she's a 7th grader that should understand that her actions have consequences. I understand it is a little thing but I gave her a warning and she didn't respect it.

AITA for keeping my grandmothers ring when it was given to me by “mistake”?,20023,Not the A-hole,1488,d0lpvl,1567828712.0,"My grandmother passed earlier this year and she had a pretty nice jewelry collection. Before she passed she knew what went to who and had had me meet to see what I’d like. Instead of jewelry I asked for her wedding dress. No one else wanted it, I had gotten married in it, and she was really touched. After talking to her kids she went ahead and gave it to me before passing. 

When she did pass away I was surprised she hadn’t written down who got what pieces. Since I had already passed on inheritance of a piece I didn’t go to the meeting with the rest of the family. Basically they sat down and went oldest to youngest and let each person pick until there were no pieces. From what I heard it was peaceful and everyone was happy. 

Since I wasn’t there they still wanted me to have something and picked a ring they thought had fake diamonds. It was the biggest and they assumed it was a diamond substitute. It was sweet of them to do that, so I could have a piece of her everyday too. 

When I got the ring I didn’t examine it. It was big enough I thought it was fake too. But then I saw a diamond on the inside band (indicating Leo diamonds). I took it to get it evaluated and it has real diamonds. It’s value is about 5k more than her next expensive piece (they had the papers on all of those). Essentially I got a nicer and more expensive piece than even her oldest daughter. But they chose it for me. 

Now, they want to redo the distribution. But I feel like it’s fair. I didn’t ask for anything, they gave me something anyways, now they realize the value of it and want it back. AITA if I refuse?

AITA for letting my sons girlfriend sleep in his room,19996,Not the A-hole,545,g1js19,1586948598.0,"So I’m a single dad of my 19 year old son. He’s been dating a girl from his college since the beginning of freshman year, and when he came back she asked if she could stay with me instead of her parents. I thought about it pretty deeply because I didn’t really know how I felt about it at first, but I have a lot of extra space and I figured if I said no they’d try and see each other anyway despite the stay at home orders. I’ve been treating it as close to a regular roommate situation as I can, although he is my son so it’s not quite the same, but my house is big enough that they can keep to themselves without bothering me.

And not that I’ve been trying to listen to their conversations, but from what I’ve heard they’re very good for each other. They’re always very happy and nice to each other and there doesn’t seem to be any conflicts.

Anyway when she first moved in her parents had a meltdown, they called me and demanded I kick her out and make her go home. I told them I wasn’t going to do that and if she wants to leave she’s free to. She has her own car and it’s only a 45 minute drive to her home town. They berated me over the phone a few times and then finally gave in and let her stay. 

Apparently she let it slip over video chat that they’ve been sleeping in the same room(I don’t really know what her parents expected when she moved in with him... but ok) and they called me again and demanded I separate them. I told them that again if she wants to leave I’m not keeping her, she has the means to go home, it’s not like I’ve locked them in the same room. And there’s a third spare bedroom that she can stay in if she decides she for some reason does want to be separated. 

They said that I know what they’re doing in there and that it’s a tragedy that I’m endorsing it. From my point of view is they’re both the same age, technically adults, they can serve in the military, I’m sure whatever they do in there they were doing at college. They’re old enough to decide for themselves what they want to do.

I grew up as a fat kid however when I started college and moved to a very fitness friendly state (CO) I lost alot of weight. I started to care more about my looks. I became a personal trainer last year and got a rhinoplasty recently to fix my crooked humped nose. My sister decided to move up with me. My sister was not very approving of my weight loss nor was she happy I did alot to change my appereance. While we get along wonderfully most of the time we still have fights about her thinking I'm vain. My sisters weight is around 300lb, I have offered her help however she just tells me life isnt about looks. Frankly I dont care what she looks like I just want her to be healthy and confident.

My sister sometimes acts out at me alot especially when it comes to guys. When we have gone to bars people can be cruel saying ""what youre sisters couldnt tell"" or outwardly paying more attention to me. I defend her when I see it but it still hurts her confidence she has cried to me multiple times about dating asking why cant anyone accpet her for who she is. In Jan my boyfriend of 2 yrs cheated on me. My sister told me that maybe he left me because I was too vain and high maitinence. I ignored her. Around the time of the break up she started dating a guy, and I was happy for her. However the guy gave off some weird vibes, the way he looked at my sister when she ate and making plans when my sister and I are supposed to do healthy activities. Since then my sister has gained a massive amount of weight and has become more hostile towards me. Her boyfriend buys her large quantities of unhealthy food and insists that she needs to eat more, he is weirdly touchy with her and often dismisses things she says.

AITA for pointing out that my co-worker is trans/doesn't pass?,19965,Not the A-hole,762,do75t3,1572288540.0,"Alright.

I'm a European woman in her mid-twenties who recently moved to San Francisco for a fancy-pants internship. It was a huge culture shock, but in a way, a welcome one- I'm gay (the very girly type people don't really clock as gay, but still) and this is the first time I've ever been out at work.

There is one co-worker who we shall call Linda. She's a trans woman (MtF).

Linda's position means that me and she and I don't really interact at work often. Therefore, I was told about her before I met her. One of my co-workers told me that she existed, I was due to meet her next week, and that she was a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns. I met Linda, didn't even ask for her pronouns and just used she/her, everything went alright, I thought that was the end of it.

Now, Linda does not pass as a cis woman.  She's still a woman and I'd never misgender her, but it is objectively visible that this is probably a trans woman, not a cis one.

This now caused an issue. A few of us had a Halloween get-together and invited Linda. At some point, she and I were alone at our table. We got talking about what it was like for me being this very girly gay woman in a male-dominated field in a conservative European country. At some point, I made a remark along the lines of 'but of course, you as a trans woman probably faced similar experiences'.

Her face just fell. She started hissing at me about how dare I presume she's trans, she hasn't been misgendered (I did NOT misgender her, at no point did I use 'he' or anything like that- I just said she was trans, which...she is) in years, and no one at work has ever had to ask for her pronouns etc. Drunk idiot I was, I blurted out 'but...we all know?' Which we do.

I was extremely confused. Apparently, out of the younger group of co-workers, no one ever actually asked her for her pronouns or gender identity because we all, just like me, got told by some colleague who'd been there longer that this was a trans woman who uses female pronouns. This somehow led Linda to believe that we didn't 'clock' her, which was a huge source of self-esteem for her.

Linda now, and I say this without a hint of exaggeration, hates my guts. She confided to another coworker that she's extremely hurt by me pointing out that she doesn't pass and that it was invasive and rude and how dare I judge her. I, on the other hand, don't really know what the hell happened here. She is trans, that is a fact of life, everyone knows and it is clearly visible.

AITA for making a complaint against a nursery worker due to how she reacted to my wife picking our kid up?,19964,Not the A-hole,1574,gugl7y,1591027848.0,"My wife (36) and I (37M) have 2 kids, a daughter (8) and a son (3). My wife is an essential worker as she’s a doctor. She works extremely long hours with hardly any days off whilst I work a typical 9-5 job so I’ve always taken care of arranging the kids for school and care etc.

Well with lockdown, I’ve been able to homeschool my daughter but since my wife is an essential worker, my sons nursery has still been able to take him in so I have dropped him off there as normal as even though I’m homeschooling my other kid, I’m fitting that around me working from home. It makes it easier for my son to still have his routine and so I can do my work and so on.

Anyway, I was going to pick him up like normal but my wife chose to do it as she was off at that time and could actually get him. The people at this nursery know my wife as do the parents even though she’s rarely there. She was actually happy to be able to pick our son up from nursery for once and I thought it went fine until she came home in tears.

She told me this nursery worker who has just started there didn’t believe that my wife was our sons mother as this worker had only ever seen me. The other workers and my son told her that my wife was in fact the mother and that she wasn’t a danger to my son. The new worker still didn’t believe it and said that she didn’t feel comfortable with letting a 3 year old go off with a random woman she’d never seen before. My wife got really upset and it in then upset my son as everybody was practically saying there was no danger as my wife was a mother. A few other parents got dragged into this and backed up the other staff and it was only through relenting that the new worker gave up but she made a really angry comment along the lines of, “maybe if you were here more often, I wouldn’t have to verify your identity.”

My wife wants to forget it happened but I am very angry so the next day I picked up my son and asked to speak the woman in charge about the new worker. She wasn’t there when it happened but I complained and said that how my wife was treated was ridiculous and that the coworker was out of line for her snide comment at the end. The woman wasn’t happy and I’ve now learnt the new worker has been given a severe warning and that her behaviour is being watched.

The parents who backed my wife up are torn. Some think I did the right thing as the woman didn’t act professional whilst others think I’m an Ah for interfering. My wife is annoyed as she thinks I shouldn’t have said anything. I really don’t know if what I did was right or wrong so am I the AH?",False,1591024243.0,2020-06-01 09:10:48

Edit: Sorry I can't keep up with the comments anymore!

I love dogs. We have a rescue pittie we've had for 8+ years+ a foster.

I see an 'old' man (his words, early 60s), chatting with my neighbour. His dog has no leash. His dog peed on the side of my car! I grab a bucket+shampoo+sponge, 'n walk outside.


Neighbour: Hello OP, washing the car again? 


Me -friendly-: Actually, your mates dog just peed all over my cars door. I would apprecia-


Man: My dog? He woulnd't do that!!


Me: Sir I just watched him do it, if you look at the door you can see the pee on there, a puddle-


Man: -NO, don't accuse my dog! Everyone here has dogs! Maybe it was your own!


Me: Again, I saw him. That golden with the red collar is your dog correct? It was thát dog.


Man -Full volume-: MY DOG DID NOT PEE ON YOUR CAR! 


Me: Well I'm certain he did, no damage done yet, it still washes off. I got you some soapy water, shoulnd't take more than a few seconds.


Neighbour: [Man] just wash it off, accidents happen.


Man: I AM NOT WASHING THIS KIDS CAR, HE CAN WASH IT HIMSELF (I do not look like a kid) 


Me: Not asking you to wash my car, just his pee!


Man: [Some trash talk] I am not your servant, MY dog did not pee on your door!  -I- am NOT washing it!


Me: So that's also not him pooping in my (different) neighbours yard then? Maybe you should walk him first, thén chat.


Man: [Dog] COME HERE.  (Dragging the dog out of the yard by his collar who was still pooping, while stepping on the plants / dragging dirt over the sidewalk. Then started walking off.)


Me: Pick up that mess! dude!!


Man: **** you!!! YOU clean it up yourself!!


Me: Stop acting like such an ***!


The man walks back and while basically telling me to go **** myself, knocks over my bucket and walks away. My sponge got sand in it and was ruined.. I ended up washing my car door, neighbour got a broom 'n cleaned the sidewalk.


Later he posted a nasty topic on a neighbourhood info/watch app, he obv didnt expect me to be on there. He fabricated a story: That I am a doghater that tried to force a reumatic 'old' man to clean his entire car, while he was just walking past. He is afraid of me now blabla. Mentioned my name/info too.

I replied with screenshots of him (security cam) With his dog peeing on my car, + picked out the worst looking screenshots of him getting in my face/ knocking over my bucket, also one of him dragging his dog away by its neck that caused a big backlash. And wrote what really happened. My neighbour thinks I went too far because some of our neighbourhood people are apparently 'after' him on the app now sending nasty messages. He said I made it look worse than it was by picking those specific images, that he was just a old grumpy man having a bad day. I feel justified though, because he tried to paint me off as a horrible person and I just stated the truth. AITA?

AITA for buying my 5th property rather than help out my siblings?,19929,Not the A-hole,3811,glf7om,1589750068.0,"For context, even when I (44M) was a child I was incredibly into owning property and designing houses. I work as an architect and am doing quite well for myself. Bought my first duplex here in Germany along time ago where I rent out both part. Then I own two houses in Italy and one in Spain. Two of them are get rented out as Holiday homes while the last one I use for vacations and rent out a room to a friend of mine. So I have a lot of passive income at the moment, but only after a lot of time and money investments and refurbishing of these houses. (I rent in NYC at the moment as my job has moved made me move here temporarily).

My brother (48M) does an apartment. He has a family with two kids while my wife and I are childless. They are currently looking to purchase a house that fits all of them nicely. While they have found their dream house, its out of budget for them. Meanwhile, my wife and I are about to buy our 5th house, this time in France. It's going to be one of our largest purchases yet, significantly larger than anything else we have done. Its a great deal on the property however, and ideally what my wife and I want to retire in.

When having a family facetime with my siblings and parents, I brought it up. Initially very happy for me, my brother mentioned how he needs a larger home for his family and how I should give up on this opportunity to give him money for his house and spend the rest on refurbishing their new home. I just laughed and said flat out no. (Edit: Thought this was a joke)

This was apparently the wrong move, my entire family turns against me and starts berating me. After 10 minutes of them taking turns telling me to buy my brother a house, I said I'd think about it and left.

I am a bit of a pushover so after talking to my wife we agreed we could wait and buy their house and rent it out to them at no profit. Apparently this was insulting to him, having his younger brother be his landlord and my parents said I should just outright give him the money we have been saving.

I told em to piss off, and started moving forward with the paperwork on our house in France. After talking to my friends, they said I should put family first and its not like we are struggling for money.

Now I am confused, AITA?

AITA for saying I wont pay for my daughters education if she switches her major?,19923,Not enough info,6857,delta8,1570494450.0,"As I said in my title, last night I sat my daughter down and told her that if she switches her major I will cease her tuition payments.

My daughter is currently a freshman in college. She has just started her first semester and I'm the one paying the bill. I have been saving for over 10 years to do this and I am happy to do it, as long as I feel she is actually setting herself up for success. During high school my daughter my daughter fell in love with computers. She took ever class she could on programming and computer science and declared that her major going into school. I supported her through all this because I thought this is what she loved and felt it set her up for a good job after school.

This last week she was on fall break so she came to stay with me over the weekend after spending a few days at my ex's house. My daughter yesterday morning decided to casually drop that she's planning on changing majors. I was shocked by this and asked why and what she was changing to. She is planning on switching into the liberal arts program. Now I know the major is the go to punching bag and it feels cliche, but I was honestly a little shocked by how casually she acted about this. When I tried to get why she was switching all I got was that she all of the sudden hates computer science and has made multiple friends who are majoring in LA. Apparently she has been talking with the councilors up there as well and they along with her friends have all recommended she switch majors.

I tried to ask her the regular stuff ""what about your future"", ""How do you plan to get a job"", etc. And she decided to ignore me and tell me that it's none of my business and that she's an adult. This angered me. I'm the one paying for this I feel I have a right to know and not be blown off like that. I thought over it all day and so last night I sat her down and told her that while yes, she is an adult. I am the one paying for her education and I won't be paying for her to get what is in my opinion a worthless degree. I told her if she doesn't want to do CS that's fine. But she needs to put more thought into the change and find something that she enjoys AND can get her a career. And if in the end she decides that she's an ""adult"" and she wants to be a liberal arts major. She can pay for it like an adult should, with her own money.

This did not sit well with her. We fought and she left saying i'm trying to control her life with money and am being a major asshole. My ex called me up after and told me that I'm no better than a dictator right now and that I'm using her college fund as ransom for her to do what I want.

&#x200B;

All I want is for my daughter to have a good life and job prospects. AITA here?

Edit:

Wow, did not expect this.

I have read a good amount of the responses on here and through the people who have messaged me. Before I say anything else let me clarify my position a bit because I see the same question sent to me and I don't feel like responding to hundreds of people individually.

I do not have a problem with my daughter getting a LA degree.

If my daughter called me up now and gave me her reasons for switching and a legitimate plan for how she will use this degree to secure a career, I would support her 100%. I don't care what my daughter does with her life. I just want her to do something with her life. I am looking to spend over one hundred thousand dollars over the next 4 years. The least I feel I can ask of my daughter is to have a plan in mind before she decides to make changes on my dime. I get that young adults who go to college are using this as a avenue to find themselves and explore. And many of you have told me that I should not treat this as setting her up for a career, and instead treat this as a ""academic experience"" to teach her life lessons. For those two last points, I feel you are wrong.

This money that I have saved is not a ""gift"". This is what I have saved for 10 years to make sure that she has opportunities that me my ex never had. This is my investment in her. For people who claim that I should be throwing my money at her no questions asked and support her, I respectfully disagree. Giving my daughter money for free, in my opinion, is the worst thing I could do for her right now. Supporting her as she makes a choice she has given me no justification for that will cost me thousands of dollars will kill me. And the fact that she seems to think that I am owed no explanation and that I should ""mind my own business because she's an adult"" is an insult to the investment I am making in her.

I am not arguing whether or not I am wrong. If you all feel I am an asshole for this, then I will accept that.

&#x200B;

I called my daughter and left a message saying that I wish to talk with her about this and that I feel we left off in a bad place and wish to talk about this more. If my daughter wants to go into LA, then that is her choice. Weather or not I pay for it will be mine.",False,1570496327.0,2019-10-07 17:27:30
AITA my boyfriend wont let me get a breast reduction?,19897,Not the A-hole,1072,g5n4a3,1587530111.0,"tl;dr: i have large breasts that have caused me nothing but back pain, and my boyfriend thinks im self centered for wanting a reduction. 

For context, I (26F) was born with unfortunately large  breasts. currently my bra size is that of a whopping 38 E. Because of this, ive had INTENSE back pain, shoulder pain, etc growing up. 

Starting a few months ago, the pain had only gotten worse and worse- It seemed i couldnt go an hour without having to dramatically crack my back and swallow ibuprofen and still have to suffer pain. Ive tried yoga, stretching, exercising, and everything to try to eliminate back pain (i hoped that with a stronger core or something I'd be able to support my own chest), buy I've only found that it makes it worse.

So i did some research and found that a breast reduction was just what i needed- I thought about going down to a C cup or even a B. I wanted my back pain to be COMPLETELY gone. So, about a week ago, I brought up with my boyfriend (28M), thinking he'd take it well (he's always been supportive of me, so i trusted him) and he was PISSED. He told me that i was throwing away my body and ""caving in"" to ""societal pressure"". He said there was no reason to change my tit size, and that if i did, he wouldn't be attracted to me anymore. We argued about it for a good 2 hours before he tried to ""compromise"" with me and say he was alright with it as long as i didnt go below a D cup, because anything smaller than that was ""childish"". He also called me egotistical and self absorbed, asking me why i didnt talk to him about it sooner, or think he would care about it. I told him I didnt think he'd care so much about me changing MY body, and he stormed out of the room and has been passive aggressively ignoring me ever since, even to the extent that he wont say i love you back, or sleep in the same bed as me. 

So, Reddit, i just need to know. Am i the asshole for this?


EDIT: 😂😂😂 I was not born with large breasts, but they are a genetic thing that ive had since i was about 16!

EDIT that im sure no one will see: As of May 15, after finally deciding to professionally measure myself, i am not a 38E, but rather, a 34H. Not sure how i could have messed up to drastically 😂 Also, I dumped the boyfriend! Good riddance",True,1589577460.0,2020-04-21 21:35:11

He saw me struggle putting to put gas in my truck. He let me pay for his car insurance. He heard my concerns and my offers to help him and he did not once tell me not to worry.

Yesterday I asked him to lend me $20 because a friend invited me somewhere last minute and I didn’t have cash. He got really nervous when I asked him if I could borrow his debit card.

He checked his bank account in front of me and acted surprised. He literally shouted, “wow wow wow I have extra money!!!! Oh my god this is so awesome!!” And he played the whole I didn’t know part.

He continued to argue and I told him that I don’t care about the money I care about honesty. Why did he lie? and if he can lie so blatantly about this then he can lie (or has lied) about many things.

It took a whole day for him to finally confess that he was hiding the money from me because supposedly I was going to ask for some money if I knew. He said he felt guilty for not telling about it when he saw me struggle with money.

Today I asked him to leave the house. I called him cruel and deceitful. I told him that I don’t want to be with someone that can lie so blatantly.

By the way I’m 6 months pregnant with a very wanted and planned baby. We’ve know each other for 3 years.

Am I the as*hole for leaving him over this? 
I’m just so hurt by how easily he lied and called me crazy and paranoid. And now I’m questioning everything in our relationship. Maybe his gym sessions are time that he spends with women. I don’t know anything anymore.

***UPDATE****
I followed the advice I received here (thank you). He’s back home but staying in the guest room. He came back with a brand new baby car seat (guilt?) and he’s apologizing profusely. We’ll be taking marriage counseling.",False,1569039719.0,2019-09-20 14:49:10
AITA for not reacting well when I found out my coworker is dating my ex-husband?,19859,No A-holes here,2015,e0utnu,1574604930.0,"I (26F) was married to “Sam” (30M) for three years. He was bisexual, which I knew and accepted. We divorced a year ago, after some infidelity on his part. We have no children, and we do not speak.

I work in an admissions office, and my coworker “Andy” recently got a new boyfriend. We are not close, but I congratulated him and moved on with my day. During lunch break, I was part of a larger group conversation, and one of my other coworkers asked Andy for details.

I was shocked when he pulled up a picture of my ex-husband. I blurted something out, and everyone else basically went silent. I explained to Andy that I had been married to Sam, and that he was a serial cheater and had abused painkillers in the past (also true). I ended with saying, “...but if you want to fuck up your life, go ahead and date Sam.”

Fast forward to Thursday. Andy apparently complained about my “homophobia” to HR, and I explained the situation to our rep via email. I think the situation has resolved, but I’m not sure if I did anything wrong by warning Andy. I suppose I was trying to wreck my ex’s new relationship more than I was trying to help my coworker. Does that make me the asshole? AITA?

Edit: since people are asking, here’s a transcript of the conversation. I tried to make it as close to verbatim as possible. Sorry I wasn’t more detailed in the post.

Me, seeing the picture: “Wait, what?”

Andy: “...This is the guy I was telling you about.”

Me: “That’s my ex-husband!”

Andy: “Really? He knows where I work, and he never mentioned you.”

Me: “It’s absolutely him. And I should warn you, he’s a compulsive cheater and he pops pills. He even stole a bottle of painkillers from my mom, and I found them hidden in his truck. When we were married, he was literally doped up all the time. He’s a train wreck, but if you want to fuck up your life, go ahead and date him.”",False,1574636044.0,2019-11-24 06:15:30
WIBTA If I(24M) stopped cooking for my (24F) girlfriend?,19762,Not the A-hole,4164,g9m87x,1588105505.0,"I've been with my gf S for 4 years, living together for 2. Off the start of the relationship I knew she was a picky eater. We would go to fancy  restaurants and she would order the simplest things or the same things over and over. It seemed weird to me but I didn't really care,she can do whatever she wants. I only really realized how annoying this is when we moved in together.

Now I on the other part I'm the opposite. I like to try new foods, new tastes and get a better idea of food in general. I also love cooking and have a culinary arts degree (I wanted to become a chef but I didn't for other reasons). So you can assume that I do almost all the cooking at home. You can see where this is going.

Only when I started cooking for S did I realize how picky of an eater she is. She hates almost everything, even if she can't really taste it in the end product. To give you some examples:

She hates cinnamon.

She hates garlic.

She hates any kind of spice. (clove, nutmeg etc)

Yesterday I was making a Spanish omelet and she complained when I added the tiniest pinch of thyme in there. Because of all the ingredients I put in there she is gonna taste the pinch of thyme. 

I made a white chocolate mousse and she complained when I layerd it with oreos(!) and strawberries, because she apparently doesn't like oreos.

No amount of zest can go into our food whether that be orange or lemon zest bacsuse it apparently tastes bitter.

She hates spicy food.

She only eats steaks or whatever well done. If there's the tiniest amount of pink in there it's raw. (I've destroyed so many good steaks in the past cooking them well done).

I could go on about this she doesn't like but we'd be here all day. Last night she asked me to cook dinner but I refused. When she asked why I explained that it's frustrating to cook for a person with the tastebuds of a 5 year old, and that she can order takeout from now on.

AITA for failing a student on the last day of class?,19769,Not the A-hole,3223,e7fuwh,1575762735.0,"FINAL EDIT AT BOTTOM:
As a side gig I teach once a week for a local university. The students come to the hospital where I work and I teach them by doing direct patient care. They also have written assignments to complete, some for me in the clinical setting and some in the classroom. Most of the students I have are seniors, so college work is not new to them. 

This semester I have a student who just has a lack of motivation and puts in little effort. Her assignments are usually submitted late, but there is nothing in the syllabus that states they can’t be turned in late for full credit 🙄 The students are also allowed to redo one failed assignment for full credit. She failed her first assignment and I have reminded her throughout the term that she has to redo it because it’s a required assignment to pass the course. 

She shows up exactly on time or 2-3 minutes late for class. Their syllabus states that they must be on time for the clinical portion of class (that I teach) or they will be sent home and their absence unexcused. I have not kicked her out when she’s been 2-3 minutes late because it just seems petty. She has also missed a couple of classes that had to be made up with other clinical experiences to get her required hours. I’ve discussed this with her course professor and also with the student in her midterm evaluation. 

She missed her second to last clinical and I reminded her that she would have to complete that final assignment at her last clinical to pass. She assured me she would. I had a conversation with her classroom professor who has also been frustrated with the student this term. She had just finally turned in an assignment that was 3 weeks late. I was annoyed by that because she ended up getting the same grade as students who completed it on time. Next semester the syllabus will specify points lost for late assignments. This hasn’t historically been an issue. 

Her course professor had a conversation with her in class last week about her final clinical and that assignment absolutely having to pass or she fails the course. On the last day of clinical, all the students were there, dressed in scrubs, ready for patient rounds, on time. Except this student who walked in 3 minutes late and not dressed. I said “You are late and you are not ready. This is unprofessional. You need to leave immediately.” 

So, my making her leave means she fails the course because there is no other chance to make it up and it’s final exam week. It also means it delays her graduation by at least one semester because she will have to retake that course and can’t take a course next term that needs this one as a pre-req. At the time I felt very justified in sending her home. She’s been given several warnings and multiple breaks with late work. But now I’m feeling kind of like I might have been an asshole in kicking her out knowing it guaranteed her course failure when I’ve let her stay when she was late in the past. What do you think, Reddit?

EDIT:
I’ve had a few comments where I’ve addressed this and it should probably be added to the original post. 

I did discuss her tardiness with her several times. At the beginning of the term she was 2-3 minutes late every day. At first I said “Be careful of your time!” Then a more stern “We start on time, you need to be dressed and ready to go by the start of clinical.” But I was trying not to be a total hard ass over 2 minutes. At midterm I had to do a written evaluation of each student. I put on there that she was often tardy and needed to be on time. Those go in her file. I also filed an Academic Improvement Plan which discussed her tardiness to clinical and those failed assignments. The AIP outlines future expectations which included being on time and turning in assignments. The AIP stays in her file and goes to her academic advisor. At that time I told her she had to be on time and ready for clinical, or the next tine she would be sent home.

EDIT 2:
Holy cow, I shut my phone off for a couple of hours to go see a movie and this is exploding!! I’m trying really hard to catch up on reading everyone’s comments and answer questions. Bear with me if you posted a question, I’m trying to weave me way through this thread. 

I’ve seen a few comments and gotten a bunch of dm’s calling me a misogynistic pig. I’m a female. This student being a female had zero to do with my decision. Last term I had a male student who behaved similarly and nearly failed, but finally got his shit together and showed up on time. I don’t care what their gender is, just do your freaking work. 

And for the people saying I’m TA because why does 2-3 minutes make a difference? You clearly have no idea what rounds are like in a hospital. At the time it begins you have doctors, nurses, residents, students, possibly case managers, social workers, etc, who assemble in a group to present each patient’s case. Every one of them is ready to go. At our hospital, an overhead announcement is made 10 minutes before rounds start so that everyone gets their shit together and is ready. I’ve told my students it’s best to arrive about 10-15 min early so they can be changed in hospital scrubs and in the group ready to go. Nobody is waiting 2-3 minutes for a student to catch up. And you can be damn sure nobody is waiting 10 minutes for a student who came in late and wasn’t dressed.

FINAL EDIT: Wow, I really didn’t expect this to garner so many comments! I tried really hard to read all of them and answer the ones asking for more info. I thought it would be easiest to update the most frequently asked questions here. 

Yes, I did attempt to find out what was going on in her personal life. I’m not an ogre. I wanted to help her and would have been willing to help her in any way I could if she’d given me anything I could work with. Her tardiness was typically the result of staying out too late and sleeping as late as possible. The incomplete and late assignments were the result of failing another course and focusing more on bringing her grade up there. So I tried being flexible on both to keep her sane, which evidently was not what I should have done. 

She did not fail because she was late for class. She had a required assignment 3 months ago that she failed. She put the redo off for 3 months. The day before her final clinical practicum she was advised that it was her last chance to complete it and that she had to be on time and prepared because she was on a final written warning for tardiness. Her failing grade comes from not completing a required assignment. 

I do not know if she has ADHD. I will keep that in mind in the future if I see this again. 

I have requested that the course professor edit the syllabus next term to include a clause for late assignments. It’s not my syllabus to write. I don’t teach in the classroom. 

Due to a lot of comments I’ve read, I now realize that I need to be more of a hard ass in enforcing attendance rules and wasn’t doing anyone any favors trying to be lenient. So, in the future I will allow the one tardy with a warning. Second time I will send them home. 

Thank you everyone for your feedback! I really was conflicted over it. I felt like since I have her a final written warning saying her next tardy resulted in her being sent home, she needed to be sent home. I just struggled a bit because of it being her last chance to complete her assignment. But you’ve all made me realize that it was her choice and she was aware of those consequences. I appreciate all of your comments, no matter how you voted. It helped me to look deeper at what I was doing and what I will do in the future.",False,1575839479.0,2019-12-07 15:52:15
AITA for refusing to support our daughter after she gives birth?,19767,Not the A-hole,1176,hd4tiv,1592764454.0,"Edit: Thank you so much for your kind responses, I've tried to read all the comments but this blew up overnight. However some general things: 
1. Our 27f daughter assumed she could live with and be financially supported by us in the year after her child was born because our eldest went through significant financial hardship when she was trying to have a baby due to paying for ivf/fertility treatments and as a result almost ended up homeless because they remortgaged their house to afford it but then her husband was in a car accident and needed time off work meaning they were unable to pay their mortgage and the bank claimed their home.
2. I dunno what I can say to convince you this is real, yes its from a throwaway because my main account has part of my real name on it and both my 27f daughter and my son and his wife are familiar with it. There were 3 edits to this post. Originally it included a couple of paragraphs about how our 27f daughter made some homophobic comments about my wife's brother getting married to another man, and also some statements she made towards the BLM movement, however that post was over the 3000 word count and i decided to remove them as they aren't applicable to the current situation and i wanted to focus more on our immediate family issue rather than get into a big lgbt/blm argument. When I reposted it the post was removed because ""this is not a debate sub"", so I changed the title and reposted it as it is.
3. My wife and i have been supporters of the blm movement since before we got married 33 years ago, I came from a very racist family who disowned my older sister for marrying a black man and then kicked me out as a 16yo for sneaking out of the house so I could go to my sisters wedding. We haven't really been LGBT supporters(we haven't been anti LGBT, just not a part of rallies/donations) until my wife's brother came out a few years ago and since then we have made more of an effort to go to parades and donation to things like the Trevor project.

Second edit to say that our 27yo daughter will not be homeless if we don't support her for the year following the birth. It was just supposed to be an opportunity for her to spend time with us as otherwise they live over 2 hours away. As far as Im aware they own their home outright and her husband is financially well off enough to support her during this time without our help. 

Also our adoptive grandson is only 9 so a bit young to understand why some parts of the family don't like him. 




I'm not going to go into real detail but essentially my 27f daughter has recently said some very racist things. Since she married her husband she seems to have changed as a person and is much more distant and vicious towards the family, things came to a head last weekend at our first big family get together since covid when she said that our eldest daughters adopted son(who is black, he was adopted because our eldest and her husband are unable to have children) ""wasnt really a part of the family"" and that ""God didn't mean for you(eldest daughter) to have children, just accept what he gave you and stop forcing your options(referring to the son) on the rest of us"". Our eldest and her son were devastated and some very heated words were exchanged before my 27yo daughter and her husband stormed out. 

Now recently our 27yo daughter has announced she is pregnant, she and her husband were planning on moving into the cottage on our property after the baby is born so my wife and I can help out for the first year. During this time our daughter doesn't plan on working and has been clear that she expects us to contribute to her financial costs during the year(we had a similar arrangement with our eldest whe she was trying for a baby, and our son and his wife also spent 6 months living in the cottage after their twins were born). However after discussing with my wife we feel that this would make the rest of the family uncomfortable with visiting us(obviously eldest and her son no longer want to cone over while 27f and her husband are here and pur sons Latina wife has also expressed her discomfort around 27f and her husband)and we are uncomfortable supporting people who are so blatantly racist. 

We told our daughter last Thursday in a zoom chat about our decision and she blew up at us, demanding to know why she wasn't allowed to express her option and arguing that we aren't black so why should we care? My wife became very upset and closed the chat and has refused to speak to our daughter since and she is blaming herself for not raising her better.

AITA for wanting my sister to give me vegan options at her wedding?,19734,No A-holes here,6551,e2gmib,1574893152.0,"My sister is getting married in August 2020. My boyfriend (who is also vegan) and I are both invited. My sister reached out to me the day of the proposal and asked me to be a bridesmaid, which I was ecstatic about. My sister and I are very close, so she said it would be really meaningful to her if I was in the wedding party. I’m really excited for her, and I feel great that she values me enough to give me a spot. 

Her and her fiance have been on top of planning everything to avoid stress and pushing things off to the last minute. One of the things they already have picked are the venue and catering. I asked my sister about food options knowing there will likely only be a couple of dishes we can eat, but she told me there won’t be any options for us. Now I’m used to picking from a few side dishes, so I wasn’t expecting a lot, but my sister knows I’m vegan and knew it well before she got engaged. Apparently even the vegetables are going to be very buttery, so we can’t even eat those. I don’t expect a whole vegan friendly wedding, but I’m sure at least one option couldn’t have hurt. 

I asked my sister about including at least one thing for me, and she just told me I was probably going to have to find something else to bring in to eat or that I should eat before the wedding so I won’t be hungry when everyone else sits down to eat. Like what? 

This honestly would not be a huge deal if I was going to someone else’s wedding who I wasn’t very close to, but my sister stressed and emphasized so much about how important it was to her that my boyfriend and I be there, then she won’t bother to make sure we can actually eat anything then tells me to just bring something else in while everyone else is catered to. 

I understand it’s her wedding. She has enough on her plate already, and I won’t try to make her change the menu for us, but we both feel hurt that we’re just being tossed to the side and told to fend for our own food.

AITA for walking out of a job interview?,19714,Not the A-hole,1321,gqayhg,1590442084.0,"Around this time last year, I was in the job hunt and was looking at tech sales positions in my area. I’d been in this career about ten years, and had been recently laid off.

I was granted an interview at a relatively large startup downtown, and after the initial phone screen, I did my research and went on site for my in-person interview.

Admittedly, I got there about 25 minutes early, which was pushing obnoxious, but nobody was at the front desk. So I signed in using the iPad, took a seat, and waited. I waited until the time of the interview, got up, looked around, and started trying to get the attention of people walking around, as nobody had acknowledged me to this point.

At 15 minutes past the interview scheduled time, a lady came into the lobby and asked what I was there for. I let her know I had an interview scheduled for 15 minutes ago. She asked me to hold on and went back into the office, and a few minutes later, came back with an agenda with materials laid out about the company. The agenda confirmed that were were supposed to have already started, and that I had two interviewers in the next two 30-minute blocks.

A new person came over and sat me in a room and told me to read over the materials to get familiar. I did this for 45 minutes, and when the VP of sales didn’t show up to interview me, I got pissed, stood up, and left. I found my way to the front desk and told the person who was not there before and had likely no idea who I was that I was ending my interview, and to have a great day.

About 15 minutes later, I got a frantic call from the recruiter saying the VP was looking for me and that they wanted to start my interview. I answered that if they weren’t willing to respect my time, then I knew all I needed to know about what working there would be like.

I told several folks this story, and it’s been a 50/50 on whether or not I did the right thing, or that I don’t know the circumstances and that I could have stuck around and at least interviewed and let them know later on. AITA?",False,False,2020-05-25 14:28:04
AITA for giving a company my honest opinion on their interview process when they asked for it?,19803,Not the A-hole,1222,hi6t5z,1593487788.0,"I applied for a job a few months ago, it was a completely online work from home job regardless of the current situation so all communication and process was done online. This was for a retail consultant position for the online shoppers. They could seek advice from the consultant if they needed help choosing products. 

I received an email saying they would like to interview me. Sweet. I got an email link for a zoom call the next week. I had no idea how many people would be on this call or who I would be talking to. 

I join the call and there are like 30 of us on there. The hiring rep tells us all to mute ourselves as we will be listening and not talking. We proceeded to sit through a 2 hour presentation on the company history, their finances, goals, and every little gritty detail that nobody actually cares about. At the end of the presentation they told us that they had been watching our faces to see how our engagement was during the presentation to determine who would move onto the next interview step. They said they would select 5 people out of the 30 on the call. 

After the call they wanted us to write a 3 page essay about a particular topic from a list they provided us. We had 2 hours to turn it in. 

Well I did not get selected and received that email the next day. Along with that email was an attached form they wanted reviewing the interview process with a blank box at the end to “give them our honest opinion on the interview process”. 

I told them honestly that I found it a bit inappropriate and not very well organized that I had to dedicate 5 hours of my time to an interview for a position they weren’t even considering me for. I explained that had I been in the final pool of candidates it would have been fine but having me watch a 2 hour presentation on the company and write a 3 page essay just so I can be weeded out in the first step was just not the business. 

I received a nasty email back from the hiring recruiter saying that they’re glad they didn’t hire me with that kind of an attitude and just a bunch of other rude stuff. I didn’t reply. 

My bf and mom think that I was out of line and that if I really wanted the job I wouldn’t have an issue with doing all of that work. Again I wouldn’t if I was actually being considered for employment but I just found it weird that I had to go through all that as a preliminary screen. AITA?

AITA for forcing my son to see how difficult it is to raise a baby?,19650,Not the A-hole,3076,ca83jg,1562542517.0,"My son sat me and his mother down last week and told us he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. He is only 17 and she is 16. I told him I was proud that he came forward to tell me, but I didn't get too far into the discussion before he told me that they are keeping the baby. Both have not graduated high school, and frankly, both are quite irresponsible. According to him, having a child is ""easy"" and not ""really that hard"". We tried to persuade him to look at other options, but he was adamant that they were going to have the kid and that was the end of that.

Since then, the house has been quite tense. Any talk of the situation is immediately shut-down and my son refuses to see what we are attempting to show him. I have decided to teach him that kids are more difficult then he initially thinks. Since my son told us they were pregnant, I have done the following:

1. I wake him up twice a night, 2 hours apart after he has fallen asleep. I open the door, scream as loud as I can until I know he is awake, and I shut the door. I've done this 5 nights in a row.
2. I purchased a sack of flour for him and dressed it in a diaper. I have made him change the diaper every 2 hours, and if he doesn't, I shut off the internet until he changes it. I will sometimes smear nutella in the diaper for added effect/mess.
3. While playing one of his games, I told him his ""baby"" wanted to be held. Giving me a truly shit-eating grin, he told me he has no issue playing his game and holding the baby. I placed the sack of flour in his arms and he continued to play basically one handed. While he was doing this, I went to the kitchen, grabbed a small cup of applesauce and splashed it on his shoulder while he was playing. I told him that his baby spit up and he might want to pause his game to take care of that.
4. I have not allowed him to go to the movies or hang out with his friends at their house. When he presses me for a reason, I tell him ""You dont have a babysitter. You can go if you take your sack of flour with you."" He has not gone anywhere in a week.
5. Yesterday, I did my best pratfall in front of his friends who were over and then wailed and cried until he came over and started talking to me. I told him babies demand attention, and he will have to get used to this. This was the last straw for him.

After his friends left, he accused me of being an asshole and for being ridiculous with the wants and needs of a baby. He told me I am being completely unrealistic. I reminded him that he himself was an incredibly fussy baby, and everything I have done so far he has done to me in the past.

His mother tells me I am being an asshole and to let him make his own decisions, but I don't want my 17 year shackled to a baby when neither of them are ready for this. If anything, I want him to realize how hard this is going to be, and to at least look at options.

AITA for removing the stereo faceplate from my car before a long (3+ hours) drive because my GF wouldn't stop muting it to take/make phone calls?,19609,Not the A-hole,2105,d5iwaj,1568764220.0,"To preface this i think i might have overreacted because honestly? i can't stand driving. i hate it. but i gotta get places and where i live that means driving.

Little bit of info first, my car is an older car with the stereo that you can change the faceplate, like the buttons and stuff. a few years ago i sent it to a mechanic friend for a tune-up and he put bluetooth in it as a gift.

I occasionally(usually averages out to once or twice every 2-3 months) have to drive several hours to see a specialist for a medical condition I've had since i was born. over the last year or so my GF(R) has started to come with me, which i appreciate very much because i know hospitals bring back a lot of not-good memories for her.

For the Issue at hand. R is very much a social butterfly and loves to talk on the phone. whenever she gets a call she'll reach over and turn the volume all the way down or mute it, not even pausing my music/podcast or whatever. it's an almost unconscious action. if i try to turn it back up, my hand either gets swatted away or i get told ""this is important"", or ""i need to hear this"". if this was once or twice during a drive it's whatever i don't care that much. but if it's a 3 hour drive, she's on the phone with friends or doing errands over the phone for at least half of it. we've had multiple talks about it, but she just either brushes me off or insists she's not on the phone for that long.

it drives me up a wall, i hate sitting in traffic listening to half a conversation that doesn't have anything to do with me, for hours. so this time before we left, i connected my bluetooth to the car and then took the faceplate off so the only way you could control it was though my phone, which was in my pocket.

she's pretty mad, not about that music, but that she felt i was treating her like a teenager and punishing her. i felt that it wasn't about punishing her, but just actually being able to listen to my podcast without being unreasonably interrupted.

Edit: to answer some FAQs, She doesn't drive, never has. we both live in the city and it wasn't necessary for her because she either walks or bikes to work. the hospital is in the next city over.

i always run the podcast(if that's the plan sometimes just music.) by her the night before or that morning because i download it to not use any data, we both like crime shows and stand-up podcasts so it's usually in that vein, Dr death, YMH, bill burr, court junkies, stuff like that. I love to talk to her, and am more than happy to pause anything for conversation, but if she's on the phone i would at least like to be able to listen to something i enjoy also. turn it down, by all means, just not off. and if you have to turn it off, at least pause it so i don't have to play catch-up 20 minutes later when I'm allowed to listen again

i can't use headphones, it's illegal to do that and drive where i am. she doesn't like to take phonecalls with headphones, which i can't really blame her for, because i don't like to either.

I've brought this up both immediately before and after drives, and the response is either a promise not to touch the volume when she's on the phone that gets broken after 20 mins or platitudes that's she's not on she's not on the phone for THAT long. if i ask her to check the timecodes of a call or how many she thought she made she gets extremely defensive and just accuses me of trying to start an argument. I never asked her to come on these routine trips so i try to just let it go when we get there and just enjoy her being there with me. i have asked her to come on more serious appointments, where surgery is involved or i stay overnight. but even during a routine trip i try plan something to do so the whole day isn't wasted, a nice or famous restaurant or something.

after thinking about it and how I felt for the last few hours i really think she's in denial about how long she's on the phone, and I feel slighted and angry because i feel like i need her permission to listen to the stereo in my car. I'll talk to her more when she gets home, if we've both cooled off enough.",False,1568759059.0,2019-09-17 16:50:20
AITA for making my pregnant SIL sleep on an air mattress?,19570,Not the A-hole,4364,e106s0,1574639728.0,"My partner and I bought a house this summer, and for Thanksgiving we’re hosting my parents-in-law, my sister-in-law (SIL), and her husband. SIL is due with her first baby at the end of February.

The plan is to have parents (in their late 60’s) sleep in our guest bedroom on a proper frame and mattress. That leaves our office, with an air mattress (a decent one, but still) for SIL and her husband. 

Last time SIL visited overnight a few months ago, we had other guests already staying in the guest bedroom for several weeks and felt it would be a lot to have them move all their personal items, so we gave her the air mattress again.  She made a big deal about how pregnant people should get priority sleeping arrangements, even if it means uprooting someone for a night. She recently mentioned to my partner that maybe she and her husband should take our master bedroom when they come in a few days for the holiday.

I’ve never been pregnant, and I can respect that maybe you just want some damn comfort as you grow a human. However, I think my judgment may be clouded by my annoyance that she historically makes a stink about getting what she wants, pregnant or not. Further, I currently live long-distance from my partner, and I am only home for the week. I just want to enjoy the visit, appreciate the home we’ve bought AND sleep in my master bedroom, dammit. AITA?

EDIT: Thanks for all of your suggestions and reality checks. I really liked the suggestion from /u/lizard_windowpane to leave it to the in-laws in a group chat to determine who sleeps where. Realistically, it feels a bit late in the game to insinuate via text that SIL would be better off not showing up, so my partner and I have decided to put our nice comfy mattress into the office for SIL and rock out on the air mattress in our room for the visit. Is it a perfect solution? No, but SIL and elder in-laws get much-needed comfort, we keep our room. Hopefully next year, we’ll just be guests!",False,1574641498.0,2019-11-24 15:55:28
WIBTA if I didn’t give up MY honey moon villa to my grandparents?,19576,Not the A-hole,3097,ci22ko,1564171831.0,"My family is Asian, my husbands side is white.

My husband and I got married and are treating his side of the family, and my side to a 1 week all expense paid vacation to bora bora as a pre family honeymoon before going off on our “real” one. 
We were able to rent out half a side of the bungalows and only one villa was in that section. My husband and I took the villa.

The bungalows are a 1000 sq feet 1 bedroom(option of 1 king bed or 2 queens), 1 bathroom, and out door space type of deal. We made sure everyone was accommodated for and everyone had a comfortable living situation. 

Our villa is a 4000 sq ft 1 bedroom, 1 bath including sauna, living room, a grand out door space, with an outdoor bath tub, pool and slide to get in the ocean. 

We have not even made it a whole 24 hours here yet and a fight has already broken out. During dinner, my cousin mentioned wanting to come over and use our slide. My grandparents asked what we were talking about and asked to see pictures of our room. 

Well, they saw my villa and demanded that we trade rooms with them as no elders should made to “slave” and live as “peasants” while their grandchildren get a nicer room. 

This is bora bora we’re talking about. No one is living as a peasant here. 

There was only 1 villa available in our section. Had I given it to my grandparents I think it would’ve been offensive to my husbands grandparents. If there was 3, we would’ve given it to both grandparents and 1 for ourself. But unfortunately, there wasn’t. I mentioned this and they still demanded the villa.

I obviously objected, and said I felt as though my husband and I should have that room as this is a vacation with family to celebrate OUR marriage, plus we paid for this entire trip? Wouldn’t one just sit back and be grateful they’re on a free vacation instead of complaining?

My grandparents freaked out. Saying I’m holding money above their head and that I’m being disrespectful and not following their orders. They stormed off after threatening to take the first flight out tomorrow morning and leaving. 

Idk what to do. My side of the family is telling me to just give them the room to be respectful and bring peace to the family, while my husbands side thinks my grandparents are bat shit crazy and I agree. They are so ridiculous. All I wanted was both sides of the family to get together and get to know each other and now it’s falling apart. 

I don’t think I’m the asshole at all, but I’ve been up all night thinking wether I should just squash it and invite my grandparents to stay in my villa in order for them not to leave. But another part of me just wants to tell them to go fuck themselves for making my honey moon about themselves, just like they do with everything else. 

So Reddit, what do I do? WIBTA if I denied giving up my villa?



***UPDATE***
Even though I really wanted to be petty and tell them to fuck off, I decided it’d be better to kill them with kindness so they have little to work with if they decide to spin it around that I was disrespectful.

During breakfast my grandparents refused to show up if I was there. Everyone tried calling them-nope we’re not coming cause disrespectful granddaughter is there. After a lot of persuading and even having to send our baby cousin to their room to soften them up, they finally decided to come. 

I made the first conversation by asking if they looked at any flights to leave yet, they could forward the paystub to my cell. They said they hadn’t looked yet and that should be my job if I was kicking them out?? I made sure they knew I was not kicking them out, but understood if they wanted to leave and offered to send some staff to their room to pack up their belongings so they could have a little more time to explore, or get their complimentary in room massage that comes with all the bungalows. 

They kind of stopped eating and looked at each other in shock. Every time they threaten not to go anywhere, my family has always babied them and begged them not to leave and offer money or extravagant gifts for them to stay. 

Well, I’m not doing that. 
I’ll pay for their flight back home, but I’ve already done enough accommodating on MY honeymoon vacation. 

So there you have it. My grandparents weren’t even planning to go home, they tried scaring me into begging them to stay. I called their bluff. 

After breakfast, I found a flight leaving around 5pm and walked to the main desk to ask them to cancel reservations for that room for the rest of the trip and to send staff to help pack. They also didn’t get their complimentary massage because the resort only offers that on 4 night stays or longer. 

Staff came to help pack, and they left half an hour ago. Im currently in my villa de stressing before dinner and some uncles came in(who were married into family) and confided in me that they were sick and tired of the entitlement my grandparents have had since day 1 and they were glad someone born into the family decided to speak up. My cousins came over and honestly couldn’t care less my grandparents are gone, in their words “they kill the vibe”. So everyone’s happy right now and is using my slide before cleaning up for dinner. 

I’m happy I was able to stand up to my grandparents without being blatantly disrespectful. 

I have an overflow of messages and comments, that I can’t get back to. However, the main question is what my profession is. 

I did not go the usual Asian route. I actually dropped out my last year of college and started a fashion line that took a couple years to take off, but surprisingly sky rocketed a few years ago. My dad is also an entrepreneur, I looked up to him and am so glad I had him as an inspiration who paved the way. Don’t give up on your dreams.",True,1573723159.0,2019-07-26 13:10:31
AITAH for letting my coworkers quit because I got fired?,19562,Not the A-hole,1335,drw1sf,1572968922.0,"A regular offered me $100 to take a shot with him, he has been drinking at the bar I worked at for over 10 years, I worked there for 4 years. I made a shot with sour mix and cranberry to match the color of his so he thought I was taking one. I just want to make extra money.

My manager happened to see this on the cameras. There is a strict no drinking policy at this bar for bartenders on the clock, and it’s a new manager who is trying to show her authority so she made an example of me and fired me.

There is no way to prove there wasn’t booze in my shot, I saw the footage and with the liquor gun we have right next to the pop gun there is no way to prove I didn’t put liquor in that shot.

I honestly don’t and didn’t care enough to argue with her about it. I’m about to start a new job since I graduate from school after this semester and am not to concerned about my future in bartending.

I trained basically every new person at this bar, and I was honest with them that I was fired in our work group chat. They all started saying if you got fired for that we don’t want to work here either. They were all saying bad things about the manager and how they want to screw the whole bar over by all quitting at the same time.

I told them that our new manager is balls to the walls. I said I’m going to be just fine, but not to make my same mistake and drink ANYTHING out of a shot glass because she is that concerned about it. I also told them to think for themselves and do whatever they need to when it comes to their jobs.

I then let my anger overtake me and I said “if you want to find a job where you don’t have to be constantly looking over your back and have to be worried about an insane manager find different bartending and serving jobs. You’re all capable people that don’t deserve a psycho watching over you when you’ve put good time into a work place.” I basically contradicted myself. 

I feel like I went over the top, my sister said I should’ve kept my mouth shut. But I explained the whole situation to the old manager, who taught me the “mix things together to look like booze so people don’t feel rejected when they buy you shots trick”. She thinks it’s crazy the new manager won’t trust me after training so many people in and my old manager loves me.

My old manager quit because she was moving away with her fiancé, but she told the new manager that I was trustworthy and I thought the new manager would have some trust considering I was basically running the bar when she came in. 

Whatever the case, AITAH for letting a lot of employees quit on my behalf? Because as of now 7/10 bartenders where I was fired from are planning a group quit. I don’t want the bar to close, but I want my manager to realize that she messed up...",False,False,2019-11-05 07:48:42

I moved out and the doll house stayed at my mom’s. Now my mom has grandkids(my sister’s kids) and they have destroyed it. A bunch of pieces are missing, the lights have been torn out, the carpet and curtains have been torn up, the chimney is broken, etc. When I saw it I was hurt at how destroyed this incredible gift from my now deceased father was.

She asked if she could have it or at least bring it back to mom’s bc her kids play with it. 

I didn’t want to start a big uproar so I tried to kindly explain that I wanted to keep it preserved how dad made it. I told her the kids can play with it when they are at my house but they needed to get better about taking care of it and not messing everything up.

UPDATE: WIBTA If I cancelled our wedding?,19534,UPDATE,638,d0n7fi,1567835520.0,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cuvkw3/wibta_if_i_cancelled_our_wedding/

TLDR at the bottom! 

Hello, all! It's been some time since I laid out all the bullshit my fiance and I were dealing with in regards to planning our wedding and such. We were so overwhelmed with the immense response and support, so, thank you to everyone who contributed and offered advice. Now, on to what happened! 

My fiance and I talked it through, the pros and cons, etc. We both realized how unhappy we were with how things were going and decided that we were going to cancel the wedding and move forward with eloping. We decided that we didn't want it to be just us, but a small group of family and friends as well. We were both ecstatic, but, also EXTREMELY worried at how our parents were going to take it. Especially considering our guest list went from over 120 people, to 20. But, we were both committed and he decided to tell his parents and I would then tell mine. 

Surprisingly, his parents were SO supportive and extremely ecstatic that we were getting eloped. They were even more excited when we let them know we wanted them there and they booked their flight soon after! They also handled telling their families and friends in Texas that we were eloping and to get over it. So, that saved us the trouble! His other family was very supportive and wished us the best. My father also was incredibly supportive and couldn't wait to be there. My mother on the hand, was FURIOUS.

The phone call to her started off calmly enough and I did let her know before beginning the conversation that she most likely wouldn't enjoy this. But, I pressed forward. I told her our reasons, our stresses, how we felt disrespected and disregarding concerning everything, I laid it all out in a calm and collected manner. Once finished, she was very quite and simply said, alright. I knew immediately that I was pretty well fucked, but, we ended the phone call with her stating she understood. 

Less than 24 hours later, she texts me asking if my brother (whom one of our biggest stressors was about) was invited. I was pissed because I had just had this conversation with her and explicitly told her who was invited and etc. I responded back with a simple no and that my father, grandmother and herself were invited. Well, shit hit the fan.

She sent me a wall of texts, calling me all sorts of names, throwing my fiance's family in my face and how we took their side, how I never truly gave a shit about her feelings, all the good stuff. I remained calm and before sending each response, consulted my fiance as to not sound like a total bitch. Long story short, she said unless my brother is invited, she won't be coming. So, I told her not to come. I was over it and stopped responding to her texts. 

For days she texted me, saying all the same as before and kept asking if my brother was invited. I responded once and told her that until she apologized (she won't) that I wouldn't be seeing or speaking to her about anything regarding the wedding. I offered an open seat to our wedding, whether she shows or not, is completely up to her. 

My fiance and I have already booked a small venue for our elopment and are more excited planning this than our previous wedding and are looking forward to our future! 

TLDR: We are eloping, bitches!

AITA for telling my future father in law I’m a different race every time he asks?,19527,Not the A-hole,1543,eclu5c,1576747110.0,"I am marrying into my fiancés white family next summer, and I have been with him for almost 4 years now, and I met his family very early on, less than a year in. I am Latina, but third generation, but I guess I must look very racially ambiguous because I get a lot of questions and guesses. That being said, my fiancé’s dad KNOWS I’m Latina. He’s met my parents, and he’s asked before. 

Ever since we announced our engagement, his moms been very involved in planning so we’re around his parents a lot more often. FIL has asked NUMEROUS times “what are you again?” Or “you’re (insert random race of brown people) right?” And other variations. At first I didn’t think much of it but it happens SO often that I can’t help but think it’s on purpose. My fiancé and his mom seem to not think much of it, or they’ll just laugh it off as if he’s joking or implying it’s funny that he’s “forgotten” again. This seriously happens like once a week I wanna say. 

So, I’ve just started “joking” back and either confirming I’m whatever he thinks I am that day, or I just tell him something random. My fiancé thought it was funny at first but has now changed his mind and thinks I’m being disrespectful. I think it’s his dad being disrespectful, and I’m dealing with it in a funny lighthearted way. AITA

EDIT: I meant ethnicity not race! Sorry!

ANOTHER EDIT: guys... it’s okay! I think this has gotten out of hand. My future FIL is being annoying at worst, it might have racial undertones but he’s a normal decent guy who treats me well outside of all this, not some sort of hateful racist monster. I assumed the fact that I’m able to joke back to him about it implied that this is honestly all in good fun, just because it has some serious undertones doesn’t mean it’s some sort of relationship ending catastrophe. If it helps, imagine he was calling me by the wrong name and I gave him a fake one each time. It’s not as racially charged, but it’s honestly about the same energy behind it if that makes sense. I’m engaging in this discussion and getting into the racial implications because I genuinely find it interesting and fun, but it really doesn’t have to be as serious as it’s gotten.

AITA for not letting my sister and bil sleep in my room instead of the living room?,19517,Not the A-hole,1598,gkfn66,1589599369.0,"
My sister, bil, and their son moved in with me for due to financial issues. They have been here for around a month now.

I only have a two bedroom place though. So my sister and bil have been bunking down in our living room and their son is staying in my sons room.

They’ve asked if we could change the sleeping arrangements, so they (sister and bil) get one of the bedrooms and the boys stay in the living room. She said she and her husband were having problems because they never have any privacy for just the two of them.
 
I said no to that because my son (who is autistic) needs to keep his sleeping arrangements and space the same otherwise he will have a meltdown and I’ll have a hard time getting him to bed. 

 My sister understood that and then asked if I could stay in the living room then. She thinks it makes more sense for the single person to sleep in the living room instead of the couple who could share a bed. And yeah, from a neutral point of view it makes more sense, but come one this is my home. I want to keep my private area to myself in my home. It’s already driving me crazy having them here all the time. It’s only going to be worse if I don’t have someplace to retreat to. 

I also don’t want to have to sleep on a couch or air mattress in my home. I want to sleep in my bed where I won’t wake up with a backache.

Also let’s be real I don’t want my sister having sex in my bed. If I had a guest room I wouldn’t care, but them being in my own personal bed just makes me uncomfortable. Like I totally get that not having privacy and not being able to have sex sucks for them, but I don’t think that that should effect me.

So, I told her no to that too and now my sister and bil are basically giving me the silent treatment. They’re also both getting snippy with each other and arguing in hushed tones.",False,False,2020-05-15 20:22:49

I was woken up at 1 p.m. with a hit on my head by my 1 year old sister and her plastic toy. I had just stayed up until 4 a.m. feeding my newborn sister because my mom couldn't. My mom just had a c-section so she couldn't move or walk for a long time so she is often on a chair. A few hours later, she and I were arguing about groceries (she spent $300 on JUST meat 2 weeks ago, so the previous week, I spent $100 on snacks and household essentials like soap/shampoo and laundry detergent, she wanted me to list everything I bought and was yelling at me when I couldn't remember) and I went to my room in the middle of the argument because I was sick of the fighting. She told me to come downstairs and continued yelling stuff like ""don't make me go up there!"" And I knew she couldn't so I just stayed in my room crying. My dad called me and I explained the situation to him, he said if I didn't like her rules, then leave. Then my 16 y/o sister texted me ""mom said to leave the house"", so I packed. A friend picked me up and I walked out with necessities, and as I walked out, my mom said ""never come back"". My friend dropped me off to my best friends house and at that point, I had cried for like 3 hours straight. That was all 3 days ago.

2 days ago, my 16 y/o sister (who is pregnant and almost due) texted me that I needed to come home to watch my 1 y/o and newborn sisters for 2 hours so that she can go grocery shopping with my mom's boyfriend (1 y/o and newborn's dad, who is just recently unemployed but he's a nice guy) and I told her I wasn't coming back because my mom told me not to. My 1 y/o sister had choked on her food yesterday because I didn't go home to watch her while my mom was with the newborn, then my dad told me to drop my pride and go home just because she's my mom. This has nothing to do with pride, both my mom and dad told me to leave the house knowing she needed me. My parents had always told us kids that if we don't like living under their roof, then leave; we didn't have a reason and were too scared to do it. They must've been shocked when the only child of theirs who grew up without causing any trouble in school, or getting knocked up, or getting bad grades, and always helping them and putting up with their toxic ways, left. I want to help but my mom is very lazy, I often have to do everything around the house while watching my sisters. I'm only 18, my mom won't even take me to the DMV for my permit or license, even though she did it for my brother (the eldest child, he's living with my dad). I'm under constant stress because of my mom and nothing ever satisfies her. I am currently staying at my best friend's house and with my new free time, I can finally go around and apply for jobs and make something of myself.

My friend Ana sent a link for a green bateau dress and literally said “I love this but they don’t have it in my size.” (She is US 14.)

I agreed that the dress is beautiful while one of our other friends said that the skirt might be too wide for a bridesmaid dress. Ana went on to send more links of other dresses and our group’s conversation moved along. 

Yesterday Ana sent a message in our chat that she just ordered one of the dresses she showed us, and asked if we already chose a dress. I really liked the green bateau dress so I checked if they had it in my size (I am US 8) and they did so I told our group that I was going to order the bateau dress. No one replied immediately, but I didn’t think too much about it because it’s not uncommon for me and my friends to take a while before replying, specially during work hours. I ordered the dress.

A few hours later I got a call from one of my friends saying that Ana called her and was upset that I ordered the bateau dress, knowing she liked it but couldn’t buy it because it wasn’t available in her size. My friend said Ana thinks I’m trying to make her feel bad about her weight by flaunting that I can wear the dress she likes because I’m skinnier. 

To be honest I have mixed emotions about what Ana said, but trying to fix things comes first so I tried calling Ana and sending her messages to apologize, explaining that I didn’t intend for her to feel that way. But she hasn’t answered my calls or messages.

I told him the first few times, “Please call me Jane or Mrs. Smith, I don’t like being called professor.” He said “Okay” each time, but continued to do it. This is an English-speaking student, who is more than capable of saying my name.

As it continued, I tried to not get more annoyed. Now, we’re about halfway through the semester. He was still doing it, so I started referring to him as “student”, rather than his name. For example,

“Professor, I have a question.”

“Yes, student?”

“Professor, how do you complete xyz?”

“Well, student…” and then explain it.

He wrote me an e-mail asking me to stop doing this. I responded that I would as soon as he started calling me by my name.

My wife came to me last week and suggested I stop giving my dad 1k a month as he now gets a small pension from work and an old age pension from the govt and he basically has no bills except for minimal utilities, food, gas on a benz I bought him for his 65th bday and personal stuff. I told her that I want him to chill now that he's older and worked hard his whole life and the extra 1k I give him helps him eat at a better restaurant, get a nicer suit, go on holidays etc. He also started seeing a woman who's in her 40's and they're pretty happy so I'm extremely happy for my dad. The money helps with dates and stuff like that and gives him a better standard of living. My wife just basically put her foot down and told me that we need to save more but we don't I pulled in 500k last year, she made around 110k and we are doing very well and have no kids and I own our condo we live in outright. She basically called me an asshole for guilting her into giving money to my dad and said he's a grown man and can figure things out himself.

AITA for forbidding my trans-sister-in-law from observing me giving birth,19409,Not the A-hole,1066,f48bf4,1581795520.0,"Throwaway obviously, this is a pretty unique situation so I think my main account will get identified pretty fast otherwise. I'm 32/F/Florida.

So basically, I thought this was a pretty cut and dry situation, but apparently not, as I'm getting a lot of judgement (some bordering on abuse) from different people and my phone is blowing up. So I want to know if I was out of line.

So I'm 6 months pregnant, and I've been very open about what kind of way I want to give birth. I've discussed this with my group of girlfriends extensively, along with my family. I ideally want to have a natural, unassisted birth at home, which is near a hospital if things start to shape up as problematic. Now, for this process, I want support, and of course my husband is going to be there, but also I want my two sisters to be with me. 

This is where things get controversial. In my many conversations with friends and family, I mentioned I want my sisters there with me. I do not want my brother there, that would just be weird! But, in these conversations, my trans-sister-in-law was present, and she got the idea she would be included in this childbirth situation. Just for reference she transitioned around 3 years ago. I was unaware of this until last week, when she told me if there is anything in particular she should bring for the birth. I calmly mentioned that I am very selective over who I want in this very intimate situation, and told her than I hope she isn't offended if she isn't there for the birthing. 

This is when things blew up. She lost her temper and I got a torrent of emotional outbursts.  She said that she would never be able to give birth herself and excluding her is taking away from her womanhood and depriving her of her only chance of experiencing this expression of femininity. When she found out my two sisters were going to be there she told me that I was transphobic and she has as much of a right to be there as they do. 

After this, I received many emails, facebook messages, and text messages from several different people, calling me  transphobe and many other hurtful things. My trans-sister-in-law is very active in the transactivism community (which I fully support), and apparently she told them what had transpired. This has obviously rallied them to harass me, and now I'm starting to wonder if I messed up. 

I kind of wish I never mentioned anything about the birthing process to her, maybe I should have just kept all these plans to myself so she wouldn't feel excluded. I'm aware transpeople have a pretty shitty deal in life, and perhaps this added to their feelings of exclusion. But the other part of me says, it's my birthing, I'm going to very vulnerable and exposed, and I (perhaps selfishly) owe it to myself to make it as comfortable and safe for me as possible.

UPDATE AITA for not wanting to do more chores even though my boyfriend works more hours?,19415,UPDATE,646,gpt4lp,1590368370.0,"Hey everyone, I thought I'd post an update on my situation although it is nothing spectacular. 

After I made my last post I realised how frustrated I actually was. So I sat down with my boyfriend and we had a serious talk. I told him that I want to go back to the old split. He wasn't happy but I told him it's not up for discussion and if he doesn't like it he can hire a maid (he couldn't afford this). I went okayish for about two weeks though I had to nag him constantly. 

But then 3 weeks ago my professor offered to extend my duties with him. I wouldn't only be his academic assistant anymore but I could work in a more practical field with him too. I was thrilled and obviously accepted. I told my boyfriend that since I'll be working even more now and he doesn't work at all I would want a real 50/50 split. This means I would have wanted him to cook and grocery shop too. He cracked the shits and told me he's already upped his game over the last few weeks and doesn't need to do more. 

This made me think and I came to the conclusion that I didn't want to be with him anymore. Once I had formed the thought in my head it was all clear to me and I didn't really have to think about it for long. I told him two weeks ago. I told him that my decision is final and there was no room for negotiation. He wasn't happy and promised he'd do better if I give him another chance. I didn't and moved out.

AITA for removing all the cutlery and dishes in my shared apartment?,19401,Not the A-hole,3989,d78ke1,1569088629.0,"I have always set a pretty basic rule for my roommates, and that is that only I can use a certain set of cutlery and dishes that has special sentimental value to me. All the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but I told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.

Things worked pretty well at first but over time I caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. After the third or so time I sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. They all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and I told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.

I came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. I see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead I just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. After this during the middle of the night I took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. It took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. 

Queue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. Queue bitching. Queue tantrums and accusations about me being a ""dicklord"". I don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. I'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when I regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think I'm an ass for good now and I had only created an awkward situation that won't go.

AITA for drinking alcohol at every family gathering and cryptically smiling when somebody suggested I do it because I can't handle hanging out with them?,19390,Not the A-hole,1678,e9o8yw,1576189724.0,"I'm a grown ass man, I'm 32, my family is huge and unbelievably annoying. I'm gay and that is the Voldemort of our family. Everyone knows about it, and most are afraid to acknowledge it. For that reason, everyone is fucking weird around me, they never know what to talk to me about, they're afraid of asking me anything so they don't really know much about me or my life, and they usually end up talking about the weather, themselves, or my seven million nieces and nephews.

Years ago I started dealing with the problem by coming to such gatherings as rarely as possible, and when I have to be there, I just get drunk. Not the lying-under-the-table-puking-in-Nana's-shoes plastered, but finding-everything-amusing drunk. I'm not normally a drinker, so it doesn't take me much to get to that stage.

However, recently, my brother made the observation that I drink every time he sees me. He sounded almost worried and asked if I drink every day, and I said no, not at all. Then he started laughing and said: what, you only drink when you see us? Huehuehue you couldn't handle being around us sober, huh? Huehue! 

And I just sort of smiled, and took a sip of my mulled wine and didn't respond.

20 minutes later, my mom comes up to me and says my brother's wife told her I only get drunk when I'm around them because I can't stand any of them. I ask her how my sister in law knows that, because I never said it. She goes away and comes back with my SIL who admits I never said it, but I never denied it either. They put me on the spot so I said it's not as bad as that, I just find it easier to socialize with so many people if I have 2-3 drinks.

My mom and SIL were like nooope, you hate us, admit you hate us, well fine, if you hate us, fine, don't come see us anymore, who cares, we don't care, you don't care, nobody cares and so on and so forth. It was just a vomit of passive aggression that I wasn't able to get a word in, so finally, when they asked me to leave, I did.

The only person who's contacted me since then is my brother, who laughed when he spoke to me on the phone and said ""they didn't mean it"" but admitted that he felt it was assholish of me to get drunk at every gathering. Honestly, the other option for me is to not go at all. I'm going because they like seeing me and being with me (despite not liking most things ABOUT me), so I feel like getting a little drunk is the less assholish route than not going at all.

My parents have invited strangers to our house to talk to me when I was 17, to tell me I will never find happiness, truth or love as long as I am an immoral person, they outed me to the whole fucking town when they talked to the priest and he made me the topic of one of his Sunday services, which in turn resulted in every kid I went to school with to know I'm gay, bully me, beat the shit out of me.

They tried stopping me from going to university for fear it would exacerbate my gay feelings, they called me disgusting, an animal, an embarrassment, ""not my son"", my father demolished my room when I left for university and told me I wasn't welcome there anymore, I didn't speak to any of them for two years as a result of that and so on and so forth.

AITA for exploding on my father's wife,19376,Not the A-hole,3549,cunlba,1566641753.0,"Throwaway  

Hear me out on this one.

In regards to ages, I’m 17, Dad is 43, and father’s wife 27 or 28.

Six years ago, it came out during couple’s therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. My mom initiated divorce. Six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. My dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day I can truly forgive him.

I do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father’s wife, I begrudgingly show respect. I have never called her out of her name until later in this story. If she speaks to me, I will say something back. If I am in her home, I will clean up after myself. However, I will always refer to her as my father’s wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. This is something she cannot accept.

I have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. While at my father’ house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying “The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,” and said that I was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why I would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. I guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

She then revealed that when my dad gets back from his TDY (Temporary Duty Assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say “Don’t mess with her,” with her 2-month-old daughter. I have never been in any of the previous family portraits because I refused to and my Dad said I didn’t have to.

I told her I was not going to participate

She asked why I was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

Six years’ worth of hurt came out. I told her she was a fool to ever think I was her child or that I considered her family. From my perspective, she was nothing, but my father’s racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. I took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn’t my father’s child because she looks nothing like him.

She turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful I was and I had no right to talk to her in such a manner. I fully admit I called her a Bitch and stated she didn’t even deserve any respect from me because she didn’t respect my mother’s marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. After realizing what I had said, I left and haven’t talked to her since.

Everyone that I have talked to say I should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and I don’t mind doing that.  However, certain people say I shouldn’t have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.

AITA for Telling My Wife to Get Out of Bed and Feed the Damn Cat.,19358,No A-holes here,2517,dgves7,1570917119.0,"Alright everyone, I need some judgement on this one...

My wife and I have a happy, healthy (no chonkers) cat that we love except for on weekends when he will sit outside our bedroom door and meow non stop until one of us gets up to feed him. This only happens on weekends.

Monday-Friday my wife wakes up for work first at around 6:00 am and feeds the cat. However on weekends we both try to sleep in, so come 6:01 am our kitty alarm clock goes off and won't shut up until one of us gets up to feed him. He will literally cry for 2 hours straight if we try to ignore him.

Here's where the story takes a twist. Awhile back we bought a timed self feeder to use when we are away for vacations. When we tested out the self feeder we discovered the amazing benefit of the cat no longer crying to us for food because he gets fed at his usual time each morning. I thought this was fabulous and we should use the self feeder all the time to save our sleep sanity.

My wife disagreed. Her reasons range from:

Concerned that the self feeder might not drop the correct amount of food each time.

Concerned the cat might be able to reach his little murder mitten up the food chute and steal extra food between meals.

Concerned the cat won't ""love"" us anymore since we aren't the ones directly pouring his food into his dish.

Concerned it's a waste of batteries.

I've told my wife I understand all of her concerns but I still think the benefit of being able to sleep in without being woken up by a cat banshee outweighs the risks she has laid out. She still disagrees.

So I did the only thing that reddit hates more in relationships than cheating and gave my wife an ULTIMATUM! 

I told her that we either use the self-feeder or come 6:01 am Saturday morning when the cat wakes us both up, I'm kicking her (not litterally) out of bed to go feed the damn cat.

So reddit, AITA?

EDIT: I'm seeing a lot of people proposing the compromise of using the self feeder just on weekends. Unfortunately my wife has shot that idea down in the past too.

EDIT 2: Many people have been demanding I pay the ""cat tax"" and post a picture of the real AH in question. Sadly I am a Reddit failure and can't figure out how to attach a picture to the post. If anyone knows how to do this and can direct message me, I will gladly comply and pay the cat tax.

So I took a lot of your suggestions and I went to have a good conversation with my mom about the switch. I explained how fragile it was, how much the controllers were, and how much repairing it would take.

I offered that they could play but that it could be in my room sometimes and my siblings would have to buy their own controllers to play. She said she didn’t realize how fragile it was and that it was literally 10 inches of glass. She doesn’t seem to notice I have it in my room so that’s good lol.

She does prefer me to share it but she is happy to see that I enjoy my new purchase and since I was feeling happy I bought budget friendly ( pro controllers) for friends and family to play with. 

We love playing ultimate chicken horse and my favorite is smash ultimate! Thanks for helping me get through this and get the best outcome; I really needed it!

Sister's bf: You're oddly knowledgeable for someone who only went to community college.

Me: I didn't go to community college!

Sister's bf: (My sister's name) said that you did. Don't most technicians only need an Associates degree?

Me: She did.

Sister's bf: Then why did she go to community college?

Me: Because she flunked out...

So it's been a few months since my first post and since a few people were asking I thought I owed you an update. I would have provided one sooner but this is a throw away and I had logged out earlier (the fact I remember the password is itself a miracle).

The tldr of the last post was I had ignored my brother's attempts to have a relationship with me after the homophobic shit he threw at my when we were younger. I'm glad to say that's no longer the case.

A little after my last post I texted him that I appreciated his words but that his actions had really hurt me and that I needed time. He texted back he understood and to take as much time as I needed. He also thanked me for reaching back out to him.

I spent a lot of January and February in self-reflection and trying to figure out what I wanted. Lots of people in the last post said I needed therapy and I agree I likely did. I never ended up seeing a professional, but I got really into some guided meditation and calming exercises I saw on YouTube. Making a habit of it helped me realize how much weight I was carrying and has helped me start to let that weight down. I still have some ways to go but I can feel my empathy growing and I like that.

I went home for spring break and saw my bro for the first time since Christmas. Long story short, we spent a lot of time hanging out and our relationship is recovering. We've had some hard conversations, cried, shared a couple joints, etc. and I came away from the break feeling much better about everything. And since each of our schools have closed down due to the pandemic, we're both at home and doing our classes remotely and hanging out on the down time.

I want to thank those of you who said I'd probably regret cutting him out because I can tell you were right. My brother isn't perfect and did many things to purposely hurt me, but people can change if they want to and he did. I wouldn't want to be judged by my lowest point and I'm working on not judging him by his. I finally have my brother back and forgiving him has helped me feel better in ways I didn't realize I needed. Thank you.

Tl;Dr: forgiveness is a hell of a drug

**EDIT:** Holy what??? I step away from this to do homework for a couple hours and y'all gave me awards? Thank you so much

To answer some common questions: no, my bf from the OP and I are no longer together, but for separate reasons unrelated to the original post. We just wanted different things and were at different stages of our lives but it was a parting with minimal hard feelings. I don't consider his reaction to be manipulative - it wasn't a hard ""do this or we're through.""

Why my brother did it? There's no one reason. He was in a dark place and dealing with a lot of issues in a bad way. He was ignorant about a lot of LGBT stuff and relied on that ignorance when it came to me. It took a while and going off to college/meeting new people for him to begin questioning a lot he believed, and since getting help for his unresolved issues it was a step by step process until he saw how wrong he was. He said he didn't even realize how what he was doing was hurtful a lot of the time because he was so in his own head and had some really bad influences on the internet reinforcing his mindset. I can understand that and I love how far he's come.

Why didn't our parents intervene even though they always had my back? They did a lot of the time but most of what he said/did wasn't in their presence and I was not one to go running to them each time I was the victim of something. They are good people and I hold no animosity towards what they might have done instead.

I'm thinking about showing my brother this and the previous thread so he has a better understanding of how I felt about this and may update later on how that goes.

Also, I just want to say to others out there who feel they've been repeatedly wronged by someone to the point they want to cut them off that I know exactly how you feel. But the fact is people CAN change, if they want to. And even if they do, you're under no obligation to welcome them back in your life. But if you can find it in your heart, I'd strongly encourage you to give them a fair shot at doing so. People do fucked up things, sometimes many times or for many years before they they realize it and feel remorse. We're all only human<3",False,1586129348.0,2020-04-05 19:58:42
AITA for calling a pregnant woman a c***?,19236,Not the A-hole,80,d7rju6,1569193248.0,"I was at the bookstore the other day and as I approached the cash I saw a very angry and very pregnant woman who was visibly very upset. 

As I got closer I listened to her as she bombarded this teenage girl working the register. She was upset that a book that said it was in stock online wasn’t available at the store. She was complaining that she had wasted her time and energy by coming down to the store when the book wasn’t available. The girl at the cash was looking extremely uncomfortable and I could tell she felt bad. When the girl said there was nothing she could do, the pregnant woman started cussing at her and calling her stupid and a “inconsiderate little bitch”. As the girl was calling other stores to try and track down the book the woman looked at me and expected me to side with her said “what’s the point of customer service if they won’t help you?” 
At this point, I had felt horrible for the young girl and I knew I had to say something. So I looked at the woman and I said “I just hope whatever you give birth to isn’t a total c*** like his mom”. The woman looked at me in total shock and then started cussing at me telling me her husband was in the parking lot. I said I didn’t care and that she should just go to a different store because she was making everyone uncomfortable. She cussed and swore at me before calling her husband on her phone. He came in, didn’t say much (I’m 6’2, 210 pounds) and then convinced her to leave. As she left she flipped off the store and told me to fuck myself. 

Now, I still think sticking up for the girl was the right thing to do, but my friend that I was with told me it was inappropriate to call a pregnant woman the c word. I felt like if there was ever anyone who deserved the c word it was this woman. The cashier was using her hijab to wipe tears from her eyes after- the woman humiliated her. She thanked me by the way and her manager comforted her, so I think she’s ok. 

Ps, in the parking lot, the woman honked her horn and flipped me off as she drove by. 

I still feel it was the right thing to do, but is my friend right in saying I was wrong in using the c word?

EDIT: a few people have mentioned that I should not have included the hijab comment. It was not my intention to mention her religion for brownie points, I meant that it was very upsetting to see her trying to hide the fact she was crying because she was so embarrassed, and she didn’t even have the chance to get a Kleenex because this woman was just relentlessly going after her. Sorry if it came across as pandering. Was not my intention.

Wife and I both work as engineers and have dang good salaries to put it lightly, ex and new husband havent ever done particularly well.  

Ex wife didnt want me sending my son ""lavish"" gifts or taking him on the family vacations so her other siblings wouldnt get too jealous and build resentment towards him(her words).

Since then shits hit the fan with his mom/my ex though. shes PISSED how much hes getting and getting to do, keeps texting and calling both of us about how his younger siblings will never be able to get all he has and its not fair and now her kids are upset and how im a horrible dad for forcing his siblings to resent him.

I finally told her i dont care i want my kids to have a good life, and if she wants an adulterer hers would have a better life too.

AITA for not wanting to talk about my children that I lost in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami?,19231,Not the A-hole,1231,h8wnjg,1592180152.0,"In 2004, my family and I decided that over the Christmas period we’d go on vacation to Thailand. My husband had spent some time there as a child and really wanted to go back. I had two small children, a 4 year old girl and a 2 year old boy. We arrived on the 23rd of December and were due to go back on the 2nd of January. On the 26th, Boxing Day, a tsunami hit the resort we were staying in. I was upstairs in our hotel room when it hit, whilst my husband was with our children in the dining area. I prayed that my husband had our children whilst I fought for myself. 

My husband and I were reunited three days later, and he told me that the tsunami hit before he managed to grab our children. We stayed in Thailand for 4 months hoping our children were being kept somewhere with us presumed dead, but after searching pretty much everywhere, we presumed the worst and returned home which was the hardest thing we’ve ever done. 

I didn’t deal with the loss well, nor did my husband, and we ended up divorcing three years later. We couldn’t even look at pictures of the kids, and broke down just looking at each other. My family have always been as respectful as they can, apart from my mother. 

My mother and I have never had a good relationship. She was heavily addicted to drugs when I was born, and was in and out of my life until I was 15 when she sobered up. I was full of resentment and left the family home at 16 and we went about ten years without talking. 

Over the quarantine period, I have been staying with my sister and her family, and they also let my mom live with them. My mom will make dinners extremely uncomfortable for me by telling my nieces about the cousins they never got to meet, and how she felt when she found out, even though we weren’t talking at the time. 

Last night I finally snapped. We were sitting having dinner when my mom asked how my now ex husband is. I told her I don’t know, as I don’t, we haven’t spoken that often since we divorced. She asked if we’d still be together if the kids were alive, I asked how the fuck I was meant to know. She told me to stop being a bitch and I told her to stop bringing up my dead children. My nieces started getting upset because we were shouting, my sister told me to calm down as they’re all allowed to grieve too, which I completely disagree with. 

I left my sisters house and to a hotel not too far away because I seriously can’t take it anymore, but my sister has called multiple times telling me I’ve become a serious asshole since losing my children. AITA?",False,1592174137.0,2020-06-14 17:15:52
AITA for finally poking back at my childfree sister-in-law?,19186,Not the A-hole,1682,evbyg8,1580275727.0,"My wife's sister Abby is ""childfree.""  Neither my wife nor I could care less about whether Abby decides to have children, but over the years we have tolerated quite a bit of performative child-hating from her.  Calling children ""crotchfruit,"" talking about how dumb people are for becoming parents, and so on.

We had our first child last year and as a result she's been less outright rude about children but more bragging about how our lives are harder now and hers is free of responsibility. Stuff like ""I think I might go to Europe this summer.  I'll tell you about my trip for when you're able to go there in twenty years.""  Or talking about a concert she's going to go to, to which she says she'd thought about inviting her sister, ""but it starts at 9 o'clock and I'm sure you'll be in bed by then.""  You get the idea.

There have been lots of comments like this, but I've noticed that while Abby talks a big game, she never does seem to do any of the stuff she talks about.  She doesn't actually travel.  She doesn't ever seem to actually go to any of these concerts or shows or anything - whenever I ask her about them, she always tells some vague story about how she decided to skip it just this one time.  It seems to me like she likes the idea of having freedom more than she likes exercising that freedom.

She was over last weekend and had said something snarky about my kid so I was already kind of annoyed before she started talking at length about some TV show she'd been watching.  And I just couldn't help myself and said something to the effect of ""for a person with such a fun childfree lifestyle you sure do have a lot of Netflix recommendations.""

Anyway: she's really mad at me now.  AITA?

**EDIT:** OK, despite the top comment, there were enough ESH judgments in here that I went ahead and called her to apologize for being a dick.  She accepted it and admitted that she'd been pretty rude to us herself.  I have a lot more sympathy for her after this conversation - I don't think I understood quite how aggressively my mother-in-law pushed on both her daughters to provide grandchildren, and it seems likely that Abby has lashed out at us as a poor substitute for the things she wants to say to her mom.

AITA for hiding my personal life at work?,19075,Not the A-hole,3761,d66v6a,1568884859.0,"I'm in a little trouble at work because I've been sort of hiding my personal life. I've worked in this office for about nine years, working my way up. I'm notoriously private and also believe in a clear separation of work and home life. With that, I never, ever talk about home life. I'm not ashamed of my life I just don't like to discuss it at work. My coworkers enjoy talking about their personal lives and often include me. If I'm asked any questions I usually redirect or move on to someone else. In this manner, none of my coworkers knew I'm married, have twin daughters and a very active personal life.

We hired Melinda last year and she took it upon herself to become the office snoop. She spent several weeks getting as close to everyone as possible. However, she does this to seek out potentially useful information she can hold over peoples head. Try as she did, I never gave her anything. My coworkers view me as a sort of enigma. Compartmentalization aside, I've made some great friendships at work. There are more things to talk about than my husband and my kids. They are a big part of my life but I'm not even going to martyr myself and say they're the most important. They're hugely important and come before everything else but I'm not a sycophant and I enjoy the ten hours a day I'm at work when I get to be an adult and talk about things other than JoJo Siwa and the newest Jenndashian exploit.

Last week, Friday, Melinda came into work looking like the cat who got the goldfish. At lunch she announced to everyone that I am married with two daughters, a dog, and a nice house. I play softball, I kayak, and occasionally mountain climb and that I'm on Facebook. She couldn't see my posts however some of my photos are shared with others and therefore not private. I use a shortened version of my name (Ali from Alexandra) and my married name on FB so I'm not sure how she found me, unless she used WhitePages and put two and two together. I've already reported her to HR.

But the problem is, my coworkers are acting like this is a BFD. One of my friends said she's hurt that I don't trust any of them and hold them in ""such low regard"". I tried to explain that it's nothing against anyone, I just don't like discussing home at work and vice versa. I never bring work home. When I'm home that's time with my kids, or my dog, or my husband, or friends and hobbies. Heck, I chose to live an hour outside of the city in a small town just to avoid work when I'm not there. I've apologized if any feelings were hurt but my coworkers are now giving me the chill and won't talk to me unless it's directly about work. I honestly don't see the problem. I've never lied to them, I've never given them false info, I've never made up wild tales about my life. I'm still the same person I was, now they just know more about me than they did.

AITA?

ETA: I know this has been posted three times today. I didn't know Reddit was having trouble earlier with their servers and I thought it was the account I was posting from so I created a second throwaway and then a third because I never got confirmation the post was uploaded. I couldn't even get past the white screen with the little Reddit face spinning in the center. Those two posts actually have a little extra info in them. This one lacks the info because my patience wore thin.

ETA:  I don't have any sort of interesting update. HR brought us both in yesterday afternoon and asked us WTF is going on. I presented my side, as detailed above, Melinda gave her's: she basically said that she had been trying to get to know everyone and she had been having trouble getting to know me so she found my facebook in effort to find something to talk about with me and then she just informed everyone else. I asked my HR rep to pull up facebook and do a cursory search for my real name. There were several. Then I asked him to search my married name, or the one I go by on FB, ""Ali Smith"". There were enough for about six or seven scrolls on the mousepad. In any case, too many to count. I haven't touched my own page since I reported the incident. It was about thirty names from the top but like I said, my profile pic is my dog, not me, so she would have had to look a each thumbnail photo or view each account. I do have an Instagram page that's on private but I only have a few friends, mostly family members, under that same name. She found me night before last and friended me. Naturally I blocked her. HR gave her a reprimand for creating a negative work atmosphere. My rep wasn't sure why Melinda felt the need to blast my info for everyone and he called BS on her for claiming it was innocent. So that's that. That's probably all that's gonna come from it because my coworkers are now acting mostly back to normal. However, I took the advice from this sub and I'm making amends. They're all most receptive. I'm gonna learn to open up but not by much. But they know enough about me to know I'm not an automaton or anything.",False,1568969538.0,2019-09-19 02:20:59

AITA for laughing at my starstruck girlfriend?,19063,Asshole,4319,ffd129,1583705511.0,"Last year, my (22m) girlfriend (23f) won a radio contests to briefly meet and take a photo with one of her favorite kpop groups, NCT. She was super excited since I guess you would call her a superfan. I definitely feel like she's too old to put so much stock in kpop, but I generally don't talk to her about it, since it's pretty harmless, just annoying.

She was told that she could bring a plus one with her to the station to meet the band, and so she took me with her. Even in the car, she was so excited that she was shaking, and she kept saying that she wasn't sure she could do it. (I didn't care either way, I wanted it over with!) The meeting was honestly nothing special, all the band members said hi to her and shook her hand or offered her like a platonic hug. She cried for most of it (awkward) and kept bowing to the members (she's white) and while I didn't say anything, I was SO embarrassed for her. Some of the guys also shook my hand and greeted me, but a few of them didn't, probably noticing that I wasn't really into it. Whatever, it wasn't for me it was for her, I'm not a fan.

She has some other friends who are also kpop fans, and when we all hung out later, she started talking about how wonderful and surreal it was to meet her ""idols"". I then started laughing and telling her friends about how awkward she was, how she bowed to all of them despite none of them bowing to her, and made a joke about how they probably laughed at her once she was out of earshot. Complete silence, immediately everyone is death glaring at me. I try to clarify that she really was acting CRAZY for a 23 year old (I even looked up the band and half of them are teenagers!) and she retaliates that she probably made them feel less awkward than me, who didn't even talk to them. What the fuck, was I supposed to talk to a bunch of Korean guys I don't know? We ended up arguing about it privately but it's been a sore spot and we just don't bring it up. She barely even listens to kpop around me now.

Fast forward to now, a year-ish later. My girlfriend just bought 2 NCT tickets for her and her friend, which were very expensive and include YET ANOTHER fan meet. I mention buying a ticket myself so I can go along with them (not to the fanmeet though) and my girlfriend said she'd rather me not go because she doesn't want me to be bored or embarrassed. The way she said it was so cold, for absolutely no reason, and I feel like she's being so passive aggressive over a joke that I made AGES ago.

I was planned to land at 6:20 AM and had a job interview at my workplace at 9 AM so I really needed to get at least some sleep. First flight was kind of horrid and I managed to get barely any sleep, and I was kind of dreading the 2nd one already, but I get there and it’s just me and an older man with an empty middle seat in between. I’m quite tall so this worked perfectly as I could spread my legs and fall asleep nicely. However, flight attendant comes up to me and asks me if I would be open to giving up my seat so brother and sister can sit together (she said they’re young, don’t know how old). I asked where I’d be moving and she said “Miss, just follow me, I’ll show you everything”. So I thought for a second and realized that wherever she puts me it will be a worse deal than what I have now, and if it was any other situation, I would totally give my seat up, but I REALLY needed to get some rest, so I told her “I’m sorry, I will keep this seat”. She looked me in shock and said “But they are kids, they would like to sit together, it’s a long flight. Please come with me”, to which I replied “I get that, and I’m sorry, but I’ll stay here”. She got super annoyed and rolled her eyes, but tbh I was too tired and just drifted away.

AITA for ruining my brother in law's day with a purposeful fart?,19010,Not the A-hole,1411,hgkb2y,1593249452.0,"BIL and husband co own a house that was passed to them by their father. We live in one half while BIL lives in the other. The only thing we share is the living room and kitchen, the rest is completely separate. 

Lately BIL has been making odd comments about my ladylikeness. I am a down home back woods dirt under my fingernails still play in mud puddles basically wood rat of a woman. He's been cutting into hard labour chores I do and tells me he'll do it so I don't hurt myself/get dirty. He'll make positive comments when he sees me cleaning (lucky man!) and says things like ""I've never seen you cook! You should cook more!"" Note, he does not cook either. I like to look nice here and there. Whenever I do dress up and do makeup, BIL makes comments about how I should do it more often and I look super nice. He has said ""dressing up for husband?"" 

All of these I shut down with ""I do it when I feel like it,"" ""I'm doing it for me,"" etc. 

He is not a bad dude overall, hes actually a riot to hang out with, but it's little subtle things spread out and it digs at me as roommates do. Luckily we're moving soon. 

Anyways, yesterday I belched in the kitchen because I thought no one was around. BIL pops his head in and jokes ""have you ever thought about being more ladylike?"" Now the tone is joking but the word  ""ladylike"" is like my emotional tailgating car. Tailgating only makes the person in front slow down. Telling me to be ladylike makes me turn that shit way down. I have mad props to graceful and more traditional ladies if they like it, but I am not one! I say ""nope!"" and he replies ""you should consider it"" and leaves the room. 

So this morning, I'm walking by the living room, BIL is watching the morning news, and I decide to grace the room with a big long fart. This is the just woke up and shit is moving fart. It is the fart that has been building all night. It is loud, it has vibration, and even in the tiny room it echoes. I'd honestly give it a good 9/10 it was a damn masterpiece. 

I thought it was hilarious, immediately. BIL not so much. He proceeds to jump up and rage about how gross it was (fuck I've heard him blow out farts before) and how women shouldn't do that. Unfortunately by this time I am doubled over in tears because I can't stop remembering the fart and his rage has made it even funnier. He gets beyond mad and storms off to his bedroom. It's now 9pm and he is still enraged and hiding in his room. He says it was an asshole move (technically the truth?) 

At first husband thought it was funny too but now since it's upset his bro so bad he's leaning towards maybe it was too much and too immature and that I should have just told him that he was being overbearing. 

I feel like as a 37yo man, BIL should have known better than to think he can tell a grown woman how to behave. It probably would have been better to talk about it, but who pouts ALL DAY over a fart? 

So, am I the asshole for solving problems with an asshole?

Edit: you all are making me cry laughing again. I'm showing my husband and he's come around.

Edit 2: every single fart story is killing me, I feel a tenth of my age right now.

Edit 3: just woke up to this, combing through comments and loving it. BIL came to me when I went to go make coffee and said I made him feel uncomfortable in his own house. I told him it's my house too, and I've seen him do the same unashamedly. He made a couple ""but I'm a man"" comments and I called it out as sexist. He asked me how it was and I asked how it was NOT. After a few back and forths he started to understand that he is not my husband, this is my house too, and I do not and will not ever meet his southern standard for a woman. 

He wraps it up with ""... I guess it was kind of funny,"" and stalks off. I left a coffee peace offering in the living room, where he is enjoying saturday morning programming without a violent crop dust. We're all going to make dinner tonight and have a family make up with hopefully no dinnertable farts (I have SOME standards)

All in all, pretty damn good end result. And I bet I will never hear ""be ladylike"" from him again.

Avery has always been hostile towards me, and blamed me for his parents’ divorce, despite his dad not meeting me until three years after. I have tried my best to spend time with Avery, and I’ve been respectful of all the boundaries he set with me. Avery still hates me. It was fine with me, as long as he didn’t treat me like shit because he hates me.

Well, Avery started treating me like shit when he found out his dad was marrying me. He threw a fit, saying his dad needed his permission before marrying me, and that he wouldn’t come to the wedding. His dad and I let it slide, and sat down with Avery and Dianna to try and figure out why he was upset. It didn’t work, and Avery refused to see us until the wedding.

At Dave and I’s wedding, Avery objected to us being married in front of everyone, and asked to make a speech in front of everyone later in the night. In his ‘speech,’ he told everyone what a horrible person I was, and that I was responsible for his parents’ divorce, and that I was a dirty homewrecker. Dave drove Avery back to Dianna’s, but the damage was done, and several wedding guests assumed Avery was telling the truth. My wedding night was ruined because of this, and a good part of my family refuses to speak to me despite me explaining to them that this was not the case.

Avery has continued to treat me like shit since then. He got mad at me once, so he dropped my cat off at a shelter two towns over, and refused to tell me where he was until he’d been put down. I wanted to keep my wedding dress after the wedding, and he tore it to shreds. (Just two examples, I’ll give more if anyone wants them) 

Finally, Wednesday, Dave and I had Avery over for dinner because Avery actually wanted to come. Long story short, when I went to get dessert and Dave wasn’t there, Avery confronted me in the kitchen and began screaming at me and told me that I was a horrible person, as well as some other not-so-nice things. Dave eventually came in, Avery left, and I got pissed. I told Dave that I was tired of his son constantly attacking me and treating me like shit because of something he knows didn’t happen, and that I’d put up with his bullshit for the last six years. I told him that he had to make a choice between me and Avery, because I wasn’t putting up with Avery’s shit any longer, and if it was a requirement of being married to Dave, I’d be filing for divorce. Dave told me it wasn’t fair to make him make this decision, and I told him it might not have been fair, but it wasn’t fair of him to let his son harass and attack me for years.

AITA for refusing to let my overweight friend ride my horse?,18896,Not the A-hole,1644,gqgyqi,1590462036.0,"For background, i have 2 horses. Both are older (mid to late 20s), but one is very old (nearing 30), small (just above pony size and just under 1000 lbs) and has some back and hip issues. She is still in great shape for her age, is very muscular, and still enjoys riding. We trail ride up the mountains near our barn, usually 1.5-2 hours a ride, and they can be difficult and steep, but she does great with me (I am taller but weigh around 115 lbs). 

When I bring friends riding, they ride the smaller, older horse and I ride the younger one. This is because the younger horse is very sensitive and not beginner friendly whereas the older one is not sensitive and great for all levels of riding. Because of aforementioned issues, I am selective about who I let ride her as it’s difficult for her to carry too much weight, especially up the steep hills and for an extended period of time. 

I have a friend who is well over 200 lbs, does not know anything about horses, and asked to ride with me. I said no and was honest about why, but still offered for her to come groom them and spend time with them on the ground. She went straight to the body shaming tactic, I was skinny so I don’t understand, the horse is fine if she’s always galloping around with me, bigger people deserve to ride too, she’s shorter than me so it evens out, I’m gate keeping horses, etc. I just told her my horse was an animal with limitations, not a machine, and that I’m not going to sacrifice her welfare to spare her feelings. She was furious and we haven’t spoken since. Some friends (who all re also not into horses) think one ride would be fine and I’m being an asshole about her weight. I strongly disagree, I even agreed with her that bigger people can ride, they just need a horse suitable for their size and my horse is not that. So, AITA?

Edit: thanks for all the responses guys! This happened a few months ago, but it does get brought up from time
To time still so I was curious to see what this sub would think. 

I understand a similar story was posted not that long ago. That was not me, I just joined reddit this week and I’m sorry for the redundancy but I didn’t see that post beforehand.

Edit 2: I love sharing my horses with my friends and wish I had bigger, younger horses so I could take everyone riding! I have many friends who have never ridden before because of weight, some are in great shape and still too big for her, some are overweight and too big for her. Those friends have enjoyed coming to visit and loving on them on the ground, and that invitation was extended to this friend as well. She’s not too big to ride in general, she would just need a horse suitable for her and unfortunately neither of mine fit the bill.

My wife and I married young, at 23, and now at 27 she’s about to graduate from law school. The issue is she has a ton of student debt, around 195k from both undergrad and now law school.

But over the past year she’s completely changed her mind about law and becoming a lawyer. She now wants to teach and do Teach For America after graduating. She told me this past week. We’ve talked about this at length and she wants to do this because it’s her new dream job (previously it was law). 

I’m upset because if she teaches her starting salary will barely clear 35k in the first few years and we live in a really, really expensive city. She has no intention of going back into law later as well as she says law school was a mistake. 

Last night we were talking about the future and she mentioned our plans to have kids in a few years and how she’d like to be a stay at home mom in a few years as well. I looked at her and asked how she thinks we’re going to afford that when we’ve got nearly 200k in debt on my one income. She got mad and said I’m trying to use her debt to postpone major life events (like having kids). 

We ended up fighting and I told her she can’t just teach if she expects me to be saddled with her debt as a result. I said she should at least work a high paying job for a few years to repay a good portion. She said I’m prioritizing money over her happiness and that she’s disappointed in my lack of support when they would be my kids and my life as well.

AITA to tell her that if she chooses to go down this path, I may need to rethink our marriage? I haven’t said anything like this yet but I am thinking it.

AITA for attacking a muslim’s beliefs when she didn’t want to sit next to my brother and his friend on the plane?,18840,Not the A-hole,2677,d45gt0,1568498048.0,"Long time lurker, here is my first post!

So I (F16) was on a flight from Dubai to new York, so it was quite a long trip. Usually we are upgraded to business class on this airline since our dad is a pilot, but because my brother’s friend couldn’t afford the seat, we decided to stay in economy. Our mother was sitting in business class so she wasn’t present during this whole situation.

When we got on the plane, my twin brother and his friend, 16 and 15, were in the row in front of me, my brother in the window seat and his friend in the aisle. I was sitting right behind his friend in the aisle seat.

Then his woman got on, she was wearing a hijab, so it was obvious that she was a muslim. I saw her looking very uncomfortable when she saw my brother and his friend, knowing that she had the middle seat. 

I wasn’t paying attention but I took off my headphones when I heard my brother’s friend say no to the lady. She then said: “It is against my religion to touch men in public” and my brother said,

“But we’re not touching you.”

She looked very angry and was almost yelling at my brother’s friend to move to the middle seat so she could have the aisle. I thought she was so entitled, so I told them,

“Don’t move. Just ignore her.”

She then proceeded to ask me if I knew them, so I said yes. She asked to switch with me. So this is what I said,

“No. I don’t want the middle seat because I’m very claustrophobic (I’m not, I just prefer the aisle seat so I can stretch my legs)” and she said, 

“that’s not my problem.”

That’s when I got really pissed and I said it,

“Your religion is not our problem. Should’ve chosen better seats then” 

Then she stomped her foot and went to the flight attendant, and that’s the last we saw of her. I’m guessing they moved her to another empty seat. 

When we got back from the trip, my brother’s friend told me he was going to move and I wasn’t right to attack her religion like that.

WIBTA for getting my husband's cousin a Christmas gift that will definitely make him angry?,18829,Asshole,1751,edhedd,1576911013.0,"Hear me out.

He (cousin) is a flat earther. He also thinks that space isn't real and the stars are projected onto a screen or something. 

I want to get him a globe. I think it would be fucking hilarious. My friends all think it would be fucking hilarious. My husband says it's up to me. I haven't asked my in laws what they think yet, they will probably tell me no because they are the type of people to never rock the boat. Cousin will be sooooooo pissed, but I think it would be incredibly worth it.

The rest of the in laws are engineers and other sciencey types, this cousin is just a ""conspiritard"" who listens to way too much Alex Jones.

I think that a getting him a globe would just be a bit of harmless fun, but if this is too harsh, a friend of mine also suggested that I get a globe for my husband and just make sure that cousin is present when husband opens it.

I await your judgement, reddit.

Edit: I won't do it. No point in creating drama for no reason. Even if said drama is hilarious.

"AITA for leaving my GF upstairs crying to play poker with ""the boys"" downstairs?",18824,Not the A-hole,2152,fb0y6k,1582950151.0,"A little bit ago, it was my birthday, and my girlfriend had planned out a whole thing for me.

Some background was that I totally *nailed* her last birthday.
We spent the whole day doing her favorite things, had dinner at her favorite restaurant, got a big dessert of her favorite cake, and went back to my place to find... a huge surprise party.
(Gonna go ahead and congratulate myself again because I totally fucking nailed it for her).

I knew that she would try to top it for my birthday, but I really didn't want it.
I don't like making a big deal of my birthday, so just having a beer with my friends is good enough.
I also don't want to be mean, but she's really not that great at planning things.

Unfortunately, she still decided to plan something.

The first part was great.
We went with some of our mutual friends (not my close friends, but good enough) to an escape room and had a great time.
However, afterward, she got really upset when they left and started crying.
When I asked why, it was because everyone had bailed on the second part of her plan: to go drinking on a raft in a nearby body of water.

Now, I should say again that it's winter, and it was raining that day.
The whole idea was pretty bad and *I* didn't want to do it (not that I said that, of course).

We went back to my place, where I found out that my closest friends had planned a poker night for me.
My GF tried arguing with them because she ""knows me better"", but I really wanted to play poker with them.
Apparently she had known that they were planning this, and had tried to keep me away from my house because she wanted the day to be about ""us"".

I was kinda pissed, even though she *had* spent a lot of time planning things for me and we had had fun at the escape room, so I comforted her for a bit, and went downstairs to play poker for the rest of the night.

Now she and her friends are angry with me, because I ""abandoned"" her when she was upset. AITA?

Edit: Clearing some things up:

- That last bit in the paragraph about my girlfriend's birthday was a failed attempt at humor.
Looks like it was a bit hit or miss in the comments, but it was dumb of me to write that.

- My roommate let my friends in for poker.
Big mystery solved.

- This happened around 10 PM (as I've stated in the comments).
I tried to get my girlfriend to play poker with everyone but she refused.

- I guess I didn't say clearly, but I did talk about birthday plans with my girlfriend and asked that they be kept to a minimum.",False,1582964768.0,2020-02-28 20:22:31
AITA for going to a nice restaurant with my wife and sharing a meal?,18822,Not the A-hole,3659,du19w9,1573360220.0,"My wife and I are not from the US but we have lived here for the last 2 years. On a friday or saturday once a month we will try a nice restaurant that we have not been to before in our city. However since we are not used to American portion sizes so we usually order much less food than what is considered normal.

When we go to a restaurant we will usually order an appetizer and main course and share both. We will also usually have one or two glasses of wine each, or sometimes we will share a bottle if we feel like it. However occasionally when the appetizer is large we just share the appetizer instead of ordering a main course.

Last night we went to a new restaurant that is considered a quite nice restaurant in the city ($20-30 per main course). When they brought out the appetizer it was very large so we shared it and we were definitely full so we didn't order a main course. We were also planning on having some wine later that night at home so we only had one glass of sparkling wine each.

When we asked for the bill, the waiter was shocked. He asked if we wanted anything else and we kindly said no but that the appetizer was delicious. After around 5 minutes we still didn't get the bill, but after close to 10 minutes either the owner or manager (don't know who he was) came up to us and gave us the bill and he said something like ""this is a ~~full~~ full service restaurant, you cannot just come in here and order an appetizer and leave"". He gave us the bill and asked us to never come back to the restaurant.

AITA here? This seems so foreign to me. We still ordered food and drinks, why are we less welcome than any other group? It shouldn't matter that it is a full service restaurant, people have different appetites.

Today at 12 I had to give a presentation about how our team is handling the crisis, and then give a proposal about a new product design. This was given to my boss, and the VP of engineering. It’s probably the most important meeting I’ve had in months, which isn’t really saying that much since most of them are useless but this one was actually important.

I told my wife beforehand about it, and reminded her this morning. Then half way through she comes in with my son crying, hands him to me, and just leaves. She not only left the room, but she left the house and didn’t take her phone. She didn’t come home for 4 hours.

This threw the whole pace of the meeting off, I had to put him in his crib, and then had to keep an eye on him. Additionally it stressed me out in the middle of an already stressful meeting, to my less than understanding boss.

Suffice to say I was pretty fucking pissed off. When she got back I yelled at her that she can’t just disappear for 4 hours without her phone, and that she interrupted something I told her not to beforehand. 

She then said she “needed a break”, and I told her if she needed a break she could watch tv and zone out like a normal fucking human being instead of fucking off to god knows where leaving me stuck between a new born and a judgmental boss. 

She got pissed off and said that I should be more understanding and that she’s doing more work than me. That also pissed me off, because she absolutely isn’t doing more work then me, she doesn’t even have a fucking job. She said she was going to stay at her moms, again leaving me alone with my son during work tomorrow.

AITA?

Edit: since people assume I do nothing around the house:


Okay, perhaps I didn’t want to make a giant fucking list of chores, but clearly it’s necessary.

I cook 5/7 days a week, 7/7 now that we can’t get takeout in good conscious. She doesn’t know how. I do the dishes because I cook. I vacuum and take out the garbage. I clean the bathrooms. The only thing she does is take care of our son.

AITA for not wanting to give my new stepdaughter fine silverware that my mom promised to my daughter?,18798,Not the A-hole,1614,f6rx0o,1582227883.0,"My mom passed away some years ago. She was by no means a rich lady but she held onto treasures in the way people from the old days did. 

She had a beautiful antique set of silverware that I admired as a little girl, and that my own daughter loved to look at when we went to visit my mom. My mom promised her she would have it one day. 

Before my mom passed she gifted the silverware to me on the proviso that it went to my daughter when she is old enough. Of course I agreed and it’s stayed in my home since since my daughter wants me to give them to her when she first buys her own home, so obviously a few years away still. 

Since my moms death life has changed for me- I remarried in 2018, my daughter is all grown up at 19, and I have inherited a lovely stepdaughter who is in her 30’s. 

She asked me if she could use the silverware for her wedding this past July, I was uneasy only because the thought of it being stolen etc was on my mind. However her ceremony was very small and intimate so ultimately I changed my mind after asking my daughter her thoughts since ultimately it’s her silverware. 

After her wedding she was asked me repeatedly if she can share the set of silverware with my daughter. She fell in love with it and now has sentimental value to her. I do like my stepdaughter but it’s not my gift to give away, I’m simply holding on to it for my daughter. 

I told her to ask my daughter, my daughter said no. She said it politely. My stepdaughter thinks I am excluding her because she should enjoy this also. I said it’s not my place or my gift to split.

(They 6h away). We said sure, love to see you. Friday afternoon, I (34F) had an ultrasound for my 8 week pregnancy. The ultrasound showed a likely miscarriage. My husband (35M) & I were upset, but as my bro & SIL were already driving, we didn't cancel the visit. We hadn't told them about the pregnancy, nor had we told our 3 kids.

When bro & SIL arrive they were excited to tell us SIL is pregnant, and due 2 weeks before I would have been due. I tried to sound excited and happy for them but I wasn't as excited as I normally would have been. Then it turned into a nightmare.

She didn't like supper; so we ordered in food for her. She needed the bed moved from 1 wall to another. Fine. She insisted on 5 pillows to sleep. I found a couple & she was upset I couldn't give her more & asked if she could go into the kids rooms and take theirs. I said no.

Next morning, she freaked out at 7 am that the kids were eating cereal too loud. She spent the morning curled up on the couch complaining about morning sickness. I  sympathized and said it's awful, but it will go away. She screamed ""No, you've never experienced this- they gave me the same anti-nauseau drugs they give chemo patients so shut up!"" I got quiet. My husband was making brunch and she freaked out that he was going to cook bacon because ""the smell makes me vomit."" We didn't make bacon. She also didn't want us to make eggs or let the kids have syrup on their pancakes. I refused, so she stormed off into her room until mid- afternoon. 

Midafternoon she decides to go shopping and said they'd be back for dinner. We said dinner would be at 5:30. At 5:45 they hadn't show up, and weren't replying to texts, so we ate. They showed up at 6 and she freaked out that we hadn't waited so we ordered pizza. She spent the next two hours complaining about how brutal pregnancy is and how it sucks so much and how she's never going through it again. I lost it & told her that I was in the middle of a miscarriage and I'd love to have her problems because it means my baby would be ok. Everything got quiet and she looked at me and said ""I can't believe you'd use the ""M"" (miscarriage) word around me. That's bad luck, and if I lose the baby it's your fault!"" and went to her room and slammed the door. About 15 min later she said ""I'm glad you lost your baby. You already have 3, and if you had one right now, you'd just be trying to upstage me. I'm glad your baby is dead.""

I burst into tears, and my husband told her to get out. He said ""I've watched you complain, whine and bitch all weekend. We stayed quiet about what was going on with us because we though you deserved a chance to enjoy sharing your news. But this is enough. Get out now.""

AITA for refusing to stop having a relationship with my bio daughter because my girlfriend is uncomfortable?,18761,Not the A-hole,2235,h95hn0,1592210448.0,"I’ve known my best friend Brenda since we were kids. I was the first person she came out to as a lesbian when we were in our senior year of highschool and fully supported her. 

She met her current wife in college and they got married 6 years later. When I was 27, they both talked to me about wanting to start a family. They asked if I would consider being their sperm donor because they wanted someone they trusted rather than a stranger and who’d be there when their child started to have questions about their donor.

I was honored that they thought of me and agreed to do it. It felt good to help people I care about start their own family. We went through the whole process and a year later, Brenda gave birth to their daughter, Lucy (after Lucy Lawless of course, haha)

Since she was born, I’ve always been present in her life and we have a great uncle/niece type relationship. The 3 of us have been happy with how things are and they’re glad I’m close with Lucy. She’s already been told of how she came into the world (w/o the full details) and while she knows I “helped” build their family, I’m still Uncle Steven to her. 

3yrs after she was born, I began dating my girlfriend. I didn’t tell her about Lucy til 4 months in and it took her time to process this but she eventually came around.

We’ve been together 3 years now and planning on getting married. Last week was Lucy’s 6th b-day and we both were at their house. After cake was cut, we all started taking pics. I told my gf to come so we both could get one with Lucy but she said no. Didn’t think nothing of it until I noticed she was distant and hardly interacting with anyone.

We talked after we got home and she said she didn’t feel comfortable with me seeing Lucy anymore because it still felt weird that I donated sperm and now I’m playing a role in her life when donors don’t do that. This was a shock to me because she never brought it up before. When I said I wasn’t gonna stop, she got frustrated and it became a huge fight. She didn’t understand why I had to be in Lucy’s life and it felt unfair that she has to share me with someone who’s not my legal responsibility. 

At one point she asked if Brenda & I slept together and came up with this donor idea to cover the fact that I knocked her up, and that’s why I’m involved. I get we were both angry but asking that was out of line. I told her I’ll never cut off my relationship with them and left our apartment.
She’s still been trying to convince me for days and to also consider her feelings in all this. 
 
To her, it’s unreasonable to choose a kid that’ll never truly be mine over her: someone I can have a future and a family with. I feel bad that she feels this way, but it seems like she’s not being fair either. It’s been rough and I don’t know who’s right or wrong.

Back when I was 18 I went abroad for uni and I started getting taller slowly at first, I was about 5'5 when I left and slowly after about 7 months I was 5'10. I went to the Dr in the country I was studying in and they assured me I was in puberty still and I'm just getting taller. I went home for the summer and everyone was surprised that I'm like a normal height now and it was nice being taller. I had no medical symptoms so didn't go to the Dr in my country since I was healthy. I was still growing slightly and I was around 6ft tall when I left back to go abroad for school in the fall.

Once I got back to school I started having a lot of migraines and dizzyness etc. It was pretty mild so I stupidly ignored it for a few months but I was still growing and about 6'2 by the winter. I went to a large hospital near my uni instead and they gave me a brain scan and MRI and they discovered I had a smallish tumor on my pituitary glad and this was causing my symptoms and crazy height gain. The tumor was stimulating the gland to release high amounts of HGH. I flew back home ASAP and my parents took me to the hospital and thankfully it was benign and it was removed easily. So after all that I'm 6'3.5 after about 2 yrs of having this tumor while both my parents are 5'3. So I was destined to be short and all my kids probably were too.

I met my GF last year and I basically have no health problems from it, I just go in for check ups on my hormones and a brain scan every 6 months. I told my GF that I had a brain tumor but it wasn't a big deal and she didn't care too much about it since we dealt with it. I didn't tell her it caused me to get tall because idk she never asked and none of my friends or family cared and no one talks about it.

She found a picture of me at my prom and I looked really short and she was like wow you grew so much and I told her ya its because of that tumor I told you about. She was surprised and asked more about it so I non chalantly told her what happened and how I would have been 5'5 if it didn't.

To my surprise she got mad and said that I was lying to her about my height and that if we had kids they would be short since everyone in my family is. Which is true my genes didn't change, my kids would probably also be short. Called me a huge asshole and has been distant with me for a couple of days.

For context she's 5'6

\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\*\*

For everyone messaging me asking if my dick got bigger during this the answer is yes it did. But the doctors I saw all agree that it was because I was still in the latter stages of puberty still (late bloomer). But its still in the average range, just in the higher part of that range now lol.

We've been married almost 39 years. Yes, we got married at 17 and 19. Our daughter was a surprise late in life pregnancy when I was 49. For some reason, I've always looked much younger than my age. I'm usually estimated to be in my early to mid thirties. Gets annoying at times now, but it's okay. My grandmother was the same way. My husband looks his age. I worry about the severe generation gap and finding friends with similarly aged kids, so I try to keep up with younger pop culture and technology.

We signed our daughter up for soccer this year. We were at our daughter's soccer practice last Saturday, and a mom came up to me when my husband was off getting coffee. We talked, which went well. When my husband came back, she went stone cold and excused herself.

All this week, this woman has launched a campaign against me and my entire family. She thinks my husband and I have a 30-40 year age difference, which is ""inappropriate"". She thinks our relationship is based on money (?!), that it ""sets a bad example for young girls"" and I especially should ""think about what my daughter is learning"". The team parents were starting to be against me, and I needed to respond.

I was infuriated by all of this. I try to keep a mentality of ""age only means what you let it"" and care for my appearance and stay more modern, but I wouldn't think I'm trophy wife level. I sent a mass email with what I think is a toned down reaction to this woman's judgement and three things: my wedding announcement from 1981, my daughter birth announcement (which showed our ages), and a picture of me heavily pregnant, with my husband, at my 50th birthday party.

The woman was humiliated in front of all of the parents on the team, so much so that she had to leave because they all refused to work with her at all. Her child has special needs, and this is one of the most inclusive teams. Many of the leagues around won't allow special needs children because they ""can't accommodate"". I feel bad that now her child can't experience sports, but maybe she earned it? We're not leaving this one because it is more accepting of non-traditional families and works best with our schedule.

Edit: We married so young because we both had very...harsh homes and were in love (still are!). At the time, marriage meant automatic emancipation and you had better economic chances pairing up.

AITA for Having Professional Hair and Makeup for a Wedding When the Bride Didn’t,18668,Not the A-hole,2416,d6elil,1568931059.0,"Hi, y’all.

My brother (m40) and his wife (f35) got married on Sunday. I (f22) am pretty close with my brother, but not his wife, so while I was a guest, I wasn’t in the bridal party. 

They got married at a somewhat local mansion, which is actually pretty affordable for a wedding venue. The dress code on the invitation was “formal.” For the three weddings I’ve been to with formal dress codes (and the eight I’ve been to semi-formal dress codes), the implication was always that it meant professional hair and makeup. That is how *my* whole family took the dress code, so we all coordinated appointments. A few of us actually went together and had a makeup artist from a few towns over come in, so my SIL could hire locally. 

Well, when we got there,  her family looked good, but their hair and makeup were clearly not professionally done. When her bridesmaids came out, it was apparent they hadn’t used a professional either, nor had she. 

It was kind of awkward in pictures, but I didn’t really see a big deal.

Well, yesterday, I got a barrage of messages from the bridal party, her mother, and the bride herself about my family trying to “upstage her” and that sort of thing. Quite a few other relatives got the messages too, including my grandmomma. (FYI, my brother thought I looked pretty and didn’t see an issue except “when did you become a woman?”)

I’ve tried explaining that it was a miscommunication, but they’re having none of it. Was I really a bitch?

I(37F) made fancy cookies for a friend’s birthday this past week. The amount of planning that went into these cookies was silly TBH. Slowly but surely I collected the ingredients I needed through annoying ass grocery and amazon orders and miraculously had everything I needed to make these cookies on time for my BFF’s birthday.  Baking them was also a hassle - I had to bake them in small batches in order to correct the dough until I got the perfect cookie. So I’m running back and forth to the kitchen for hours while also taking care of my 10 month old son. I made extra cookies because my hubby has a sweet tooth. 

Hubby (38M) comes home from work and is super excited that I made cookies. I tell him how hard I’ve been working on these tricky ass cookies and tell him very specifically that there are 6 cookies that he must not eat that are perfect in size and shape and decoration and will be given to my BFF.  I TELL HIM THIS TWICE because I can’t stand the thought of having to deal with more cookie decorating. I even separated the ‘off limit’ cookies from the rest so it’s obvious which ones are not meant for him. He nods in acknowledgement. That evening he’s back and forth, in and out of the kitchen eating cookies (getting chocolate on the fucking sofa as he eats them) At some point I check on the perfect 6 gift cookies to see if the decorations have set and - what’s this?! One of the 6 quarantined cookies is missing! 

I asked hubby why he ate one of the special cookies and he laughed. ‘Oh honey the other cookies were too big and I just wanted one last small cookie’. I was only a little mad at first but kind of shocked.  ‘I told him ‘I can’t believe you just did that when I asked you not to twice! WTF dude?’

His reaction ‘It’s not a big deal sweetie. Are you really going to get upset over a cookie? There are so many cookies left, just use one of the others. Or give her 5 instead of 6.’

At that point I got a little more angry.  I told him that I wanted an apology and that he was being inconsiderate.  He rolled his eyes at me and apologized sarcastically and muttered that he would sleep on the couch tonight ‘because we’re arguing about cookies now.’ He said I was being immature for arguing with him about cookies. He gives me the silent treatment for the rest of the night and slept on the chocolate stained sofa. 

Now I’m fucking pissed and confused. Am I an asshole because I made a big deal out of this stupid cookie situation?

I was telling her and my mom about the school rule and they thought it was silly too. My doctor was talking about how unhealthy it was to not let kids drink water all day, and sell them sugary sodas at lunch 

I asked if she'd sign a doctor's note allowing me a water bottle and she said od course. So I printed out the form and she signed it. There was a section saying to describe the medical need and she wrote ""water is necessary for life"" which my  mom thought was funny but also thought might get the note rejected, like it was obviously meant for specific medical conditions or disabilities. 

But she said that if anyone had a problem with it, to have them call her and they'd get a piece of her mind.

So I took the note to school and a bunch of teachers told me I couldn't have a water bottle and I said I had a note. Most of them didn't read it closely enough to see the reson but out of the two that did, one laughed about it and asked if it was real. I said it was, she could call the number on the form. She seemed satisfied.

The other teacher threatened to take the note away, saying medical exemptions were not a joke, it was a disrespectful thing to do, disrespectful to the school's rules and disrespectful to people who had an actual medical need, to treat it as a joke.

I know my doctor hadn't meant it as a joke about actual medical problems...

AITA for bringing a sassy doctor's note to school? It said my medical need to be allowed to have a water bottle was ""water is necessary for life""",False,False,2020-02-10 19:08:54
AITA for contesting an entire will to avoid a clause I didn't agree with?,18653,Not the A-hole,2326,f7d1as,1582329230.0,"Using a throwaway. I am the only child of my parents. They set their will up to have me inherit about 70% of their estate, with the stipulation that I donate/tithe 10% of my portion to their church. My parents' siblings had the rest divided among them. 

Here's the thing: I don't view churches to be a worthy cause to give to in general. I actually view it to be unethical to make the churches richer while actual worthy causes suffer. Beyond that, that particular church had a horrible effect on my childhood that I'm still working through as an adult. I can't on moral or ethical grounds give money to my abusers. 

They had another clause where if someone contests the will, everyone's portion gets tied up in court and it's very possible that no-one gets anything. My case extended legal proceedings for almost 9 months longer than it would have been, but I was able to argue and win that the church could be substituted for any non profit charity. I chose Planned Parenthood, RAINN, and Saving Our Sisters, the three organizations that I felt best counteracted the religion I was raised in, and split 25% (15% extra) of my inheritance between them. 

I've been getting flak from all of my extended family, who say that I should have honoured my parents last wishes and not dragged everyone through months of court because I ""couldn't control my emotions"". I don't agree, and I honestly couldn't live with myself having given a single dime to a religious group or religious institution. I would have forfeited the entire thing if I had to to not do it.

Edit: The legal proceedings have since ended. The reason that they set the will up that way was that they wanted me to personally have to sign the check to the church in an effort to draw me in. I didn't realize this wasn't obvious.",False,1582303260.0,2020-02-21 15:53:50

AITA for shutting down the electric to my moms house after finding out she had used my social security without my knowing?,18509,Not the A-hole,1813,eksd4l,1578335472.0,"Unknowingly to me (M20) for the past two years my mom has been using my social security number to open an account with an electric company and since she opened it she hasn’t paid one bill, racking up over 5400 USD in debt under my name. 

I only found out about the bill after I went to check the mail christmas day and saw mail from the company to me. She had hidden it from me for over two years. 

I was furious and panicked because I’m supposed to be getting married, I’m in college, and already it felt as though my life was already hitting a block, and now I wasn’t even going to be able to put the power for my own house under my name and my credit would be down the drain if I didn’t do something about it. So I texted my mom asking about it, I tried to be respectful about it, but she threw a fit, yelled at me, and immediately tried to turn the tables on me. She had tried saying that I told her she could use my name, but even if I did, (which I know I didn’t because I would remember something like this) it’s the fact she didn’t pay a penny for two years, since she opened the account. She said things to me like I ruined Christmas, how terrible I am treating her, I don’t appreciate anything she does for me, and tried holding college over my head saying she isn’t going to help me do anything, or pay anything for my college if I try to do anything about the electric. Some of the things were so bad that my fiancé said I should delete the messages so I don’t have to look at them whenever I get on my phone.

After much thought and consideration, I decided to shut the power off, I gave my mom some time to figure something else out for the power to the house and I’m not sure if she thinks I’m serious or not but I intend on closing the account. She now has basically disowned me, and after talking to my little brother, (He’s 18), I heard how she tried turning my siblings against me, telling them how terrible I am and twisting the situation in favor of her. 

My friends think I should sue her, but as my mother I don’t think I could bring myself to do it,  I told her I’ll take the debt on but I’m not letting the account stay open.



Edit: Hey all, thanks for the Santa’s last ride. I noticed a lot of comments on this, I want to get to them all and try to read them all. As of now there’s a few questions about why it wasn’t shut off earlier and accrued so much debt,  to be honest, I’m not sure, I called the company and they transferred me to a few different departments such as payments, billing, account services, etc. but most of the workers there said they aren’t sure either and they’re going to look into it and let me know what comes up. As things progress I’ll update this in the future and if anyone is curious as to what happens you can check back. Thank you all for any advice and support given and I’m taking it all into consideration. I can’t let this just slide, the consequences would be too dire.",False,1578366068.0,2020-01-06 10:31:12
AITA for firing my sister after seeing her blog and not rehiring her without an apology?,18467,Not the A-hole,1170,gseuad,1590728822.0,"Basically what happened is read my sisters blog. It was sent to me by a friend of mine who was asking if one of the “characters” was me. Spoiler alert, it was me.

Its couple years old and really popular. She doesn’t use our family’s real names but they are very similar and use the same first letter. So think real names: Katy, Julia, Marissa and Brad then the fake names being: Kathy, June, Marnie and Bob.

It’s descriptive enough of our lives and what we do for work that my friend identified me from it.

Its mostly about her and her life but there is still a lot about us.

A year ago I had an abortion. It was during the lowest point in my life so far and only she and my husband knew about it. She swore to me that she would take the secret to her grave. Yeah, she dedicated a whole entry to it.

A couple months ago she and her husband got laid off due to world events. I run my own business that wasn’t really affected and I offered her a job there to help her out. She’s not qualified in my field so I essentially made up a position for her so she could have a steady paycheck. She basically does data entry and other random tasks online from her home.

Her blog since then has basically centred on how much she hates it. She called it demeaning work and says a bunch of bullshit about how I obviously don’t respect her intelligence. I say this is bullshit because 1. She would need years of training to work any of the open positions 2. I told her what she would do when I offered it and she gushed about how grateful she was and that I was really helping her.

I called her and told her what I had read and how hurt I was. Her defence is that the blog is her online diary where she vents and that I should know not to take any of it personally. She actually had the gall to tell me that she is hurt that I read it! Apparently the right thing to do was ignore it??

I told her off for telling the internet my secrets and dragging me online where I could be, AND WAS, found by people who know me. She just said she did all her due-diligence by changing the names and it wasn’t her fault my friend found it.

We argued for a bit, it got increasingly heated, and I fired her. I told her that if she couldn’t apologize or see how she was wrong here, then she wasn’t who I thought she is and she could find a job where she felt more respected.

It’s been a week and I haven’t spoken to her at all. Her husband has been contacting me on her behalf trying to get her job back as they need the money. He claims she is sorry but I think if she was, then she could tell me herself.

My own husband is telling me I am overreacting and that she’s family and I should just forget it. I don’t agree.

Am I the asshole here?

TLDR: Sister drags me and reveals my secrets on her blog and I fire her, am I the asshole?

EDIT/UPDATE: After reading a lot of the response I have become more and more sickened by this situation. I sent my sister an email detailing how much damage this is doing to me emotionally and could do to me financially and professionally. In the email I am asking her to delete all entries in her blog that include private details about me, my business or our family.

I am giving her an ultimatum. She can do as I asked, delete the entries, and I will consider it water under the bridge. We can move on with our lives and try to repair our relationship.

OR

She can continue to ignore me, keep her blog, and can consider me out of her life. We can see each other at family events and keep things civil but I will no longer share my life with her. She wont be an aunt to my future children or a real sister to me.

Ill update if and when she responds.

EDIT/UPDATE 2: She replied to my email asking me to facetime her tomorrow. She wants to talk to me after we both have had the night to cool down. I agree with her as I am pretty heated right now.

Will update after our talk. Thank you everyone for the support, has really opened my eyes to the gravity of the situation.

FINAL UPDATE:

I talked to my sister early this morning. We had a really productive conversation! I won’t go into too much detail since it was a long and emotional call.

The reason she had not reached out during the week we weren’t talking was a bit surprising. It turns out her husband knew about the blog but had never read it at her request. After our blow up he wanted to see what had made me so upset. She allowed him to read some of the entries and he ended up siding with me. There was also some information on him and his family that he was upset about so they were having a separate fight about that.

I guess my email to her put into perspective to her how much damage her blog and the information she shared there could affect others. She showed me over the videochat that she actually deleted the whole thing. She told me that the blogging started out as a place to vent, but when it got more popular people started emailing her asking for updates on certain “characters” (ie her family) and she started seeing hundreds of comments. She became obsessed with it basically.

She apologized for sharing my secrets and for being ungrateful about the job. She claims that she was exaggerating in the blog to get more views and likes and I can see that. 

Our relationship is damaged but not beyond repair. She is not coming back to work for me, instead I am just sending them a small amount of money to help cover their rent. It not as much as she was making but I really do love her and I still want to help her. Once one of them gets a job they will get back on their feet. This way they at least have less stress.

Once things start to reopen in our area she promised to set up a regular therapy appointment where she can vent all she wants and get actual advice. As well as help for what she described as a “blogging addiction”.

I want to thank everyone for the comments. Some of them were harsh and some of them were crazy but it helped a lot to figure out how I actually felt about the situation

"AITA for going to the gym during ""women's hour""?",18437,Not the A-hole,3646,faptbq,1582896530.0,"I recently moved into this particular apartment complex because its a lot closer to my work and it has a pretty spectacular gym. The gym fees are built into my monthly rent payment, about $40 and is optional. I elected to pay it because I'm an avid gym-goer. I've been going to the gym at my usual time of around 6:30ish and at first I was oblivious to the fact that during the times that I go, its all women - who usually give me pretty dirty looks but I thought nothing of it. I made a friend in my complex and when she saw me at the gym she was super surprised to see me. Unbeknownst to me, there is a women's hour every weekday from 6p-9p. Now look. I know that us dudes can be big creeps and it can be annoying for a woman to try to get off a workout in peace. But I think that 3 hours is far too excessive. I ended up leaving that day to keep the peace though.

Those times make it incompatible for me to go the gym which is open 6a - midnight. I work 8:30a to 5:00p and I usually come home at around 5:30ish, depending on traffic. Usually I like to chill for about half an hour after getting home to decompress and I either make food for later or just browse the twitter or reddit. Now I know that I could wake up early to go....but imma be real honest and say that I'd rather not do that because I like my sleep. What makes it even worse is that the nearest gym is a 40!!!!!! minute drive away. Which is a no bueno for me.

So I thought about it and escalated this matter to the strata manager and I asked her about the women's hour because I was not informed of this prior to signing my lease. Apparently its not a policy instituted by the strata, but the tenants (who are mostly women) agreed on this policy as a community and the strata neither endorses nor discourages this policy. I was prepared to give up and make do with the other gym but first I inquired about getting my monthly gym fee waived if I won't be going there. Strata manager said that she can't do that until my lease is up for renewal in a year. So I said eff that, I won't be paying for a service that I won't use.

So I go to the gym. I make sure to go out of my way to not look at or talk to any of the women there because I want to leave them alone, and vice versa. I just work out and keep my head down.

Today one woman tapped me on the arm (more like hit me if i'm being real) and said ""you know it's women's hour right"" and I said yeah I know that but the window makes it pretty much impossible for me to work out at other times so I have to go now. Oh and please don't touch me. She got pissed and told me to get out. I refused and ignored her and continued my workout whilst all the other women gave me extremely dirty looks. AITA?

Edit: wow I woke up and didn't expect to see this blow up. just to answer a few questions: some people have asked why the nearest gym is so far away - this is because I live in a town that's a satellite town of a major metro area. think Mississauga or Abbotsford or something like that

Some have also asked why I don't talk to the women in there. that's because I agree with women's hour in the sense that I do believe they need their own time to workout, I just heavily disagree with the manner in which they're doing it. so Im not going to the gym to talk to anybody....Im just going to workout. I really make an effort and go above and beyond to not appear as if Im ""creeping"" on these women, like I said I just go and keep my head down.

I suppose I could try to get the policy changed but, again, the overwhelming majority of tenants are women (it was the strata manager that told me this). so I would imagine I'd have a hard time getting my voice heard. You know what, now I know how women feel like when they're in a job or something in which they're overwhelmingly the minority in gender, it can kind of suck.",True,1582908636.0,2020-02-28 05:28:50
AITA for proposing to my boyfriend as a woman?,18430,No A-holes here,3117,e4c83s,1575210213.0,"So my boyfriend(now fiancé) and I have been together for 5 years. He’s great, and I love him. We had discussed getting married before a little bit and both said we wanted to, but didn’t really say when. 

Both our families were away for thanksgiving so we decided to take a little vacation, we went to sequoia national park and I thought that it would be the perfect place to propose. I already bought him a really nice watch (he wears one but it’s sort of cheap), and when we were in this beautiful little clearing with the huge trees and no one was around I popped the question, got down on one knee and all.

He was really surprised and didn’t exactly react the way I expected, he seemed sort of annoyed and upset but eventually said yes. On the drive home he said that it made him upset that I would just propose and that it was “a mans part of a marriage” and “something he was looking forward to his whole life”. So now I feel really awful because I thought it would be really sweet if we reversed the roles because he’s always doing romantic things for me.

Anyway he was sort of cold when we got home, not outwardly aggressive but now I’m just sitting here worried if I did something horribly wrong.

AITA?

Edit: Jesus I didn’t expect this many comments. I see a bunch of people talking about how he lost his chance when he waited 5 years, but I’m only 27 and he’s 28, so we were in college and grad school for much of the relationship. He was getting his PhD and was busy and I got my masters and started my job and he was still in school. We had this conversation maybe 4 months ago? So it’s not like he’s had years.

I’m planning on talking to him about it when he wakes up. But I don’t really appreciate the “your marriage is doomed” comments

Update: I figured I’d update since some of the comments were actually very helpful, despite a few suspect pms. I talked to him earlier, and he apologized for getting upset, I apologized for making him upset and we made up, and then he pulled out an engagement ring for me and proposed back.

AITA for not teaching a skill to my oldest son that I taught his siblings because of the custody arrangement?,18374,No A-holes here,5395,d1r1vr,1568065252.0,"Edit/Update:

The moderators have been kind enough to let me update my post.

I know many, many people have asked about the skillset I mentioned. I just can't be specific because it'll make my younger kids' company identifiable with a quick search. I will say it's nothing mysterious and is a combination of woodworking, metalworking and some masonry sometimes. It's just a niche product and not many people do it. The tools and techniques are unorthodox.

I spent a lot of time reflecting yesterday after reading everyone's comments.

I have talked to my younger kids and I explained to them that even if they aren't happy with how their brother approached it, it's clear he feels left out from our family and it's all our responsibilities to help fix this.

They agreed to extend the offer of apprenticeship again to their brother where he works and learns as a salaried employee. But they've made it clear that no ownership can be transferred after he's put in at least three years of work like they have. I actually think this is generous because they are paying a salary that they don't need to.

However, I'm not sure if my oldest will go for this. He is feeling some sort of way about working for his brothers, not with them.

I reached out to a teacher in Alaska who I know casually. He might do me a favor and take on an apprentice. 

I need to scrounge up some money and see if I can send my son there. But again, it's Alaska and I'm not sure if my son will be receptive.

I don't know what else I can offer at this point. My wife is disgusted that we've become that family that is fighting about money. She wants to force the twins to give a stake in the company to their brother but I really think it's a bad idea. They need to fix their conflict first or it'll just be a disaster. I don't believe we should be telling our younger kids on how to run their company.

I'll be meeting my son this Friday for dinner. I hope he'll be ok with at least one of the options.

I also need to talk to my parents to stop creating more issues. They've always enjoyed chaos and like pitting people against each other. It's not helping.

Thanks everyone.


This is the original story:

This has quite literally fractured my family.

I have an older son from my first marriage who's now 24. I have two younger kids from my current marriage who are 21 year old twins.

My divorce occurred right after my son was born. 

Over the years, my visitation has been primarily summers and holidays since my ex-wife moved to a different state.

I have a particular skillset I'm was very good at. And all three of my kids have expressed interest in it. Unfortunately, I have only been able to meaningfuly teach it to my younger kids.

This was because to make my visitation with my older son more memorable, I would do camping/vacations etc. I didn't have time to teach him properly.

Also, anything I did try to teach him was forgotten and not practised because he lived in an apartment with his mother.

The major issue now is that my younger kids have started a company after highschool using this skill. I provided the initial funds and as such have a 33% stake in it. This company has really soared this past year and it's making a lot of money.

My older son graduated from college and is doing a job he hates and is not exactly making a lot of money. Especially compared to his siblings.

Part of this is my fault because he did ask to take a few years off after highschool and maybe have me teach him what I knew but my wife was battling cancer at the time and I told him I couldn't.

And now, I'm not well enough to teach anymore.

He is now telling me to include him in this company as a equal partner. That he'll do the finances.

This was not received well by his siblings who say they do basically 95% of the work. And that he didn't struggle in the earlier years to get it running.

I'm really at a loss here. I thought of just giving my share of the company to my oldest son but it does seem unfair to his siblings who started this company in the first place.

My oldest has become very bitter about this and has involved my parents. They are taking his side and now my younger kids are resentful that their grandparents have been turned against them.

Our Sunday family lunches are no longer happening and I'm having to see my oldest for dinner on other days. And everytime I see him I'm getting accused of not treating him fairly. It kills me because I made so many compromises to have him in my life in a meaningful way.

He accused me on Saturday of pushing him out my new family and loving his siblings more. I haven't been able to sleep since.

AITA for using the 'hidden' women's bathroom stalls when there's a long line?,18361,Not the A-hole,2246,cxl0j7,1567219142.0,"Okay this is so stupid and I really feel like I'm NTA but my friend is adamant that I am so I'm seeking Reddit's opinion via a throwaway account. 

My girl friends and I were recently at Canada's Wonderland and having been there dozens of times since I was a kid (am now in my 20s), I know that the women's bathroom at the front of the park has ""additional stalls"" at the back of the bathroom. 

So basically there's about 10-15 stalls at first sight and then at the far back, there's a sign that says ""additional stalls ->"" and there's 4 stalls that are never, ever being used because they're off in their own corner room. 

Well, for the last few times I've been to the park, there's always a long line (like 15 women sometimes) and I always go straight to the back room to check if anybody is there. There never is and I use the bathroom stalls there. On my way out I'll always tell other women""hey there's stalls back there"" to which they say thank you.

My friend now thinks I'm selfish and rude for doing this. She thinks that I should always go to the front of the line, tell the women about the bathrooms in the back, and then join the line at the end. 

I don't see it this way because the sign is so clear and it's not my fault they're not seeing these additional stalls. Not only that but walking to the front of the line, saying that, and then going to the back of the line is awkward as hell. 

My friend hasn't let it go and is now saying she ""sees a different side"" of me. This is something I truly don't think is that big of a deal and my friend is making me feel terrible, I'm starting to question if she's right?

Please tell me if I'm wrong, seriously, I don't get it. 

TL;DR: Apparently I'm an asshole for utilizing bathroom stalls that nobody ever uses because they don't know they're there.

EDIT: This is epic.. I really never thought or could have imagined a post like this could get so much attention. Thank you to everyone that replied. I'm now taking a break from my friend and reassessing how she treats me and makes me question little actions that aren't worthy of explosive attitude from her.

And to all women, I'm sorry our bathrooms suck. I'll be even more helpful letting others know about those stalls in the future.. having to pee really bad and waiting is the worst. Tiny bladder club!!",False,1567253401.0,2019-08-30 19:39:02
AITA for letting my kids reject hugs and kisses from family?,18364,Not the A-hole,4198,dvp9un,1573665694.0,"My two year old son is at an age where everyone wants to touch him and pinch him. 

My wife and I agreed we wouldn’t force our kids to hug or kiss anyone because we want to teach appropriate physical boundaries and ownership of your body from an early age. 

Recently my grandmother visited and when she was leaving my sister directed my son to “give Grammy a kiss goodbye” and he said “don’t want to” and we said “that’s fine, wave goodbye then.” And he waved and said goodbye. 

She started to say “oh, no kiss for Grammy?” But I shut that down with “(son) has a lot of ways to express his feelings” and we left it at that. She seemed to understand. 

My sister took her to the airport but when she was over later she said I was an asshole for not having my son kiss his great grandmother goodbye knowing it meant something to her just because he “didn’t want to”. 

I tried to explain not wanting physical touching isn’t the same as not wanting to leave the park or whatever, but she said it’s not as big a deal to him to give her a quick kiss as it was for her to feel her great grandson didn’t treasure her visit. 

We’re about to host thanksgiving and there will be plenty of family expecting hugs and kisses and physical affection from our son, and in a couple years, from our daughter as well.

AITA For going off on a lady for calling the cops on me? WIB if I reported her?,18358,Not the A-hole,2006,c8pupp,1562198549.0,"I'm black. My husband is white. He has a sister, who has a 3-year-old daughter who LOVES me, and who I think isn't too bad herself. My niece is equal parts terror and lovely, but mostly with me lovely. We hang out a lot to give my SIL a break, and my husband doesn't really ""get kids"" so it's often 1x1. 

I was out with my niece at a kid's playplace/mall for kids, and she was more terror than lovely. She was defiant, and I'm all about consequences after two warnings. She kept running from me laughing her butt off, so I told her it was time to go. Normally she'll go quietly but this time, filled with vim, vigor and grape juice, she pitched a GIGANTIC fit so I had to carry her. She wasn't screaming in a ""WHO IS THIS HELP ME"" way but in a clearly understandable ""NO, I WANT TO STAY AND PLAY. AUNTIE(ME), NO"" way. But also she's 3, so maybe if you're not used to her it's not clear. 

As we're leaving, a lady stops us asking if everything's okay. I smiled at her, and told her yes, that we just had to get home for a nap. She then got in my face like ""Do you KNOW this child."" I'm wrangling a screaming toddler, so I just said yes and tried to step around her. She then said, ""you're not leaving until you prove you know that child."" I told her, it's fine, we're related (my niece now was calm and holding me), she's just acting b-r-a-t-t-y and she said like, ""No mother would EVER say that about her kid"". Yeah, maybe. But she can't spell so. She then demanded I give her my niece, or call someone to confirm my identity. 

I was pissed. I told her I don't have to prove anything to her and I'm leaving with my kid. She then literally RAN  to security, screaming that a kid's being kidnapped. Cops called. Security guy asks what's up. I was polite to him but I told the lady off. I said it's way too damn *present day* to be act like  mixed race children, or blended family don't exist, and to IMMEDIATELY jump to kidnapping was insane. The cops showed, and they asked my niece who I am ""AUNTIE (ME)!"" and I showed them some pictures of us together in clearly different settings, they apologized, reprimanded her. It's done. 

She  works somewhere in the complex, but not where we were. I want to report it. She'd been watching us and saw my niece and I hanging for at LEAST 30 minutes familiarly. So while I could have showed her the pictures, I didn't feel like I needed to. It's not her job and in fact the person whose job it was apologized to me as we left. Now, I have had this happen before, and someone is a little sketched. I'm polite, it becomes obvious that she knows me, and they drop it. I just had flashforwards to a time when my niece might pull the ""THIS ISN'T MY MOM"" card. And then I really WOULD need the cops to be called because I'd kill her.

AITA for giving my sister up for adoption?,18343,Not the A-hole,2113,g87grq,1587901408.0,"I was adopted when I was 5 years old by a couple who were 28 and 30 at the time. They had no other children. This past year, two things happened. My adoptive father was diagnosed with cancer, and my adoptive mother got pregnant for the first time in decades. My adoptive mother always thought she was infertile, but apparently her ""miracle"" had arrived. She carried on with her pregnancy despite his cancer and her age. She died in childbirth, and my adoptive father followed her two months later. 

Which left me with an infant baby sister and two dead parents. My family is telling me that this is my duty, that I'm not a child or incapable, and of course they're not offering to take her in at all. They've all vehemently refused. Everyone is furious that I ""used"" my adoptive parents' resources, and now that it's time to reciprocate I'm ""taking the easy way out"". They say I'm the right age to have a child anyway, and that it's just like if I had sex and gave birth to her. They've even brought up my fertility reducing medical conditions, and say this is my chance.

This isn't my child. I'm not ready to be a parent. I have graduated college, yes, but I still had dreams. I'm not in a financial, emotional, or mental place to raise a child, even if I kept every penny of the meager inheritance. I'm still single, and I want to be able to date and maybe even marry and have my own family one day. I'll never be able to do anything with this child anchoring me down. 

I consulted with lawyers, and they say I have the right to give this child up for adoption. I'm using an adoption agency. It's an unusual adoption because I'm not attached or related to the child except legally, and I'm also splitting the inheritance 50/50 with my sister and giving it to the adoptive parents for her benefit, so they're gaining money by adopting this child. I picked a couple that my adoptive parents would have approved of, a mid 30s straight religious couple, as opposed to a 25 year old bisexual atheist (me). We've planned for an open adoption with a much more appropriate aunt role for me, and I think it will work out because I obviously don't feel or have a motherly bond.

My family is furious and I'm getting 24/7 calls that I'm selfish, that they'll force me to keep her, and all sorts of empty threats. Am I in the wrong here?

She gets company credit for food and drinks as she works for like a week at a time. She cooks all her own food and uses that money to buy a coffee each morning. She always goes to the same coffee shop. 

Me and my gf are very comfortable and she's bi so sometimes we will both say how hot a girl is or whatever. She always says the guy who serves her coffee is ""beautiful"", she confirmed that she wasn't attracted to him but that he was stunning and a very pretty man. That was fine. 

Anyway, so she goes in every day and always has stories to tell about the guy behind the counter. I trust her ENTIRELY, I know she doesn't really want him and wouldn't do anything. 

Anyway, I went in the other day and straight away knew who she meant as this gorgeous long haired dude took my order. I ordered her favourite drink as she was at home and I shit you not he said ""oh is that for Emma?"" And when I looked shocked he went ""I just know that's her usual, no one else really orders it"". I said yes, it is but by the way pal, she has a boyfriend and it's me. The guy kinda laughed and i said that I appreciate he's doing his job but to lay off her as in my eyes, I think he was flirting. He laughed again and said sure thing. 


I didn't tell my gf who went to get coffee a few days later and came home raging, saying how dare I embarrass her like that. This pissed me off cause why doesn't she want him to know?! She said she already mentioned me and that the guy is gay and she knows his boyfriend. 
Fair, innocent mistake on my behalf but the gf never told me this beautiful man was gay.

AITA for using poop bags for my daughter's birthday party?,18302,Asshole,7608,djxfrw,1571478914.0,"My daughter just turned 6. We had a birthday party for her on Saturday. That morning was pretty hectic. I was outside setting up and suddenly my wife comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake and I didn't notice.

All that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as ""Sarah"" and it's ""Sara"" and I said, ""who cares, just scrape off the H"" but she insisted on returning it. So I said ""fine whatever."" And then as she's leaving she says since I screwed up already I should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. 

And I go into the kitchen and I ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" She says ""the gift bags."" I found all the candy and toys and what I thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. So I make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.

My wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt I made at helping. So a little while after that, the guests arrive. The day went pretty well until the end. My daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. My wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says ""dont worry, dad made them"" and she looked so relieved until I got the box. She looked inside an was horrified

""What the fuck is this?"" she whispers. And she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. I follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. She's SO embarrassed. Why? She wont say. I'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. I then I just take over ""goodbye"" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.

Well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me ""those are dog poop bags"" and basically I'm stupid and I've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.

well, reddit, they dont look like ""dog poop"" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? I tell her ""It's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags"" and damn it she freaked. She says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.

So yeah I've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. I told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said I was a huge asshole and she's mad that I dont think it's a big deal. and I still dont. Actually, I think I'm the one that should be mad at HER for keeping this going for almost a week.

The place is rather far from my place, and since I don't drive, I would spend about an hour and half or so on bus to and fro just to buy them once in a while.


My younger(13F) sister loves them too, and she is always too lazy and stingy to buy for herself that she would steal from me. When she does steal, she would take the whole box of 6 and finish them before I realized they are missing. Whenever I confront her, she would laugh and say that I don't need all that since I am so fat. Yes, I do have a decent amount of chubs, but that's my business, not her's.


After quite a while of failing to hide the pretzels, shouting match between me and my sister, complaining to mum who doesn't give a damn and agree that I don't need extra fats, I have started using another way, ""Peanut Repellent"" I call it.


You see, my sister is mildly allergic to peanuts. She had accidentaly ingested them a couple of times in the past, she looked nasty for a while but nothing serious happened otherwise. Still, it was enough for her to make an effort to avoid eating peanuts.


I bought some breadcrumbs and would now sprinkle them on top of my pretzels in front of my sister whenever I buy them, announcing to her that they are peanut crumbs, so that she would stop stealing them anymore. She did stop.

AITA for refusing to let my sister play with our Switch after she failed to make payments on it?,18258,Not the A-hole,1763,g2c1wp,1587059682.0,"Basically my sister (14F) and I (20F) wanted a Nintendo Switch, but it costs a lot of money to get one so we decided to split the cost. Overall the switch + games + accessories cost about $420 (ayyy) and as I have a job and I’m older, I agreed to paying for most of it ($300).

We gave ourselves about 3 months to save up money, but by the end of it, my sister didn’t have enough for her $120 share (she was always spending money and hanging out with her friends.)

But I still wanted a Switch so I said I would cover her as long as she paid me back via artwork and drawings. She’s a great artist and she does do commissions, so we agreed that I would pay for her and in exchange, she would create 3-4 drawings for me.

So we bought the switch back in January and we both use it. Anyhow, I asked her to draw me a portrait of my friend for her birthday, nothing too strenuous, asked her 3 weeks in advance and gave her all the info she needed. She never delivered and i was angry, but I just bought my friend another present last minute so I wasn’t too upset.

Anyhow fast forward to February and she did the same thing. Then more recently, I asked if she could draw a character I liked from a TV show and she just straight up told me that she didn’t want to, that she never wanted to, that she didn’t know why I kept asking her to draw shit and that I was not entitled to her drawings.

I reminded her that her drawing for me was literally apart of the deal we had on the Nintendo switch but she said it’s been months since we got it so we should just drop it.

So I did just that and now I’m refusing to let her play the switch, of course she’s angry but I said it was technically my Switch now since I paid for it 100%. I brought it up to my mom and she said I need to be the bigger person here (figuratively and literally) and share it with my sister. AITA in this situation?

Anyhow, she actually came knocking on my door after lunch and apologized to me. She said her actions were unnecessary and she was mortified about how immature she acted. I kind of lectured her on financial responsibility and she took it very well actually! We started a change jar so she could save up, even if only a little bit at a time. We negotiated and I said the 3-4 drawing offer still stands, but I won't let her play with it until she creates at least one, and that I want the other three drawings done by the end of this year. So now she's drawing Haley from Stardew Valley. Some people are going to say I'm too lenient, but in the long run it's probably better off like this.",False,1587088422.0,2020-04-16 10:54:42

They live on the other side of the country, so it would typically mean a phonecall and maybe a birthday card. Well, I guess my husband forgot about it and didn't call her or send her a card.

I found this out because she called and was disappointed that she didn't hear anything from us. I told her that my husband probably should have put her birthday in his calendar and set a reminder, and that he never does.

She asked me why I didn't keep track of this stuff for him, because ""he's a guy, they don't care about that stuff."" She mentioned he'd skipped his sister's birthday and niece's and nephew's birthdays too, and that I should start trying to remind him. And then she said ""And don't forget Mother's Day, either.""

I said that she would have to talk to him about this, and it didn't sit well with her. She got annoyed and told me that like it or not, it's kind of ""my job"" to keep track of this stuff, because again, guys don't care. I said ""Well, if he doesn't care, he doesn't care. I'm not his mom.""

She ended up talking to him about it, and he got pretty annoyed with me for not reminding him about this stuff and that he just doesn't remember this kind of stuff. He said that we're a team and that he's obviously not good at this, so I should step up.

I asked him what the release date for a video game he'd been talking about was. He said the exact date. I just looked at him for a minute, and he got pretty defensive and said ""That's totally different.""

Then I said we would make a calendar together that we both had on our phones so we would get reminders for important dates. He agreed. So I started the calendar, entered in my dates, and it has been sitting there, unused for the past two months. What happened? He missed another birthday, and the whole thing started again.

But now it's become this big war between his family and me for me not ""keeping up"" on birthdays because it's supposed to be my job. He got really mad at me for not filling in the calendar for him because I should know all the dates anyway. I don't. AITA?

**Edit:** So I don't have to keep saying this over and over, I had no idea when his mom's birthday was. She's not *my* mom, and I have never celebrated her birthday before, so I am not sure why I would ever know that. Same with the others in his family.

I have two brothers and our father hasn’t been in the picture since I was 15 so and my BFs father left him and his mom when he was really young. 

My brothers are 24 and 21. The 24 year old has a GF who I think is 23. My brothers and the GF came to spend the weekend with us. 

We have lake front property and a little probate beach area. We have signs up that states it is private  property to deter trespassers and cameras that monitor the beach 

This afternoon, we had been taking a break after going on jet ski ride, my youngest brother was helping me cook lunch and my other brother and his GF had decided to go down to the beach. They came back up and told me that there were people on our beach. They had asked them to leave, but they didn’t. 

My BF went down to investigate and apparently there was a whole boat load containing five adults and four kids. He again asked them to leave and told them it was private property. They refused. He called the police and ate lunch as we waited for the police to come. 

Over an hour has gone by and the police hasn’t showed up. He had been planning to go down to beach after lunch so we decided to go down and try and annoy the family into leaving. We played music with explicit lyrics (nothing too bad but still) brought down alcoholic drinks and played drinking games. We purposely and out of character acted rowdy not putting a filter on what we said, my boyfriend and I, who are not ones for PDA, kept holding hands, making out and stuff because there was a good chance this group of people was homophobic (we live in the south). 

After awhile, the group god fed up and left, before the group left one of the women yelled at us “shame on you people for ruining what was supposed to be a nice Father’s Day for my husband and brother. We just wanted a good day on the lake and didn’t need to witness frat boys gone wild.” 

I shrugged and said, “I mean this is MY property my family and I can do whatever the fuck we want on it. Next time do as your told and stay the fuck away.” 

The adults in the group look disgusted, one of them men looked like was about to yell at us for what we said but instead they just drove off.

I don't get paid supremely well, below minimum wage ($60/6hr when minimum would be $84/6hr) but it's still been agreeable because it's easy money and I can study while I'm there. My friend is also not particularly well off (or wasn't as you'll soon read) so I was throwing them a bone by being lenient on the wage. The husband is against babysitting and daycares (he was a victim of abuse this way) but he agreed because we're all friends and have been for a long time.

My friend won $740,000 in the lottery two months ago and everything is more or less settled in. They bought two new 2019 cars ($60,000+ vehicles), travelled a bit, etc. But they still paid me the same amount, which stung because I'm covering for them while they went to Cuba and Mexico.

They can afford to pay me more, so I told them this. I want minimum wage, and they declined saying it's too expensive. So I decided to no longer babysit for them. This means they'll have no babysitter because my friend's husband doesn't care for them.

I know I'm not the asshole for quitting over a wage but it's not entirely that. I'm half doing this vindictively because I know they're in a peculiar position where I'm their only option. But all I want is minimum wage, I'm not going to gouge them over this fact. Part of it might be jealousy but if they can afford $120,000+ in cars in the span of two months, they can afford an extra $24 per shift of my babysitting.

AITA for not making my daughter share her lottery winnings with her stepsister?,18244,Not the A-hole,1707,egrws9,1577575330.0,"



Even though she’s under 18 for holidays I always get my daughter a couple of scratchers that I will cash for her. My dad used to do the same for me and it was fun even if I didn’t win. The only rules I made about them are anything over a hundred dollars goes into a savings account for when she’s older.

I decided to give my stepdaughter some lottery tickets too. I had asked my wife about it beforehand and she was going to have the same rules with the money except she would be the one to hold onto anything over a hundred for her daughter since we keep our finances mostly separate.

My stepdaughter scratched hers and won $10. My daughter scratched hers and won $300. So I cashed them in and gave my daughter $100 and my stepdaughter the $10. 

My stepdaughter was disappointed and my wife thinks I should have split up the money evenly so each of the girls got at least $55 to spend and $100 to save since the ticket and money were technically mine legally.

I don’t think splitting up my daughters money would have been fair to her. I certainly wouldn’t have made my stepdaughter to give mine any of her winnings if she won more.

Edit. Messed up on math. After taking out the $200 and splitting it up they  would get $55 spend.

Edit 2. A lot of people seem to have missed the part where I explained the rule I had about them, so I’ll repeat it. I am not keeping any of the money for myself. The $200 I didn’t give my daughter went into her savings account that she can use when she’s older.

Edit 3. They’re $1 scratchers. The grand prize is under $1000. So no need to worry about one of them winning thousands or millions.

In the summer of 2016, I was driving pretty late at night. There wasn’t anybody around so I was enjoying the peace and quiet. Then, out of nowhere, this speeding car hit me and I remember hearing a loud screech and seeing black. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital and I’m told I was in a horrific car crash. Basically, another driver had been drunk driving and was speeding and slammed straight into the driver side of the car. My lower body was crushed and I had broken all the major bones in my lower right leg beyond repair and that my leg had been immediately amputated from the knee whilst I was unconscious. I also had breaks in other parts of me, open bleeding wound and even some burn wounds as part of the car had been leaking and caught fire. All in all, I was pretty lucky to be alive as I should have died.

Anyway, I had a long recovery. I was in hospital for months and also had to learn to walk again with a fake leg. When I eventually did heal, I was left with some noticeable burn scars, normal scars due to the crash and quite glaringly a missing leg. The crash had a profound effect on me as I was only 20 and it destroyed my relationship with my then girlfriend and my mental health. It took me a long time to feel comfortable being an amputee and I decided to get into the dating game. My friends helped me and I have currently been talking to someone for the past few weeks and we’ve been able to meet a couple of times. She knows I’m missing a leg but I never explained why as I didn’t really know her and it was an insanely personal thing to open up about. 

I finally told her what happened to me last night and explained that it’s not something that’s easy for me to talk about and how I’m pretty scarred both physically and mentally from it. I kinda thought she’d get it but she got really angry with me. She said that I’m an AH as I clearly don’t trust her enough to open up about my past to her, especially something as huge as the crash as it’s pretty visible I only have one leg. I tried to reason with her and say that it’s only been a few weeks but I just made things worse.

I do really like her and I think maybe I could have said something earlier so I can see why she felt a little hurt but I also believe that sometimes huge things take time to come out so idk. AITA?

Update: thought it was clear enough but the guy who hit me was driving drunk not me. I was sober.

Update 2: a lot of people have said this is a red flag so tbh I’m considering asking to meet her again and explain that her behaviour was now I realise not okay and that I’m considering things between us. If it’s not meant to be, it’s not meant to be.

Update 3; I read a lot of comments basically saying I deserved better and fuck it, after a few hours of thinking ,you’re right. I asked to meet her again and I plan on telling her to her face I don’t see us going anywhere.",False,1592170552.0,2020-06-14 10:51:46
AITA for legally changing my name and refusing to speak to my mother,18222,Not the A-hole,612,ft5rx2,1585794831.0,"Growing up, my mother had a horrible habit of trying to one-up my Aunt Terra. She did everything from dying her hair like my aunt, making our living room a replica of her's, and getting better versions of her pets. My Mom was the ""pretty sister"" growing up, married ""better"" and had ""better kids.""

This caused huge resentment for my siblings and I. Everything we did was thrown into our cousin's faces. This led to us not speaking to my mother that often and refusing to go to see our Aunt Terra. I was close with my cousins \[we went to the same school\] but I hated when my mom was around.

What made it even more awkward was the fact my mom stole my aunt terra's names.

My oldest brother is Martin and a year younger than cousin Martina. I am named for my cousin Rebecca \[I'm Becca\] and we are six months apart.

I started going by Eve \[short for my middle name Evelyn\] when I was 13. My Mom refused to call me anything but Becca. But my whole family was more than happy to call me whatever I wanted. My brother went by his middle name as well.

I turned 18 and my dad paid for the legal name change. I am now Evelyn Surname.

My mom threw a fit and threatened to never speak to me again. I took her up on that offer and stopped contact. My dad has since divorced her and at 25 I have not spoken to her in *years.* She has reached out to me and said she was in therapy, had started medication for bipolar, and she wants me in her life.

I was almost tempted but she ended the message with ""I miss my Becca.""

I told her she had the wrong person, there was no Becca here. I told her when she wanted to speak to Eve I would be here. She has not reached out since.

AITA for getting mad at my mom for continuously forgetting about my gf's allergy?,18214,Not the A-hole,2316,eeosdx,1577156118.0,"Hi everyone.

My girlfriend and I have been together nearly 2 years now and have spent a bunch of get togethers with my family in that time. From the beginning, I told my parents that my girlfriend has a serious pork allergy. Whenever a family occasion comes up that involves them cooking, I always remind them about the allergy because they always seem to forget (and my family seems to eat a lot of pork, go figure). Last year at Christmas, my mom cooked the turkey with bacon layered on the top of it despite knowing about my girlfriend's allergy, and my girlfriend couldn't eat it.

So, since the holidays are coming up I reminded my mom a few weeks ago about the allergy. Today at lunch I was talking to my mom and brought up Christmas Day. She then says, ""I'm cooking the turkey with bacon on top"". I just looked at her and said ""If you do that, (insert girlfriend's name) won't be able to eat it like last year"". Then she got all upset and says ""Fine, I just won't cook it with bacon like I had planned then"" and I said, ""You don't have to do a whole separate plan"" and she got pissed off and said ""Good  I won't."" She then asked if my girlfriend can eat ham and I just looked at her incredulously and reminded her that no, she can't, because ham is also pork. She just huffed at that and walked away from the table and didn't sit down again.

I feel hurt because I feel like there's an inconsiderate aspect to this by both of my parents not keeping in mind my girlfriend's allergy and me having to continually remind them. I'm mad because if I hadn't said anything today, the turkey would have again been cooked with bacon on it and my girlfriend wouldn't have been able to eat it, which I personally would find upsetting if I were in her shoes and it happened for a second year in a row.

AITA for calling my angry neighbor out in front of her family?,18202,Not the A-hole,693,g4u6s8,1587423098.0,"I moved into an apartment on the ground floor of a house which is split up into three apartments. The house next door is owned by a couple with several kids.

The woman who lives there has a temper... A few times, when I've been hanging out with friends in the back yard, she's yelled at us over stuff. Playing music with cusses where her kids can hear, being too ""slutty"" with each other, which was awkward because we were not doing anything sexual... Other stuff that's too ugly to repeat here... Etc.

As far as I can tell she never does this in front of her husband or kids. Her husband isn't home often, it seems. 

Then, a while later, I was out getting my mail when four people walked by, the neighbor lady, her husband, and two older people who I think were either her parents or her husband's parents.

The husband asked me if I knew there was water leaking from the hose in the front yard of my house. He seemed friendly and like he was trying to be helpful.

I said I hadn't known, maybe the maintenance guy left it on.

But then I got a really weird feeling about how the woman that has said so much nasty stuff was standing with her family acting really chill in front of them.

I said ""Hey, excuse me, aren't you the lady who's called my friends and I sluts, (homophobic slur), and (c-words) ? I was hoping to talk to you at a calmer moment.

She said no right away.

I then, knowing full well that she was that lady, said ""Oh sorry, perhaps I'm confused. There's a lady who lives in that house, mid 40s, heavyset with chin length brown hair, smokes out back every night, who's said all those things and more, and I really don't appreciate it. Do you have a sister? A roommate?""

She cut me off and said maybe it's better I leave, and so I did. I heard fighting from that house that night and I think it was because of what I said, her husband and the older couple seemed shocked by some of it.

This means that while your in the rack looking in the mirror, over your shoulder on either side is other people facing away from you in their own rack.  Because it might help with context I’m 6’, 170lbs (so not some giant bodybuilder) and the girl in this story is average height and weight as well (not some fitness model but not substantially overweight either).  

While in between sets, I’m standing with my arms on the bar and generally feeling like shit after my first few heavy sets when I see a girl behind me in the mirror at the bottom of her squat and immediately notice that I can clearly see her ass through her pants. 

Like 90% of people in the gym I just want to be left alone, ignore everyone, and pretend the world doesn’t exist.  So I move on with life and do another set, but then she does her set and sure enough when she is at the bottom of her squat her yoga pants are stretched on her ass they go completely see through and I can pretty much see her butthole.  I don’t mean if I squint and stare, I mean plain as day, anyone on my side of the racks can see through her pants. 

No idea why I cared (am married and completely uninterested) but I go into helpful mode and pull my headphones out and turn around quietly enough that only the two of us can hear say this:

“Hey this is super creepy, but I’d feel creepier if I didn’t say something.  When you squat, your pants stretch and go completely see through on your ass.”

Again I thought I was being helpful and that she’d want to know, but wholly shit did she not see it that way. This girl practically screams “You fucking pervert! Stop staring at my ass!” 

Not needing to be told twice now that half the gym is staring at me, I go back to my workout and suffer the angry looks for another 20min and go home.

Edit 2: PLEASE STOP GIVING ME AWARDS THIS IS A THROWAWAY ACCOUNT. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON PEOPLE WHO MAKE DANK MEMES

The title sounds harsh, but hear me out.

My fiance and I are late 20's, have been together for 6 years(with a three month period we were broken up, but we don't really count that), set to marry in 2 years, Summer 2021.

I make pretty good money for my age. In fact, I make more money than any of my friends or family, and I would bet I'm in the ""1%"" of my community. I try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. I should also add when we started dating, I was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the ""gold digger"" argument just isn't there.

My fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. She was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  Since then, she hasn't worked. I really didn't mind at all. I make enough for us both to have some major cushion. 

I am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead I just would venmo her some cash weekly. It was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.

She has been complaining more and more about how she's ""broke"", doesn't have enough to survive etc. I know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  She has been hinting at wanting more money from me.

I shudder to say ""allowance"", but that's what it seems to be.

I told her I would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so I could see exactly what she was spending it on. I could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but I hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.

She blew up. Telling me I wasn't trusting her and how I was the one against joint bank accounts so I should understand her privacy. Yeah, HUGE red flags all over the place.

I talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying I was not respecting her privacy when I'm the one that demands it also.

"AITA for calling the police on the parents that left me to babysit their toddlers without my consent, and telling them I will no longer babysit their kids anymore?",18160,Not the A-hole,989,ex7na8,1580599631.0,"I'm VERY late on this, sorry.

I'm an 18 year old guy with a lot of experience when it comes to handling kids. I've babysat my baby brother multiple times when I was 14-15, and even some of my cousins aged around 3-8 (where I live it's not illegal to do, so don't worry). I do this when I'm free on the weeked.

My town's pretty small and the people there are very busy sometimes. Combine that with the fact that there aren't many babysitters and well, news spread (via my mum who wanted me to do this) that I'm a good option.

I voluntarily do my services for cheap, (I'll use the currency dollars to put it into perspective for most of you) approximately $2-3/hour, sometimes even for free. The parents/carers are always so surprised and amazed when they arrive back to see everything in perfect condition, and even more so when I tell them the price. They often offer more but I reject, because I just enjoy working with kids.

This one family took advantage of this though. I live alone with a few roommates, so this family I previously served multiple times called me and felt that they owed me a special Thanksgiving dinner because it was the least that they could do.

I don't celebrate Thanksgiving, but I didn't want to be rude to their kind offer and decided that I would go. I drove there and we were having a good time eating and talking. My parents called to check on me so I excused myself to leave the room and go on a quick call with them and left. They must seen this as an opportunity of some sort, because the next thing you know they left quickly and left a note on the table saying ""Sorry! We'll be right back and pay you in full."", and left me with a 4 year old boy and 3 year old girl.

It was late and I had plans to enjoy my Thanksgiving holiday and they ruined it. I obviously wasn't happy so I tried calling them 3 times but they didn't pick up. I dialled the non-emergency police number and when the officer showed up, I told him everything.

The parents turned up and the officer demanded their side of the story. They told him they had to attend an emergency community meeting. They were lucky not to get fined, but the officer gave them a strong reprimanding and left. They were confused and ticked off at me. I said ""you should have let me know and you practically left your kids with me without my consent. That's illegal""

I then told them ""don't expect me to babysit your kids here on out"". They've tried to call me numerous times that they need me and they apologise, but I wasn't having any of it. I told my parents and they thought I was being a little too harsh.

**EDIT**: A LOT of you guys are confused at my contradictive phrasing. **I don't celebrate Thanksgiving**, but you can still celebrate the holiday with your own plans instead without actually celebrating the event. I know some non-Christian friends who decided to go on a vacation to France during the Christmas holidays, that doesn't necessarily mean that they ""celebrate Christmas"". It's just taking a break from all the stuff you usually do and having fun. If I'm making sense.

**EDIT 2:** You guys are right. I ought to charge more. It seems like I undervalue my work and I don't. But with charge rates like that, it's very easy to be taken advantage of. Thank you for all of your insights on this.",False,1580587565.0,2020-02-01 15:27:11
AITA for thinking the school or the other Parent show pay for new epipens?,18156,Not the A-hole,1323,f8vfbj,1582596933.0,"On Friday a student at my daughters school had a severe allergic reaction. The kids parent never brought in a new epipen after an old one expired and the school didn’t have any of their own so they used my daughters pens. Both of them. Now I’m not upset they used them. It may have saved the kids life. I’m glad the kid is okay. 
Today when I went to drop off new ones for the school and I asked the school for contact information of the parent so I can get reimbursed for the new pens. They told me they couldn’t give me that information and refused to even contact the parent for me. So I produce the receipt and said OK you can reimburse me for it as my Insurance would only pay once a year for them, I do it every January and I had to get these out of pocket. The woman acted like I had aborted a baby in front of her. She refused saying that the school isn’t liable for the use of the EpiPens. 
I make okay money but these damn things are not cheap, 650$, and that’s still a lot of money for us. I’m glad that it was used to save a kids life but I really do feel as if I should be reimbursed. But I was made to feel like a worthless asshole. 
I spoke to the principal of the school and... well I was a little more short that I should have been after the secretary was such a bitch and he’s going to talk to the school board. Currently they’ve never had this happen before and they don’t know how to proceed. It cost me 650$ to replace the set. 

So AITA for wanting someone to repay me for a life saving drug that was used on another child?

Edit: Thanks. I really do feel better. The office staff and principal seemed like I was the worse person in the world. I normally don’t care to much what people think but those stares. They really got to me.

Edit 2: So I just got off the phone with the school’s superintendent. She apologized. It turns out that the school did in fact have epipens on campus but the person in question didn’t know the location of the emergency box, another issue, and used my child’s pens. She said that they would be doing mandatory retraining for all staff and personnel. They would also be reimbursing me the cost. It would take about a week. She also apologize for the rudeness of the staff at the school this morning and that they didn’t follow protocol last week on Friday about informing me that my daughter didn’t have an epipen any longer. 
In short I wasn’t being an asshole after all and the office staff was for whatever reason. Maybe they were scared that me asking questions would lead to something. I don’t know. I just want to thank all of you. Especially those that gave me information on the generic forms of this drug. I’m going to talk to my daughters doctor about it as in the past I was told there wasn’t a generic. This will really help us save because the damn things are so costly and I make just enough that I don’t qualify for any of the programs to help lower the cost.

AITA for laughing at a kid in my nephews play,18155,,2138,e94y2b,1576085531.0,"Ok so i have a feeling i know the answer to this one already - but i just want to see from a bigger POV.

My nephew is 8 - he was staring in his first Christmas play, my sister invited me to it since i was coming to see her that day anyway. We all get in, all the kids in the school are sitting down in front of the stage and all the parents/family are standing at the back. My nephew was playing as a reindeer. Everyone in his class has an equal role, about 2-3 lines worth of stuff to say.

My nephew was brilliant, nailed his lines, he really looked like he enjoyed himself, so then we just had to stand and wait for all the other kids to have their parts and then we get to congratulate the kids after.

This one girl, same age as my nephew was playing Mrs Claus - she was visibly nervous and shakey, it came off more cute than awkward - as she was saying her lines, she got a bit flustered and forgot a part - she got a little stuck on it and there was silence for about 4 seconds. Then all of a sudden, the girl just said ""Oh fuck! i forgot!"" - There were a few gasps among the parents - all the kids were sniggering, but i just lost it, i dont know what it is about young kids swearing but i found it hilarious. I was snort laughing and many people turned around to look at me, i tried to take myself out of the hall and try to compose myself, but i got to the door and i just ended up falling over and laughing harder, i was wheezing, my stomach hurt and i just couldn't contain myself.  I'm a 30 year old man and this was my defeat.

The doors are just glass doors so i crawled out to the hallway just outside of the main stage hall but you can clearly still seem me through the door and i'm assuming you could still hear me. I took myself to the toilet - splashed some water on my face and returned to the hall. Some parents and kids kept looking at me and giggling, understandably so.

After the play finished, i congratulated my nephew, said how good he did, and then i saw the little girl who swore and her mum, i went over to apologise for laughing - the daughter seemed absolutely fine, she was just happy that she was on stage but the mum was very annoyed with me - i said sorry to her and the mum said something along the lines of ""Remember where you are, it's very immature to laugh at children."" and took her daughter away.

My sister said not to worry about it, the mum is a bit of a fun sponge anyway, but i feel a bit bad about what happened.

EDIT for clarification and FAQ:-

* I only fell on the floor laughing when i got to the door, only a few parents at the back would have seen that part.
* This wasn't my son, it was my nephew, it says that in the title.
* The initial snort-laugh when the girl first said it was the only part where people were staring at me and giggling.
* I cannot stress enough that i didn't do this for attention and to steal the light, im not that type - i've had a rough few months with some deaths and i think that may have factored into why i laughed so hard at this.
* I'm a gay 30 year old with no kids so this one really took me by surprise (evidently)",False,1576245975.0,2019-12-11 09:32:11
AITA for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?,18147,Not the A-hole,2954,cwg4ez,1566996933.0,"tl;dr at bottom

Okay so I’m almost 19.

When my paternal uncle was around 22, he got his girlfriend pregnant, but they had an abortion. They got married later on, converted to Christianity and became pro-life advocates, and had two daughters, who are currently 26 and 23. 

I know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. He didn’t say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. I thought it’s weird they never told their daughters, given that they’re all such protestors against abortion.

But anyways dad also has a sister, who’s daughter I’m really close with. She’s Christian like the rest of us, but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last May. Then her boyfriend left her over it. I absolutely adore her baby, and I try to help raise him given that he doesn’t have a father.

I’m usually on good terms with my aforementioned uncle’s daughters, and I was messaging them three way last night. I was sending a bunch of cheery pictures and messages of the baby, and eventually they asked why I would celebrate him so much given that he was created in sin.

I told them our cousin has prayed for forgiveness and that everyone makes mistakes. But they overrode me, saying that she’s easy and shouldn’t have spread her legs blah blah blah. It went on for a few more messages.

I got really frustrated at one point and in a fit of rage said 

“Yeah I hate to break it to you ladies but your parents got pregnant and had an abortion all outside of marriage way back when. Everyone makes mistakes and our cousin is trying to make the best of a bad situation, so lighten up.”

Three hours later and there was still no response; I knew I was in deep shit.

And I was! My parents yelled at me, grounded me, and took away my electronics last night, meaning I’m using my old old old phone right now. They were very tense with me today. I was very earnest. 

I always like posting online where no one can physically judge me, so thus I ask, AITA for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?

She had heard of me through a friend of hers (Kate) who is someone I babysit for regularly - so when Kate asked me to babysit for Jane and gave glowing recommendations of how lovely Jane was to me (I'm quite shy) and how good I was to Jane - I thought ""sure. I enjoy babysitting, love kids, etc - why not?"" My mother took me over to Jane's house, introduced herself, gave Jane her number and left once she saw that there were actually kids there, that Jane and her husband Peter were getting ready to leave, that it was legit basically. 

Jane and Peter left and I babysit the kids who were cool kids. I watch a movie, clean up the mess we had made in the kitchen (spaghetti with toddlers is a nightmare!) and chill on my phone. Nothing I do on my phone while I am at Jane's is anything near 'inappropriate'. I do have a lockable folder with some inappropriate things on there (aka anime and manga that are definitely NOT G rated) but don't touch that folder at all while I'm there. 

Jane comes home at 10pm, checks on the kids, checks out the house and as I'm waiting to be paid, she turns to me and says ""before I pay you - I need to look at your phone. I want to make sure that you didn't take photos of my house or my kids or look at anything rude"". I ask her whether she means she wants to look at my Iphone's camera roll and she shakes her head.

My mother replies that she will be also talking to Kate about her choice of 'good friends' and we leave. 

My reason for the post is that Jane made a post on our neighbourhood community page on facebook talking about bad babysitters who couldn't accept the parents 'rules' they had for babysitting and still demanded to be paid - and was offering to ""pm"" people more details. Someone else screenshotted their conversation where, although she didn't name me, she named the exact situation and Jane got over 100 comments talking about how that was her right as a parent/homeowner/what not to check that her children were not harmed while left with a babysitter and the fact that I refused means I ""obviously"" did something wrong.

AITA for posting a video of the mayor of my town driving like an idiot to YouTube?,18139,Not the A-hole,757,gz2a70,1591661655.0,"
I have a dashcam and sometimes I upload videos of dumb shit I see to YouTube. 

Anyway, I was driving home from work a few days ago and saw a really expensive Audi cut across three lanes in one move, and cut into the exit lane I was in, barely squeezing in between me and the start of the barrier. I slammed the brakes, and there wasn't any accident but it shook me up. It was the closest call I've ever had.

The driver pulled off into a gas station and I pulled over by the side of the road so I could turn my dashcam and get a clear video of the driver's face as he pumped gas, so I could confirm his identity. I had been wanting to make a report for reckless driving because the guy had almost caused a really bad accident.

I had never reported something before, but this was probably the scariest close call I'd ever had and I thought it would be a good idea to.

I reported it to the police non emergency line, and they said they'd get back to me but I didn't hear anything yet.  I also put the video on YouTube titled ""crazy Audi driver in HomeTownName"" 

Anyway, a few days later, someone commented on the video saying that was the mayor. I didn't believe it at first but then I looked up pictures of him, and was certian. It was definitely the same guy, he'd even been photographed by a local reporter near his Audi.

I edited the video title and description and said that it was the mayor of the town! And I guess because it's such a small town and the video got shared around, it's one of the earlier results if you look this guy up. It's apparently gotten shared in some Facebook groups like a local mother's group, and a community group, and the guy is getting a lot of shit for it. I didn't see the reposts myself, I'm not on Facebook.

But I got a call from one. of the mayor's employees asking me to take the video down. I said I'd like to talk to the guy, like I wanted to just have a chat with the person who nearly killled me, and then wouldn't even call me himself to apologise? And she got really defensive but also formal like ""I'm afraid that isn't possible at the moment"" 

Anyway, some of my coworkers think it was kinda shitty of me to follow the guy, film him, and put his name on the internet. And I guess I get that; but I also feel like as a public figure and a representative this guy should be held to a higher standard.

She will be my first child but it turns out she won't be his first child. He's been carrying on an affair that started several years ago during my residency in internal medicine and cardiology. His excuse was I was working long hours and not emotionally available so I ""drove"" him to it. I found out about the affair because the woman with their child came to our home 2 months ago demanding I release him from our financially abusive and loveless marriage. 

I guess you could say I ambushed him because I called him and told him he needed to come home. When he did and he saw her I knew based upon his reaction he had been cheating. So I kicked him and all his stuff out of the house. In my book, I granted his wish. He has asked for another shot that we go to marriage counseling but he has had years to come clean and didn't so I am unwilling to attempt reconciliation. 

He's been calling and leaving messages at home, my cellphone, as well as the hospital where I work asking if he could be with me when I go into labor. I've told him in no uncertain terms will he be allowed in or anywhere near my birthing room. I want people in there that I trust and he isn't it. He's been guilt-tripping me though saying he has a right to see his child be born. That his fuck up is separate from our daughter, and it is but I don't want the added stress of him being present.

His family and he all think I'm the AH and already alienating him from his child. My family and most friends support me, however, there are a few who think I'm being an AH here. Maybe I am because of the hurt he has caused me.

TL:DR found out STB ex-husband has been cheating for years and I've banned him from the birthing room.

Edit: for those worrying about alimony we have a prenup in place which by him cheating he is in full violation of. He is therefore not entitled to any alimony. 

He is on his own a mechanical engineer and though he doesn't make nearly as much as I do as a cardiologist he can more than afford to take care of himself financially without my help.

Edit: we do not live in the US for those wondering. I graduated secondary (or HS) at 16, completed uni (or college) at 20, finished medical school at 24, and completed my residency at 28. My country does not require doctors to enter fellowship programs. 

Edit: let me make this perfectly clear as it has continuously come up. I will NOT under any circumstances keep him from having a relationship with his daughter. I am completely agreeable to shared custody, and to him seeing her after she has been born.",False,1583183844.0,2020-03-02 15:08:18
AITA for starting a business in direct competition with my father's and making him lose clients?,18121,Not the A-hole,2851,dcdv02,1570068037.0,"So I have a father who left our family to start a new one with our neighbor when I was 13. I never fully forgave him even thought he tried (and still does) to make it up to me.

Growing up, he would pay me to work with him in his company. It's pretty advanced construction finishing stuff (like custom molding for many different uses).

I worked with him on and off through college and I've gotten very good at it.

He asked me to join his company full time as  an equal owner after I graduated. But my stepmom had a fit and basically forced my stepbrother into the mix as well.

I do not get along with my stepbrother and told my father that it's either him or me. He also did not have the right skills to work in a major capacity.

To no one's surprise, my father said I needed to compromise so everyone in the family can be happy.

I refused to compromise and went ahead and set up my own company. My father was upset but I guess he figured he couldn't stop me. We continued having weekly dinners.

For some reason, people are liking my company's work more. I have expanded my company more than my father ever has. I also targetted his major clients who have slowly come over to my company. I don't even do any of the labor myself anymore unless I want to.

Last week, my father broke down and said his business was struggling to survive. I admit I did feel bad so I offered him a full time job in my company and that I'd buy out his tools and workshop lease. But I told him my stepmother and stepbrother are not welcome  anywhere near my company.

This made my father pretty angry and we had a pretty big fight. He said I betrayed him. Then I basically told him he betrayed me by cheating on my mother. 

I do feel kind of guilty I ruined my father's company he worked hard to build. But at the same time he forced me into this position by getting his family involved.

"AITA for “double-reporting” an employee (to his boss, and then to corporate) and probably getting him fired?",18071,Not the A-hole,2097,cmh276,1565068329.0,"My husband and I have a 15 year old son, who is biracial; my husband is African American and I am white (this will be important later on in the story). My son just got his driver’s permit and has begun driving with me on a regular basis. The other day we were on the road, and he accidentally cut off a truck, making him have to break abruptly.

I scolded my son and gave a “sorry” wave to the driver. At the next red light which came about a minute later, the guy pulled up next to us. His car had a large company logo on it, indicating he was on the job. He rolled down the window and shouted the N-word at my son. My son’s face went pale, and he was quiet, depressed and clearly wounded deeply the rest of the drive home. The encounter **sickened** me.

I did some research on the company; at one point I even plugged them into Facebook. They have a very active Facebook page and seem like an organization that prides themselves on a good image and good customer service. I called the company and reported the man’s behavior, describing him very vividly. They informed me that they knew exactly who I was talking about, and that all their drivers drive with a dashcam, so his behavior is on camera. I had a good feeling about the encounter and that they were going to definitely take care of the situation.

Two months later, when I was browsing Facebook kind of boredly one day, the company’s name was recommended in my search, and just for the hell of it I clicked and looked at their page for the first time in two months. One of the very first photos/posts I saw from just a day ago showed a big group of their employees huddled together in their company yard, with some kind of tag about a project they just completed. To my horror, I saw the employee who shouted at my son in the group, grinning widely. Meaning they didn’t fire him.

The company is part of a nationwide chain, so I called their corporate headquarters, was connected to the highest person I could get to, and I reported the incident to them, and complained about how they didn’t fire him. The man I spoke to sounded **disgusted**, way, way more so than the previous person I’d reported him to, apologized profusely, and thanked me very much for telling him. Additionally, he made multiple statements about how racists and bigots have “no place” and “no future” in his company, giving me a strong feeling the offending employee’s career is now toast.

Was it right of me to “double-report” this guy? I’m sure he was given at least some consequence the first time around (if not fired) and wonder if some might argue that I was going too far or being vindictive by reporting him again.

AITA For Getting My Cousin's GF Banned From Family Dinners,18064,Not the A-hole,863,g8cq3t,1587928909.0,"My boyfriend [19M] has been dating me [19F] since we were 14. I am close with my uncles, aunts, cousins, and grandparents. We get together often to hangout, celebrate holidays, and eating out for birthdays. We eat out like every month together. My boyfriend almost always comes with me. My extended family and him love each other and consider each other family. 


At our dinners, either I pay, my parents pay, or me and my parents both pay partially, for whatever I order. My boyfriend pays for what he orders. Whenever the two of us go on dates we both pay for whatever we order most of the time. We both like this arrangement. We both work and have very close salaries.


My cousin's [32M] girlfriend [33F] has been coming to these dinners for the past two years. However the past year she's been rude and sexist (in my opinion) to my boyfriend. It started with her passively aggressively loudly talking about how guys who are good boyfriends always pay for the girl's order. She also would announce how she's ordering certain expensive items and drinks. She started telling my boyfriend at dinners that he should be paying for me. She got more and more rude about it, telling him he doesn't deserve me. She once went to confront him about it when he went to the bathroom.


I tried talking to my cousin about it but he just says he can't control her behavior. I try defending my boyfriend to her sometimes when she makes these comments but it doesn't stop. So I talked to some family about it and they agreed she was getting really rude. They told my cousin to get her to cut it out but she kept doing it. After she confronted him, my family decided my cousin's gf wasn't welcome to the dinners anymore until she apologizes. My cousin is now furious at me calling me a snitch and saying how unfair it is a ""dumb teen relationship"" is getting priority among our family over their ""adult relationship"". He has been cold to me since. I wasn't setting out to get her banned but this is what my family decided. I love my boyfriend and want him to feel comfortable.

AITA for working from my car in a parking lot because my wife is having my MIL stay with us,18061,Not the A-hole,2441,geiw7s,1588796165.0,"My wife gave birth to our son 8 weeks ago, and since then my MiL has moved in with us. I figured it would be for a week or two while she got settled, but it’s been 2 months. And that was fine when I could go to work, but now I can’t. And I swear to god if I have to spend another minute in the house with her I’m going to have a psychotic break.

I can understand why my wife wants her here but she is driving me insane. Since I’ve been working at home, she’s interrupted my work at least twice a day to tell me what I “should” be doing. I’ve explained many, many times that I can do chores/take care of our son after I’m finished with work, but she continues to interrupt.

I have been cooking most nights, and she comments on my cooking every fucking night. Too bland or too spicy or too this or not enough that. But she doesn’t cook. She doesn’t even do the dishes. She just exists in the house following me around like a fucking demon telling me what to do. She could fix 95% of what she nags me about herself rather than bothering me while I’m working or actively trying to take care of something. SHES TOLD ME TO DO THE DISHES WHILE IM DOING THE DISHES! 

I’ve explained this to my wife and basically gotten a “too bad” answer every time. I can’t take it anymore. I’ve been taking my laptop in my car and working in my office parking lot using the my hotspot. I put a curtain behind the front seats for meetings so they can’t tell where I am. I’ve done this for three days and my wife has been telling me to stop. 

I told her I’m not going to stop until MIL leaves and my wife said it’s not fair to “pressure” her into making her leave early. I asked when she was planning on making her leave and I got the same answer I’ve gotten every other time, which is when she feels like it’s right. 

She told me to stop going to the parking lot again today, but when she went back to bed I went again, and I’m here now. AITA if I don’t stop  coming.

AITA for inviting my sons entire class except for one child because of his autism?,18033,Asshole,6619,dufzum,1573442748.0,"My sons 10th birthday is next saturday and me and my husband have been planned a party for him. To make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations ready 2 weeks in advance and I had my son pass them out Friday. We invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). Except for one child well call david. 

The school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a ""normal"" class once a week. David is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. From what I know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and I have nothing against either of them. However, there have been incidents with david before. Last year through friends I had heard that David had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. I don't know if I believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. There are other logistical problems as well (The party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end I decided to not invite david. 

Well, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. This got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. She told me that I am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. When I brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up.

I woke up and the two large pizzas they ordered were gone. They were like “yeah when they got here you were asleep” and asked me to pay a third since I “helped ordered the pizza.” I was really confused by this and said I was not going to pay third for food they ate. They were like “it’s not our fault you were asleep, you helped order the pizza.” I would be happy to pay for it if I got even one piece the morning after! I asked how the two of them (two small girls) even managed to eat two large pizzas and Sarah was like “well Matthew helped.” Matthew is Jamie’s boyfriend. I said then well Matthew should pay for his part. They got angry and said “you helped order it, we would have gotten something else if you hadn’t.”

AITA for accusing my brother of replacing my wife’s refrigerated breast milk with cow milk?,17990,Not the A-hole,2765,duoejq,1573482332.0,"My wife and I had our first baby a month ago. She prefers to pump a few bottles worth of milk at a time and feed the baby from the bottle. She stores the bottles in the fridge. 


My little brother has never had a girlfriend. He acts quite awkward around my wife and other women from what I’ve seen. He came to my house last week to see the baby and he noticed the bottles in the fridge. 


Yesterday, my wife and I, along with our baby, went over to my parent’s house. My brother knows since he’s in our family group chat. He texted me when I was at my parent’s house that he bought my baby some cool clothes and will drop them off. He knows my front door pin to get in. 


When I got home I saw the cool clothes he bought and thanked him via text. My wife bottle fed my baby that night with no issues. Today, however, she said the baby reacted very differently to the new bottle she fed her. She coughed much more than usual and spat out the milk, which never happened before. So, my wife tasted it and said it was cow milk, not her milk. She told me to taste it too and compare it with the two other bottles in the fridge. That bottle indeed tasted much more like cow milk than the other two.


My wife suspected it was my brother drinking her breast milk and swapping out that bottle with cow milk. I agreed that it would not be out of character for him to do that. I thought it was a bit fishy he would come by and drop off clothes, especially since that was the first time he would come to my house when no one was home. 


I called my brother and asked him why he would drop by when we were not home and why he couldn’t wait a few hours until we got home. He said he just bought the clothes from the nearby mall and it was more convenient to drop them off then. I asked him to please tell me the truth if he swapped my wife’s breast milk with cow milk and he vehemently denied it. I told him how we found out the bottle contained cow milk and what a coincidence it must be. He said he really doesn’t know, but I could hear the tremble in his words. I told him that my wife and I don’t believe him and if he doesn’t apologize now, we would tell our parents what happened and ask what they think. He once again denies doing anything so I hung up.

AITA for not specifying my medical condition to my SO?,18045,Not the A-hole,2137,hgw0f3,1593302288.0,"I (F31) met my boyfriend N. (M33) about a year ago. Few years ago I developed a medical condition which was treated by hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). This of course caused me to be completely unable to have my own children. 

Few weeks after I met N. I told him that I'm infertile, knowing that at our age this is important information and may be a deal breaker. He reacted pretty sweet, he told me that it's okay and he doesn't think of me less because of that. I asked him if he didn't mind never having children with me and he said we'll deal with that when the time comes. 

I think that was the moment when I should have corrected him or say anything, because there is nothing to deal with. By I thought to myself that maybe he meant adoption or something. 

The next time when I think I should've say something was when few months later his friend informed us that he and his fiance are expecting a child. They had some difficulties and apparently it took them several years to succeed. N. said that night: ""You see? The doctor told them they couldn't have children too and look, here they are! Miracle babies happen all the time!"". I just said something like ""Good for them."" and changed the topic. 

Two weeks ago he moved in with me. As we unpacked his stuff he said ""Okay, now we can start looking for some therapies for you. I managed to save some money, we can deal with that now"". I asked him WTF is he planning to deal with. He said, with my alegged infertility. I asked him again WTF does he mean ""alleged""? He said ""You know, like my friends, they were also supposed to be infertile and now they have a newborn at home"". I replied saying that I'm happy for them, but every case is different and in my case it's completely not possible because I don't have any uterus. He was furious, started to yell that I should have told him that in the first place, that I mislead him. From my point of view I told him enough and he is adult so he made conscious decision to stay with me. We fight about it ever since. 

So AITA for not telling him exactly what condition makes me sterile?

AITA for naming my dog Askim?,17941,Not the A-hole,1867,cpn67z,1565694405.0,"8 years ago I got a gorgeous chug. While extremely high I decided that the greatest dog name ever thought of is Askim, because when people ask me his name and I tell them about 50% of the time they’ll awkwardly bend down and ask my dog it’s name. It’s hilarious. 
I had my fun for the first few weeks but eventually everyone had just gotten used to the name and the joke faded away. Occasionally I’ll be chatting to someone that hasn’t met Askim yet and when they ask his name I have my little laugh but other than that it’s a dead joke. 
Well, I just moved into a new neighborhood with a great park that has lots of dogs and very chatty regulars. An elderly lady asked Askim’s name, said “what?” So I repeated myself and she turned to my dog and asked him his name. I quickly explained but instead of getting the usual chuckle she became extremely upset and felt very humiliated. Since then a couple of people at the park have approached me and told me they “heard about my joke” and that they didn’t appreciate pranks in a nice family park.

I honestly don’t get it, but since the people that have reacted well to my dog’s dumb name have been friends, coworkers and family and these strangers are having a very different reaction I’ll accept your judgement on it.

EDIT: it’s a always a little jarring to wake up to 650+ notifications, I’ll go through them at my own pace throughout the day.

I should have been clearer, but I guess I didn’t know how to spell it out until I saw you guys suggest it. I absolutely think that the reason for her reaction is that I made her feel foolish, and she undoubtedly thought I did that intentionally. This is a pretty close knit community and she sought support from her friends who just took her distress at face value and confronted me about it.

The truth is that I say the word “Askim” multiple times a day. I’m aware that the name originated in a joke but at this point it’s just a thing I call my dog. When going out I’m not looking for new victims or inviting people to get tricked, and I wasn’t trying to trick her, It was small talk and I didn’t even  think about it until I got a negative reaction. 

It’s been pointed out that elderly people can feel really insecure about their diminishing faculties and I know from personal experience that it’s very true. I really like the idea of posting an explanation on the community Facebook page, especially now that I know it’s Turkish meaning and that it’s a town in Norway and neighborhood in Sweden.",False,1565712856.0,2019-08-13 04:06:45

Both the woman and the kid are really annoying. I'm childfree and dislike being around children. This annoying toddler always screams and throws tantrums. I could deal with this until now. Roommate's girlfriend decided it was ok for her to move in without paying rent since she got kicked out of her parents house (wonder why?). I am very vocally not happy with this and I told the landlord immediately and he said he'd do something about it but never did. It's been a month so I'm not even sure if she can be legally evicted now, not that it's even in my hands now.

Best thing I can do now is just ignore the girlfriend and her kid. I don't acknowledge the kid, I bought a minifridge for my room so that she doesn't steal my food, I moved my tv and all my consoles from the living room into my room since I hate going out there now anyway. Apart from that business is completely normal. I smoke weed (legal, not against the lease so long as I do it on the balcony), have people over including my girlfriend who I have sex with, practice my instruments as loud as I want during non-quiet hours. I refuse to babysit for any amount of time for any reason. One time I was sleeping and got woken up to my door being knocked on and my phone vibrating. I saw a bunch of texts from roommate saying that they need me to babysit. I lied and said I was out which lead to them having to cancel their plans for the day.

Roommate's girlfriend HATES me and thinks I'm being selfish. Thinks that the baby needs to come first. She has no money and my roommate makes a lot less than me so she thinks I should be responsible for childproofing the house.

"AITA for being annoyed my girlfriend has started dressing ""weird"" recently?",17934,Asshole,3266,gaa8t7,1588198524.0,"My girlfriend always dressed comfortably and practically until recently; she works at a professional job, and she would usually wear jeans, sneakers, T shirts or sweaters, etc.

About a month ago, she had her friend shave both sides of her head, but leave hair on the top and back of her head. I wasn't a huge fan of it but she said she wanted it for a while, but she was too afraid of being embarrassed if it turned out badly. But now that everyone is working from home, nobody can go out, she took the chance and she loves it.

Then she bleached her brown hair to blonde. Then in a week she dyed it florescent green.

And she was buying a lot of new clothes, crop tops and tank tops, really loud patterned pants, platform sneakers that look like running shoes but have a sole that's like 3 inches tall? Just generally flashy and eccentric stuff. And whenever I ask, she says that this is more her style but she's just been more comfortable getting into it when there's less social pressure.

She's stopped wearing bras and that's also awkward because I can tell she gets stares

I asked what she's going to do when she has to go back to work, and she said she'd dress appropriately but obviously couldn't change her hair. But she didn't think that would be a problem, she'd been practically indespensable during the difficult time the company was having recently, and she couldn't see there being any trouble over hair.

I've said I also don't love her new look, and she's always like ""I don't look that different, like it's still me"" but honestly she does look really different.

We had a fight after I asked her a couple times to just wear normal things when we hang out together, and she got really upset with me over it, saying that she was just trying to have some fun and try something different and it was really rude of me to tell her how to dress

AITA for tricking my husband and taking him to the ER,17924,Not the A-hole,1848,f5mekc,1582030675.0,"My husband over the course of the last couple weeks has been complaining about testicle pain. It started out mild and then got worse and worse to the point where every couple minutes he doubles over in pain. 

I practically begged him to go to the doctor and he kept saying no and insisting that it would go away on its own. It got to the point where he can’t even drive because he loses concentration and would crash. 

Tonight he asked me to go get pain killers and I claimed to not know the kind he likes. He said just get any kind and I insisted he come with me to show me. He begrudgingly agreed and got in the car. He wasn’t paying much attention so I drove to the hospital.

When we got nearby he realized and got incredibly mad and yelled at me saying that I shouldn’t have taken him etc etc. I basically pushed him in and he’s with the doctor now.

I know there’s probably going to be hell to pay after but AITA?

Update: he had appendicitis. I don’t know why he felt it in the testicles, and the doctors didn’t either, but it was appendicitis. I think he was just describing it poorly to me but he insists he felt it in his balls. But thankfully he’s going to be fine. Wasn’t too mad either.",False,1582048449.0,2020-02-18 04:57:55
AITA For banning my brother from bringing his indian gf to my wedding?,17906,Asshole,4080,fcvpq1,1583276204.0,"Title sounds very bad and horribly racist, but let me clarify:

So my brother (He's 25) has been dating an American-born girl to indian parents since last year (She's 23). Her parents do not like their relationship because he's White and probably prefer her to find an indian man.

He has been trying to gain their approval but failing and from what he said, they continue to shrug him off and actively exclude him if she tries to bring him to her family events. 

This has annoyed me because my brother is one of the nicest people I know. In the mean time, I proposed to my girlfriend and we're sending out invites to everyone. I came to the difficult decision that since his gf's family will not accept him, we will not accept her. I talked it over with my girlfriend and told her how strongly I feel about this and she agreed.

I didn't want to spring this up on her, so I asked his gf if we could meet up and I sat down with her and explained that in good conscious, I could not invite her to our wedding if her family cannot accept my brother and I essentially boiled it down to ""if they don't want my brother, we don't want you."" I told her she will be banned from all of our future family events until something changes with her parents in regards to my brother. 

She got upset about it and this caused a huge divide in my family. My brother obviously is against it but I wanted to do it out of support for him. Other relatives agreed this was the right thing to do, but I've been seeking judgement from outside my family to gain a clearer perspective if I was being an asshole in making this decision?

EDIT: I just want to clarify to all the posters that I am NOT doing this to punish her or her family. She still hangs around her family a lot and given that her family is disrespectful to my brother, I feel that makes her toxic and I do not want toxic people at my wedding.

AITA for refusing to support my son's pregnant girlfriend until she takes a paternity test?,17890,Asshole,6845,e8ip8e,1575966246.0,"My son (24M) and his girlfriend (24F) have only been together for 6 months, and she is apparently 4 months pregnant with his baby. They have actually been friends since high school, and so my husband and I have known her for a few years as well. 

She is a lovely girl, but honestly she is not someone I had hoped would be the mother to my first grandchild. First of all, she is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic, and while she says she has been clean for 3 years, a relapse is always possible. She only finished high school with her GED, and she now works as a waitress full time. Her parents died years ago, so she is largely on her own.

Our family is considerably better off, and my son is joining his father's business, meaning his salary will be quite high and will only continue to grow. 

Since my son first told us she is pregnant, it can't escape my mind that he may not really he the father, and that she picked him out of potential others because he would be the ""best"" in terms of support. 

My son is pushing us to help her with some of her pregnancy expenses, and I told him we would under the condition that she get a paternity test first. He completely blew up at that, accusing us of disliking her (untrue) and not wanting to he grandparents (also untrue). He says he loves her and trusts her and that he can't wait to meet his baby. I get that, but I think he's being idealistic. If he wants our support, we want a paternity test first. If the baby is truly his then we would be happy to welcome her into our family and we would be happy to help her out. AITA?

I have also gotten a lot of messages from men who found out their child wasn't theirs after several years, who wish they had found out sooner.

AITA for refusing to meet my biological daughter ? (I gave up my parental rights years ago),17880,Not the A-hole,4843,e6avb1,1575543815.0,"Many years ago, I was married to man named Mark. 2 years into the marriage, I found out he was cheating on me and got the other woman pregnant. It was a huge blow because I too was pregnant with his child. I was only 9 weeks pregnant and was determined to abort the child and divorce him. He begged me to reconsider, and insisted I give our relationship a second chance, and so I did, albeit reluctantly. 

I had a very unhappy pregnancy and when I was 6 months pregnant, I learned that he never stopped seeing the other woman. He told me that he was torn and that he was in love with both of us. I wasn't willing to tolerate any of that bullshit, so I moved out and filed for divorce. I wanted him to disappear from my life, but being pregnant with his child made things difficult. 

I never bonded with the baby , and the baby being his offspring contributed to the negative emotions that I felt. 

I told him that I didn't want this baby. So when he got together with the other woman, I gave her the choice to adopt the baby, which she did. With that, I officially signed over my parental rights as soon as the girl turned 6 months old (I left the day she was born). When I left, I told Mark that I didn't want anything to do with the girl and the other woman was free to be her mother. 

I moved to another country and tried to leave that part of my life behind. I met a wonderful man and we got married. He knew all about my past and now we have 3 wonderful kids who are 9, 5 and 2 years old. 

Recently, my ex Mark contacted me out of the blue and told me that my biological daughter, who is 14 now, wants to meet me. Apparently, his wife had passed away and before she died, she confessed that she wasn't her biological mother. 

I'm torn. I don't want to meet this kid. It was very difficult for me to leave that part of my life behind. I was depressed for years. I reminded him that I gave up my parental rights years ago and that I wanted nothing to do with both of them. I planned on telling my kids about their half sibling once they were grown and mentally mature, not right now when they are still so little. I told him to never contact me again and hanged up.

AITA for not bringing homemade treats to the office Christmas party? And telling of co-workers who expected me to?,17869,Not the A-hole,1703,eliwde,1578464713.0,"
This happened a couple weeks back. I am 22 and I'm one of very few women in my office at work. It's me, one other engineer, and two ladies in HR and administration. It kinda sucks and I wanna get a new job once my 401k is vested

Otherwise, there are a lot of guys. Like 50 or so. Most of them older guys with families

We had a potluck style party, and I was assigned a dessert. Everyone was asked to bring something. 

I picked up cupcakes from Aldi the night before the party, and thought that was settled. But when I brought them in, a couple people started giving me some shit for not bringing something homemade. Specifically 5 of my male coworkers.

I knew a lot of my coworkers have wives or even daughters who cook for them, like they'll have lunch made every day, and they weren't getting shit said about that

I was like ""How many of y'all cooked your own stuff for this? Not your wife, not your daughters, you yourself got in the kitchen and did it? Come on, raise your hands. Anyone at this here table put any work into this themselves??""  and none of them could.

I was like ""cool, well I'm single and unless one of you wants to buy me a mail order bride or some shit, don't complain"" 

I was being facetious, like I honestly don't think it's cool that they all act entitled to do fuck-all at home, and I would want no part in that life...

But it caused some drama at work, the HR rep got secondhand word that I was comparing people's wife's to mail order brides or something. Stuffs cool now,i explained myself, but it seems like it ruffled some feathers

AITA for publicly telling my half sister to stay out of my life?,17855,Not the A-hole,1446,gjudzy,1589517022.0,"My half sister has a weird obsession with me. She stalks me on my social media profile and acts like a deranged ex. I'm pretty popular on Instagram, where I also post my art, so making it private is not an option. 

She is 17, and I haven't seen her in  years. The last time I saw her, she was 12 and it was at my grandfather's funeral. 

My biological father had an affair with one of my mum's friends when she was dying. It was sick and my poor mum found out about it 5 days before she passed away. The other woman was already pregnant with my half sister. 

I was 15 and old enough to know what that meant. I refused to live with my dad (courts allowed it) and started living with my maternal grandparents. My 2 older siblings were in college and they haven't talked to him in years. 

We chose to keep them out of my life and we like it that way. 

Whenever I, my husband or my siblings make any sweet post, she literally spams the comments section with comments about us abandoning her and our biological father. 

I keep blocking her, but she comes back with new IDs every time. I definitely think she is not in a good mental place, and needs help. Possibly professional help. 

The last straw was on mothers day, when I tried to post a beautiful tribute to my mom. I posted many pictures. Some of those pictures were beautiful family pictures and I edited my biological father out of them. 

She commented about me posting edited pics and abandoning our father. It was a long post, and she actually posted several old family pictures in her account. That post got a lot of attention, and people started asking me about it. 

Only this time, I didn't delete her comment or block her. I replied under her post and asked her to stay away from my life. All this time, I avoided a confrontation because I believed she was young and misled by her parents. But as a 17 year old, she should know better. 




This was my reply :

 "" I don't know about others, but for me and my siblings, just because our biological father decided to have sex with some rando, and cheat on our dying mum, doesn't mean we owe anything to him or the result of his indiscretions. Please respect our boundaries and leave my family alone. You are old enough to understand this and if it bothers you, consider therapy. This level of obsession with our lives is really unhealthy. I wish you and your family well. ""

AITA for bringing up to neighbor how his daughter still lives at home after he pulled me asside while I was shoveling to lecture me on why I shouldn't still be living with my parents?,17846,Not the A-hole,2050,f3k7v3,1581670752.0,"I've moved out 3 times so far. Moved away to Cali for a year and a half after highschool, didn't work out, moved back home.

after a few months I got place a couple towns over with 3 roommates. 2 of the roommates left halfway through forcing us to break the lease because we couldn't afford it. moved back home.

Moved out a third time after a couple months, did a year lease with my best friend at an apartment in the same town, then moved back home after because I'm leaving in 5 months to move to Georgia with my current girlfriend and nobody will sign a 5 month lease.

I don't feel great about it, but I'm 23 and for the third time I have been forced to move back in with my parents.

Yesterday I was out shoveling the driveway so it would be done before my parents woke up.

The next door neighbor was out too, and he comes over and asks me how things are going.

He very quickly mentions how I'm too old to still be living with my parents. I'm already embarrassed enough by it as it is, but I know I have solid plans to move out again in 5 months. I didn't think this was worth mentioning to him, as I feel like he has no business caring about his next door neighbor's lives.

I get heated very very quickly because I was honestly taken back by his comment. I stop him mid sentence and mention to him

""doesn't your daughter still live with you? your daughter who's like 35? your daughter, along with her husband and like what? 5? 6 kids? don't they still live here with you?""

he starts yelling that I'm rude to mention that, how it's not the same thing, how they have kids and it's a different circumstance, etc etc etc. 

I'm getting more and more frustrated, it's 7:00 in the morning and I have work in an hr. I decide to just walk away and continue shoveling when I see him start to fucking fling his driveway snow into my driveway! I'm like ""DUDE WHAT THE FUCK? ARE YOU 6???""
 
my dad wakes up around this time and sees us outside arguing so he comes out and starts arguing with him himself. I go back inside and get ready for work and here I am after work wondering if I crossed the line by mentioning his daughter. I really don't think I did but it's starting to eat at me a bit.

tl;dr neighbor tells me I'm too old to still live at home so I bring up the fact that his even older daughter and husband still live with him, along with their 5+ children.

AITA for expecting a guy who invites me to his house for a movie date at dinner time to offer drinks or food?,17838,Not the A-hole,3959,cubq3j,1566582997.0,"The setup: I’ve known this guy for a couple years and we’ve worked together occasionally. We’ve had a couple dates before. We split the bill without any discussion or issue. 

He Snapchats me one day to come over to his place that night and watch a movie he has. I say sure.

I forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point I replied “pizza and a movie” and he replied “yeah see you soon!” It was just an innocent phrase but I didn’t eat that day and assumed we’d get food together.

I show up and he has the movie. I say “so are we getting food?” 

He says “I already ate. But I’m sure you have apps on your phone if you want something.” Then he leaves to go to the bathroom.

I sit there awkwardly. This guy previously talked about being a men’s rights guy. A normal one, not an incel dickhead. He also mentioned he’s low on cash. But isn’t it just good manners to offer guests in your house food or some shit? If he was too broke I’d obviously be happy to get him something, but that wasn’t the vibe I got since he bragged about a new game he bought. 

He returns and turns on the TV and turns off all the lights. Then he goes into the kitchen, which I assume is to get alcohol. 

I call out casually “what do you got to drink?” 

He calls back “Do you like tap water?”

This is not some red pill bullshit. I know this guy, he’s serious. There’s nothing in his fridge but muscle milk, water, and kale. 

I call out, “Yeah, sure.”

He brings me back a glass of tap water. He winks at me.

I’m starving. I haven’t eaten since 8am. 

I say “Hey, I don’t wanna be weird, but I thought we were getting pizza.” 

He says in a sympathetic tone, “Oh. I see. You must have been confused. YOU mentioned the food, not me. I should have cleared that up, I ate earlier. Sorry if that wasn’t clear. We can still get a pizza if you want. Just pick anywhere nearby and order it.”

This is still kind of shitty to me, but I ignore it and order one large pizza. The pizza shows up. I eat two slices of it. The rest of it sits there the entire movie. He doesn’t offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. He tries to make out with me during the movie. I stop him and feel too weird to be into it. 

After the movie, I decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. I tell him my feelings and how he’s weird with money and I’m uncomfortable. He feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. There was no bad intention at all. No red pill, no plan, nothing. Just a dude who didn’t think my pizza was his responsibility. 

Then he asks me to have sex with him.

I decline. Knowing we still have to work together, I manage to tiptoe out the door.

I don’t expect or need people to buy me things, but I think offering houseguests food when you invite them over at dinner time is a sign of good manners. (And then they can offer to split the tab)

I’ve been a single father since she was about 3 years old as I got sole legal custody due to some addiction issues her mother has. We have a really good relationship, but I always worry about her not having a woman to talk to. 

Over the past few months she hasn’t really seemed to be herself, I know she went through a bad break up but I’ve been worried it’s more than that. I’ve tried talking to her, and my sister only lives down the street so she’s tried talking to her also, but my daughter is really keeping to herself and it concerns me. 

She went out to see her friends for the first time since quarantine started yesterday and asked me if I could give her room a quick tidy whilst she was gone. I agreed because she does a lot of chores but she’s not good at cleaning her room. Whilst I was putting clothes back in her closet, I stumbled upon what I now know to be her diary. 

I shouldn’t have read past the first page but I just wanted to know if there was anything going on she wasn’t telling me about. There were some pretty heartbreaking stuff for a father to read about how down she felt about herself, so when she got home I brought it up to her. 

She asked me why this was suddenly coming up and when I told her I’d read her diary she absolutely flipped and told me it was an absolute violation of privacy and she’s completely humiliated.

WIBTA if I reported a nurse for breaking HIPAA rules?,17806,Not the A-hole,1113,gw5skw,1591257050.0,"I (18F) had my mom schedule me an appointment for severe abdominal pain. She forgot that I had switched clinics a couple of months ago, so she made me an appointment at my old kids clinic. Because of corona, we scheduled a FaceTime appt.


During my appt, the only questions the nurse asked me were coronavirus related. Since she wasn’t asking me about my pain, I told her my symptoms. I also mistakenly thought she was a different doctor I saw last year, and she took great offense to that. For the rest of the appointment, she was curt, rude, and when I tried to apologize for mistaking her for someone else, she ended the FaceTime call. The entire appt lasted 7 minutes.

Because I had such a bad experience, I went back to my clinic. The doctor I saw there was kind, knowledgeable, and immediately knewwhat to do. He ordered an x-ray, and I got the X-ray as soon as our appt was over.

So for some reason, the X-ray was sent to the first nurse instead of my doctor. She called my mom to ask for my phone number, since she cannot legally talk to my mom without consent from me. During this phone call with my mom, these are some of the things she said:


-My poor diet is to blame for my pain ( I eat a very balanced diet and she didn’t ask me about it, how would she know?)


-She accused me of lying to my mom about my symptoms. She said that as an 18 year old, I was too embarrassed to tell my mom the truth. She also said that I was constipated and I had blood in my stool (neither of those are true). 


-She said that I was too focused on going to parties to care about my health (I do not party)


- She said that I spent the entire appointment backpedaling for my mistaking her for someone else, and wasted the appointment.


-She said that although I am 18, I am not mature enough to care about my health, make my own decisions, and said I was no different than a child.


-After she attacked me for my character, she discussed the results of the X-ray with my mom. I’m pretty sure this is illegal. She admitted to my mom that she wasn’t allowed to discuss my medical information with her, and that it was illegal, but she did it anyway. Unfortunately the phone call was not recorded.


-She never ended up getting my phone number from my mother (which is on file so she didn’t need it anyway), so I believe she meant to call my mom this whole time


When my mom told me what she said, I started crying and was very angry. I think what she did is illegal, I never signed any consent forms allowing doctors to share my medical information with anyone else.


So here’s the part where I could be an asshole. I don’t care if my parents see my medical information. Her discussing my X-ray results with my mom does not hurt me at all. However, based on her other behavior and the fact that she did break the law, I want to report her. Although I know what she did was wrong, I would be reporting her out of spite and anger.

AITA for hiding my friends laptop because he imposed restrictions on me in my house?,17784,Asshole,1201,fvzeec,1586211005.0,"I know the title sounds bad but please hear me out.

This is my first year in college. Everything is working out fine EXCEPT for my roommate. Ever since I moved here I just can’t stand him. Why? I can write a whole story about why I despise this person but I don’t wanna keep this long so I will just mention the key points.

1. He is really messy. His room is a total mess (not that I sleep there but I don’t have TV in my room and sometimes have to go to his room for it. NOTE that we are paying equal rent so he isn’t doing me a favor for it).
2. He used to not even wash his plates until I told him I am not washing for him.
3. He would leave a mess everywhere until I had to explain to him like he is a little kid as to why it’s not good to have a dirty house.
4. Bathroom smells horrible whenever he leaves it. He can’t even clean the toilet after use.

Luckily though, I would rarely see him because I would spend most of my times at either the library, gym or with friends or my girlfriend after classes. Now though, because of what is happening, I must stay in the house which is killing me.

I now have to work out and study at home. I like to jump the rope as a cardio exercise for 10-15 minutes which can make some noise. 2 days ago, while I was exercising he told me to stop jumping rope and find something else because I make too much noise. I got so pissed off because I never complain when he does things that bother me but now he can’t even handle some noise for 10 minutes? I told him I won’t stop so he just went back to his room. Yesterday though when I wanted to work out again I couldn’t find my rope. I asked him if he has seen it and told me he HID IT from me and will give it back to me when he finishes studying as he can’t concentrate. I got so pissed off because again IT’S JUST 10-15 MINUTES, maybe 20 with breaks in between. I never complain when he bothers me but he can’t even handle this. Because of this, I hid his laptop when he was out today. While I was working out, he asked me if I had seen his laptop and I told him I will give it to him after I finish working out. He said he has an online exam tomorrow and that he needs it now to revise but I refused to give it. I’m physically stronger than him so he can’t do me anything either. He just went back to his room.

Well. When I finished working out he asked for the laptop back. I went outside to get it but I couldn’t find it anymore. I think someone must have stolen it. I told him I couldn’t find it and he told me that if I don’t give his laptop back today he will press charges on me but he has no proof so I doubt it will work. He is blaming me for stealing his laptop but I just hid it because he tried imposing restrictions on me. I didn’t know it will get stolen. Today I even caught him stalking me on social media. I called him out on this.

We have a 4 year old daughter and and a 3 month old son. Our son has a health condition and needs to be fed every 40 to 80 minutes. 

I work in IT and can easily work from home and generally make my own schedule. My husband works from 6am to 3pm. I get up every hour at night to feed our son so my husband can sleep. I drop our daughter off at kindie in the morning and then work and look after our son. I obviously don't get much sleep during the night so I have started to go to sleep from 3.30 to 7pm and I made it clear that I am not to be woken up unless it's an emergency. My husband looks after the kids and cooks tea while I'm asleep and at 7 we all eat. After that we take turns reading stories to our daughter as a bed time ritual. She's usually down for the night at 8. Then my husband and I have us time form 8 to roughly 9.30 which is when he goes to sleep. After that it's only me looking after our son so my husband can sleep through the night. I usually do some more work and go to sleep at around midnight but obviously very interrupted sleep since I have to get up every hour. 

My husband has started complaining recently. He doesn't think I should sleep in the afternoon because during that time childcare is on him completely. He wants some time to relax when he gets home.

He obviously grew up with her so he’s very used to everything she needs. When we go to visit my in laws, it always seems to me like their entire livelihood revolves around her. She also throws big tantrums when she doesn’t get what she wants. There ends up being a lot of yelling from all sides. I find the whole environment so stressful and tense, but it’s what they’re used to. 

My husband’s parents are getting older and I think it’s getting more difficult to care for her. My husband approached me a few weeks ago saying he thinks it’s time his sister comes to live with us. My whole world came to a screeching halt. We had talked about us helping financially and coordinating care before, but never about her actually coming to live with us. 

In truth, I just can’t picture us staying afloat while adding her into the mix at our house. We have three kids under 6. It’s a madhouse here all the time already. If she lived here, we’d need to have all three kids in one bedroom. We’d also need to get some serious modifications to our house because it’s not handicap friendly. Also, I  truly think this would ruin the relationships we are building with our kids. I think my husband and I would have to spend so much time and energy caring for his sister that we wouldn’t be able to focus on our own kids. This breaks my heart and is the big dealbreaker for me. 

I suggested moving his family closer to us (they currently live 5 hours away) and seeing how we can help without them living with us. I said we need to start looking into some appropriate assisted living facilities and he flipped out on me. He says he promised his mom he’d take care of his sister, she’s his blood, etc.  I understand it’s his sister, but I also feel he has his own new family to consider, too, that he’s completely ignoring in this equation. 

Obviously this is a big fuckup on both of our parts to not discuss this in detail much earlier on. I can’t picture us managing this with three kids, and it just makes me sad to think of us 30+ years down the road when we’re “empty nesters” and always having his sister there by our side. To be honest, if I knew his sister coming to live with us forever was a total mandatory for him, it might have meant the end of our relationship.

Edit: wow this post blew up a little bit. Thanks for everyone’s replies. I am reading through them and it’s helpful to see from all sides. I do want to clarify that it’s not that we hadn’t talked about this at all. We had talked about it, but the extent of support we had talked about was financial support and coordinating outside care. We had never discussed her coming to live with us. I understand it was a miss to not discuss that overtly, but it felt like we had a solid plan before that about helping in all other ways and getting her proper care as she and we get older.

AITA for not letting my friends enter the Forbidden Room?,17770,Not the A-hole,1325,fwpmjz,1586312442.0,"OK, this is a throwaway, on mobile, English isn’t my first language, etc.

So I (M20) live with another guy (M19), who I’ll refer to as Red. Red’s autistic, and he’s not a party person. I am. He also is extremely camera-shy, like he’ll go out of his way to hide if someone is taking a photo that he could appear in. That’s perfectly fine, but I still like my parties. So we came up with the Forbidden Room. The Forbidden Room is a small room we have, that we made super comfortable with a fuckton of pillows, a mattress, and noise-cancelling headphones. Whenever a party stresses him out, or people are taking a lot of photos, he locks himself in the Forbidden Room. There’s two keys, one is with me, the other is with him.

I never specified what the Forbidden Room is. I only told people it’s locked, and so they can’t access it. (Which is true — Red unlocks it to enter). The arrangement works great for Red and I. A few days ago, someone in the group WhatsApp casually mentioned Red disappears in parties, so I mentioned the Forbidden Room’s purpose. (Red knew I was telling them.) 

My friends are all now mad at me, because that’s not a real reason to lock up a room, and that they like Red, and want to chill more with him, and by doing this, I’m essentially allowing him to remain socially distant from others. They’ve demanded entry next time to the Forbidden Room, and I’ve denied them; and they tried to compromise by saying anyONE can have a downtime in the room, and I’ve refused that.

Red’s argument is, he can’t tolerate being social for very long, and some of my friends have taken pictures and posted them online without his permission, and created a scene when he asked for it to be taken down; and that he doesn’t trust they’ll use the Forbidden Room responsibly, and it doesn’t solve his need to hide in a place on his own.

So, AITA for having a forbidden room that only Red is allowed in?

EDIT: this got a lot of attention overnight. I’m gonna try and read through this with Red, once he’s up. 

Some points of clarification:

-  I’m not throwing parties at the moment

- a few said it’s super obvious that I’m NTA, but honestly, based on my friends response to me wanting Red’s Forbidden Room to stay intact, I might as well have committed a crime, to the point I second-guessed myself.

- I am no longer second guessing myself, the Forbidden Room is staying.

EDIT #2

- Red and I are reading through all of your comments. He says hi! and to all his autistic friends, he recommends a Forbidden Room.

- He also says thanks, and this made him feel significantly less crazy for having the need to disappear.

AITA for asking my wife for an abortion.,17766,Not the A-hole,2300,dgz2ph,1570934445.0,"Me (31m) & my wife (29f) are very vehemently childfree. We’re not one of those nutters who calls kids crotch fruit or spawn or whatever godforsaken name there is, but it was an agreement that we had very early in the relationship that we wouldn’t have kids.

Now I’ve been putting off getting a vasectomy, I did get one a few weeks ago but I was just procrastinating it which was my fault I guess. However I used condoms and my wife has been on birth control since she was 14, so we were all good. So about 2 weeks before the vasectomy, me and the wife were getting down to business and I realized that I’d ran out of condoms, she reminded me that she’s on birth control so we proceeded with the deed. I go get some
more condoms after, vasectomy happens, and  everything’s all good.

Nope. She’s now six weeks pregnant, I was surprised cause isn’t she supposed to be on birth control? Come to find out that she hasn’t been taking it for at least a few months now. On top of that, she wants to keep the kid which I am very against, she’s very fucking ecstatic which shocked me cause obviously she’s against having kids too. I feel so damn betrayed in this situation, she knows I’m very against kids and not only that but I was a foster child and don’t know anything about my parents so I have no clue what inheritable diseases I may have. 

I really don’t want to have a kid. So much so that I’m thinking of divorcing her if she’s not willing to get rid of it, and to be honest I might divorce her anyways cause of the crap she pulled with the birth control. 

I have told her that I’m against this pregnancy but I haven’t pushed any further than that. Would I be the asshole for possibly divorcing her over this, or asking her to get an abortion?",True,False,2019-10-12 19:40:45

Last year I got pregnant and they were ""happy"" because my daughter is the first grandchild. Well, now my daughter is three weeks old and my family didn't want to come to meet her because my sister, who decided to get pregnant after knowing that I was pregnant, doesn't want them to come to visit me and my husband because she thinks my husband is ""infected"", she is obsessed with the virus that is affecting many people lately (the virus that started in China)
My mother avoided my texts for weeks and when I sent her pictures of my daughter she didn't even answer me. And one of my sisters even made fun of my daughter's eyes, I sent her a picture of her and she said ""oh she has *chinky eyes* like *my husband's first name*"" I tried to ignore that kind of comments but I had enough.


Yesterday they decided that they wanted to come to meet our daughter so they showed up at my house with gifts for her but I didn't open the door and when she called me to tell me that they were outside I said that we only accept visits from family members and that they are no longer my family, and my mom ""cried"" and told me that she has the right to meet her first granddaughter that I was being cruel but I told her to shut the fuck up and I hung up the phone.
Today my sister (the one who said that my daughter has chinky eyes) sent me a text saying that she is very sorry and that she wants to meet my daughter but I told her not to contact me anymore because for me they are dead and I blocked all my ""family"" from everywhere.

AITA for suggesting that my trans friend wear a towel at a Japanese sauna?,17758,Not the A-hole,640,cdo1b6,1563256301.0,"I am a 20 y/o girl. I am in Japan on exchange with some friends of mine. Most of my friend group are women, including a 21 y/o trans woman. She was born a male and started transitioning in her teens. Currently she is pre-op and saving up for gender reassignment surgery. However, you can hardly tell that she used to be a male, save for her voice and height/body frame.

Anyways, yesterday night, a bunch of girls (5 or so) from my classes decided to go to a nearby onsen, or Japanese bath house. Basically, you are expected to get completely naked. Everything is gender segregated. There is a separate men’s section and women’s section.

My friend who is trans also wanted to go. So we all went as a group. Everyone in our group knows that she is trans and pre-op, but I think everyone was uncomfortable talking about the issue of being naked in the bath house. Finally, when we were in the changing rooms, I quietly suggested to her that she should probably wrap a towel around her hips instead of going completely naked.

She asked me why and I told her that many of the bathers would probably be a bit alarmed to see male genitalia in the bath house. She got mad at me and said sarcastically, “Thanks for your concern.” In the end she opted for the towel, but another friend overheard and said I was out of line for suggesting it. They both thought it was none of my business. I explained that not everyone is so accepting of her body and that I’m just trying to protect her from comments, stares, or worse.

They avoided me in the bath house after that although my friend did wear a towel around her waist the whole time. There were some looks but not as bad as if she didn’t wear a towel.

I apologized afterwards to my trans friend and said I meant no disrespect. But she still seemed mad at me and are telling people that I am transphobic, although I do not believe that I am. AITA?",True,False,2019-07-15 22:51:41
AITA for continuously asking my in laws about their tradition of women eating after men?,17729,Not the A-hole,3104,g1u1ij,1586993109.0,"Am not a native English speaker, so sorry for any mistakes.

When I (F) first met my husband's family, I noticed they had a tradition where all the females (it's a huge family living together) would cook the food together and the men would eat first after which the women would eat. I didn't initially comment on it, not wanting to get into a conflict with people I didn't know too well.

As years passed though, I got more annoyed with this tradition. For one thing, the food would be cold by the time I (and other women) begin to eat. We also usually visited during holidays and festivals, and a lot of expensive delicacies that is not normally prepared otherwise is made then, and I don't always get any because their might not be leftovers. Not to mention, I help cook, so it seems absurd to me that I have to wait hungry while others are done. None of the other women seem to mind this.

A few months back, before eating, we were all in the living room and I thought I would ask them about this.

Me: Can we all eat at the same time?

FIL: No. This is an old tradition in our family because men would be really hungry after  coming back from work.

Me: Most of the women work nowadays though.

FIL: It seems really wrong to suddenly stop something we have been doing for so long now.

This continues on for a while - FIL insisting it's a tradition and shouldn't be broken and me saying it's sexist. Nothing changed, men ate first like usual, and I dropped it. However I had several of my husband's relatives  come up to me and say that I am an asshole for questioning their traditions, and that I don't stay with them and asking this makes me an asshole. A lot of the women also think I am an asshole because they think I made a big fuss about nothing.

AITA for letting a guy quit while I was firing him so I wouldn’t have to pay severance?,17728,Not the A-hole,2619,esrtrc,1579807816.0,"I’m a small business owner and I had to let one of my employees go today. 

I called him in and began to explain that he was being let go and why, and he stops me and goes on a bit of tirade, you know, “I’m the one who makes this place run. I’m the last guy who should be getting fired.” And I was sitting, letting him get it out of his system. Then he says: 

“And what’s more, you can’t fire me. You can’t fire someone who doesn’t work here. *I*. *QUIT*.” So I seized the moment and said “You’re quitting?” 

And this is the PG version but basically he said  “You’re damn right I am!” And I said “So you’re resigning your post, you are choosing to not work here anymore, you are leaving your job?” 

He said yes, he said a few other things, he left. I processed his removal as though he’d quit. I no longer had to pay him severance of any kind. 

Now I feel a bit badly. Because I know getting fired is tough and you sometimes react off the cuff, I’ve been there. 

But he did go on a loud, insulting, profanity laced tirade making statements against me and his coworkers and our clients, and most importantly, he really he did quit.

AITA for telling my (23f) bf (26m) I’m uninterested in having kids with him after saying he’d love it more if it’s a boy?,17719,Not the A-hole,1926,f5er22,1581998973.0,"So my bf and I have been together a year. We had an instant connection from the beginning but took 4 months to actually date (in total we’ve been involved for 16mths). We talk all the time about having children and marriage when I’m done with school/when he’s paid off all his student loans from university.

When talking about the future of kids, he’s said many many times he’d rather have a boy than a girl. Everyone has preference, it’s fine. 

So last night watching a movie about a family w multiple kids, I jokingly said he would love our kids more than he loves me. (I think that’s normal to love kids more than spouse sometimes, and it was a complete joke I didn’t think he’d even respond to.)

He got a serious tone and said “if it’s a boy I will, not if it’s a girl”.

I told him that if he has that deep rooted resentment towards women and is that sexist in a way, we shouldn’t have kids as that’s not the proper mindset to have nor should gender decide how much you love them. 

He said it’s rude I’d tell him that I don’t want to have his kids now and that his mindset is normal and many men love their sons more than daughters.

To me, his mindset/ability to only love a boy that much feels like he thinks the opposite sex (women) are lesser compared to men. I’m not easily offended, but this seems like if he had a son he’d raise it the same way, which is concerning

UPDATE; thank you SO MUCH to everyone who commented with experiences, opinions, and different viewpoints than mine! I was NOT expecting this to blow up how it did. 

For those that came to the conclusion I wanted to be told I’m right, I didn’t make this post to be told I’m NOT the asshole, he genuinely made me feel like a nut case for having an issue with his beliefs. I felt guilty for not wanting his children. 

I talked to him and told him that I can’t be in a relationship with someone who I can’t have kids with and that I feel doesn’t respect me simply bc I have a vagina. He said he was kidding and I’m being too sensitive and I didn’t understand him (lol). Once he thought I was serious he said he would chanfe. I educated him on why his viewpoint is sexist and hope he changes to be a better man for someone else. 

I believe he loved me and we were meant to be together for some period of time but we weren’t compatible when it came to our views on topics like what I posted about. He took it well but was in disbelief I was “overreacting so much”. His idea of this came from his father and growing up he was told women are inferior and having boys is ideal. He said with the break up he’d be going to stay in Pennsylvania with his father for a bit, for anyone worried about what could happen after. 

Yes there’s a possibility his mindset could change, but I’m not willing to train a 26 y/o to see my worth as a woman. This is a huge deal breaker for me. 

I’m heartbroken and so sad as this is the person I’m in love with, HOWEVER, life will go on and I’m better off without someone that doesn’t see me (or our potential babies) as en equal bc of my gender. Thanks everyone!

UPDATE UPDATE- please don’t message me about my opinion of men and women being equal being wrong. You won’t change it. I’m getting very nasty messages for leaving this person, but it was my choice. After thinking back to other instances he overall DID see me as inferior and was sexist, I just didn’t think much into these things bc he was good to me. Gonna say again, this man loved me I know, but if you do not see someone as your equal you can’t love them fully (which he’s given an example of by saying this about potential daughter).",False,1582043292.0,2020-02-17 20:09:33
AITA for kicking my disabled mother out of my house because she isn't accepting of my gay relationship?,17716,Not the A-hole,1769,gv8cza,1591137073.0,"My mother is widowed, without many funds and suffering from heart failure, with an ejection fraction of less than 15% and a bunch of other stuff wrong with her. She isn't eligible for a transplant for a number of reasons and at this point according to optimistic doctors she has another 10 years left. Before her diagnosis, she had a lot of money saved for retirement but since then, to pay for all of the medical expenses she has and her expensive meds on a monthly basis she's had to sell her home and move in with me, her only child. 

So I've been letting her live with me rent free for about three years now since she fell sick. Things have mostly been fine, but that's because I haven't been in a relationship during this time. I've had relationships in the past that would end because of my fear of my parents finding out, who were always extremely homophobic, especially my mom. My mom isn't homophobic with the excuse of religion, she just blatantly hates the entire LGBT movement and has said some incredibly hurtful things over the years without knowing I'm gay that have stuck with me all my life. She's also racist. But, she's my mother, so I accepted her into my home because she didn't have anywhere else to go as no extended family could or were willing to accommodate her.

A few months ago I met my current boyfriend, we'll call him Steve. I decided that I'll have some balls and tell my mom I'm gay and introduce Steve to her afterwards judging by her reaction, since she literally lives with me I thought just maybe she could sit and bear it and then find out for herself that her entire world view is wrong after seeing us together for a while. Not only did she tell me she's disappointed in me and started crying about how she should have raised me better, she told me I was going to catch aids and die if I stay with him.

I told her she has a month to find other living accommodations and that she can't stay here, and that I don't care where she goes as long as she gets out of my house. I said this quite calmly and gave her notice to find someplace, so I think I didn't do anything wrong but other members of my family think that I've practically made my mother homeless, and since no one else wants to accommodate her and she has no funds and a severe disability she'll end up in a shelter. Honestly, it's not my problem anymore. I'm sick of sacrificing for her when she can't even accept me for who I am, so if she's homeless, she had it coming.

But anyway, do you think I'm the AH?

Edit: Sorry if this wasn't clear, but she met Steve a week after I originally came out. There's some extra info in my comments if you want more background on my childhood or her beliefs, it wouldn't fit the word count if I pasted them all here.

Edit 2: Read my reply to u/nihil_esque 's comment if you want more info, but after reading through all of the comments I've decided to give my mom a 6 month grace period to get used to me being gay and if she still can't tolerate me after that I'll personally put her in an assisted living facility.",False,1591139781.0,2020-06-02 15:31:13

AITA for threatening to kick my sister and her children out during a global pandemic?,17702,Not the A-hole,1939,gqaa76,1590439186.0,"My (20F) sister (30F) has two kids (5F and 7M) She recently divorced her husband and is temporarily staying with me because she has nowhere else to go. She could move in with our parents but for some reason, she decided to stay with me for a few days. Few days turned into months because of the pandemic and so, here we are.

I honestly don't mind. I love her, and I love the kids. What I can't stand is her behaviour. Bear with me. This is going to sound very bizarre. 

My sister is very religious. She has a facebook group, whatsapp group and an instagram where she has about 5000 followers. She's probably also on reddit and many other social media.

Usually, she's nice and sweet, but lately, she's become somewhat crazy. She has these “sessions” with her kids every few days. These “sessions” last about half an hour. During these sessions, she teaches her kids about the LGBTQ community. Not good things, but she teaches them about how being gay is a sin and all of that. Being Transgender is a disease. How to avoid getting infected etc. She tells them to repeat words after her, and then makes a video and uploads it everywhere.

It's very very bizarre. She gets a lot of likes on social media where like-minded people praise her and upload similar videos of them having these “sessions” with their kids. She's part of this group trying to “lead the new generation to the right path” Her little daughter who is five has the sentences memorized. “Being gay is a sin. You will burn in hell” is her answer if you ask her “What do you think about gay people?”

The problem is I'm bisexual. My sister conveniently forgets that. “No, you're not. You'll get over it when you meet the right person” is what she tells me when I mention it.

This is my house. I will not tolerate her disrespecting me in my own home. I told her that as long as she stays in my home, eats my food, uses my things, she's not allowed to have these “sessions” in my living room. This led to a massive argument where she bragged about her followers, refused to listen to me, insulted me and refused to apologize. 

I ended up threatening her. I told her she can't live here if she behaves this way which made her cry. Now I'm the heartless, selfish asshole in my family who threatened to kick her poor divorced sister and her little kids out in the middle of a global pandemic. I would obviously never do that to her. I only wanted her to stop being homophobic. Besides, she can always go to our parents.

I have apologized countless times, even to my parents, but I'm being repeatedly called heartless. Am I the asshole for wanting my sister to stop being homophobic? Am I the asshole for threatening her to get her to stop?

*Edit: Looks like this post summoned all the homophobes to one place. I get that it's a sin in your religion, but I don't fucking care. Can you please refrain from sending me insulting messages telling me ""accept it, bitch""? Read and move on. You don't have to go out of your way to be so mean.*

AITA for praising my son differently than my daughter?,17699,Asshole,1547,gq0sti,1590395251.0,"Throwaway account + obligatory mobile formatting apology.

I (52M) am the father of 3 kids, 15F, 7F, and 7M. The last two are twins and are very close, having the tendency to copy each other. I love and adore them all equally.

My son is not a very masculine kid, and is less interested in some of my hobbies because of this. He has always preferred whatever his mother and older sister did, like baking or dancing. I have no problem with this, I love him as he is, but to be honest, I’m slightly disappointed that we haven’t had the kind of amazing father-son bonding that I got to have with my Grandpa (my Dad died when I was pretty young) when I was a kid.  

Since I’m at home almost all the time now, I’ve been seeing just *how* feminine his interests have gotten. Asking to help cook every meal, helping his older sister alter second-hand clothes, and playing pretend. He’s even asked to have his sister paint his nails. I’m not upset or bothered by it, but it isn’t typical for young boys. 

I’ve been working out at home instead of at the gym because of our current circumstances, and when my son came in while I was lifting weights in the family room, he showed an interest in it. He was excited about the idea of having big muscles, and tried out some of the 5lb ones. Even though he mentioned being like She-Ra (from some new Netflix reboot, I think?), it was still progress in my eyes and it seemed like he was showing interest in masculine hobbies. I praised him and did the whole *”wow, you’re so strong!”* thing in kid-talk to encourage him. 
 
When his sisters walked in, the twin (7F) joined in. Like I said, they have the tendency to want to do what the other is doing so she expected the same kind of “wow, so strong!” stuff. When I wasn’t as enthusiastic with her and focused on my son, my oldest got annoyed and asked why I was treating them differently. I explained to her that because he hadn’t taken interest in these kinds of masculine hobbies before, I wanted to foster his own identity as a boy separate from his twin sister. She accused me of being misogynistic for this! She then said that I was TA for making his sister feel weaker and implying that I didn’t approve of his feminine interests. I don’t think I’m TA, because there’s no reason for my daughter to be inclined towards this kind of thing, but my son should be developing a more masculine personality as he gets older. 

When she told my wife (41F), she also blew up at me, saying I was acting like a cartoon misogynist. Both of them are pissed. So, Reddit, AITA?


|Edit:| Hey everyone. I was 100% TA. I appreciate that some people tried to empathize and say NTA or NAH to be charitable, but I’m in the wrong here and I knew it deep down while I was writing the post. Re-reading it, I feel ridiculous for writing that all out. I want to say thank you, because these comments where the objective kick in the ass I really needed! I realize now that I was really out of line for saying that shit and making my daughters feel that way. I set up a stupid false dichotomy, and my daughter was very right, I was being a misogynist. No excuse for that. I apologized to both of them and my wife an hour after I posted. I also shared this post with my little brother, who, as I mentioned in a comment, was teased for being effeminate as a kid/teen, especially after he came out. I think some people took me mentioning that as blaming him, which wasn’t my intention at all- none of my behavior is his or anybody else’s fault. 

We talked for a while and that (along with many of the comments you guys left!)  made me aware of how badly I’m treating my son. My Grandpa, who raised my brother and I for most of our lives, was a “manly” guy who I’ve always idolized completely. Well, my brother made me aware that my Grandpa in particular made him feel shitty about his femininity and his sexual orientation. He would regularly say degrading, terrible things. I was oblivious to just how much that hurt him, and it seems that I’ve picked up some of these same ideas. I’ve been such a dick for so long, and now that I realize how absurd some of the ideas I’ve held onto are, I know how much of a disservice I’ve done to my boy. I shouldn’t try to make him change just to protect him from bullies. In this situation, I’m the bully as much as it hurts to think. 

I’m planning on talking with him about this issue and apologizing. If we can this week, I want to let him choose something that he likes that we can do together. I’m not going to make the same mistakes my Grandpa did. At my brother’s and some redditors’ suggestions, I’m considering trying out therapy or a support group. After a mistake (huge fuck up) like this, I think I ought to try to be the best dad (and big brother!) I can be and work to stop thinking that way, especially when I’ve already done so much damage. 

I’m sorry about the extremely long edit, but thank you for your responses and helping me with this issue. I showed my wife some comments and she also thanks you all!

|Edit 2|: This will probably be the final update, but wow! I’m overwhelmed will all the responses, I wasn’t expecting so many. Thank you to everyone, I’m glad you guys were honest (but still encouraging!). I’m sorry I haven’t been able to reply to you all. I got a lot of really kind and personal messages and I want you guys to know I’ve taken it to heart.

Some people asked what I’m going to do with my daughters, since it seems like I focused more on my son in the edit. My oldest wants to try Krav Maga, so in the coming weeks we’re hoping to find a place that’ll accommodate both ages. Youngest daughter has wanted to learn how to roller skate too, so my 15 year old may have to teach us both!

I was able to talk to my son for a while this morning and apologize for yesterday. Talking about gender roles and all the trauma surrounding my Grandpa may be something I’ll talk to him more about as he gets older, but I got the message across that I support whatever he’s interested in. I asked him about She-Ra (some commenters told me that it’s fun for adults too) and we watched a few episodes together. You guys were right! My oldest and I both thought it was very cute. I asked him what he would want to do together, and he mentioned trying to alter something. I brought down a box of my old stuff from the attic and lo and behold- I found one of the 80s Hawaiian shirts my grandpa bought me (probably an effort to make me look like Tom Selleck). With some guidance from my oldest, we’re going to try to make it fit my son with room for him to grow into it. I think it’ll turn out nicely, and because it’s “really vintage” my 15 year old loves it. 

So everything is pretty good right now. I invited my brother over (lives a few hours away) for dinner so my son and I can make him something. I can’t believe that I was feeling upset about him liking baking and everything, I’m lucky that my boy wants to help everyone. So, I’m definitely TA, but I’m slowly becoming NTA! Thank you all. I showed my oldest some of my favorite comments and she thinks they’re great and I should expect a “clown of the year” award for a father’s day gift, haha!",False,1590422141.0,2020-05-25 01:27:31
AITA for not disciplining my daughter for laying into a nosy woman at church?,17683,Not the A-hole,2000,cm2omo,1564987101.0,"My wife and I have one 14 yo adopted daughter, Sarah, which is relevant to the story. We recently found out that she has PCOS, which I'd never heard of before. Part of that is that she has a very large ovarian cyst that requires surgery to remove. The surgery is scheduled and happening soon. Right now, she looks pregnant, which can't be easy on a teenager. 

Between this illness and life in general, Sarah can be... moody and nobody in life is immune to fits of anger. Today at church, some woman decided that Sarah was in fact pregnant, and that it was her CHANCE at a free baby. Sarah went off on her, calling her a ""barren bitch"", among other things, and causing a major scene that left that woman sobbing. 

My wife thinks that Sarah has anger issues, and that we should punish her for not being sensitive. I don't agree.

First off, why is that woman entitled to say anything if Sarah WAS pregnant? Infertility doesn't make you exempt from social norms. I recognize that my wife and that woman have suffered, but they don't get to just do whatever. With her medical problems, Sarah will probably be infertile herself, which I think puts her on par on that point. Secondly, Sarah lashed out in a rage due to mental and physical pain while provoked by an outrageous encounter. I don't know that that's the same as having ""anger issues"" or a personality problem. I've had physical fights over less. Maybe that nosy woman needed to learn a lesson, and did.

AITA for letting our daughter get off scot free?

Ninja edit: Sarah will have to be on oral birth control for her entire life, and may actually lose at least one ovary in this surgery. I'd say she qualifies for infertility on those grounds. I don't know how it wouldn't.",True,False,2019-08-04 23:38:21
AITA for possibly making my parents homeless?,17684,Not the A-hole,1317,grza29,1590668237.0,"This isn't just me, it includes my twin brother. My brother and I (17m) were an accidental pregnancy. For context, our oldest sibling is 37 and has a kid who goes to our high school. Our nearest sibling in age is 28.

My parents always made it clear that we weren't supposed to exist. They were never abusive or neglectful or anything, but they were kind of cold our whole childhood. 

My brother and I will graduate high school in about a week, and will be 18 in two weeks. My parents have told us that as soon has we turn 18, we will have to pay rent. Neither of us have jobs, and we probably won't be able to get jobs right now.

I confided in my sister that I'm really stressed about this, and she offered to let my brother and I stay with her while we're in University, completely free of charge. I'm really grateful for this, and we're planning on accepting her offer.

I told my parents about this, and they freaked out. I guess my mom was planning to move to part time work and they needed rent from my brother and I to keep up with rent. They said that they have provided for us our whole lives, and we should pay them back now that we're almost adults. 

I mean, it's true. They have given us everything we needed for 18 years, and I really don't want them to be homeless if they can't afford the rent, but I don't know how I would even afford to live with them.

AITA?

Edit- my brother and I both have some savings, so we could conceivably pay rent for a few months. I also feel guilty moving in with my sister, because she has three little kids and a cat to take care of, and I don't want to put any extra strain on her. None of my siblings have a great relationship with our parents, so my parents won't ask them for help.

Edit #2- I'm actually shocked by the support here. I've been talking it over with my brother, and we're going to move out as soon as we legally can. Thanks guys.

AITA for not wanting my in-laws to visit our new baby?,17643,Not the A-hole,1641,ck7l97,1564603456.0,"Just to preface, my husband's brother has two kids, and his parents babysit them at least 3 days a week. I feel like this has kind of set the expectation for frequency of visits with grandparents. 

I just had a baby on July 10th, and my husband's mom has been over to visit us 5 times since then. I know she means well, but it's very stressful to have a newborn and to feel like I have to entertain also. It would be different if she was offering to help with something (not that I expect that of visitors, but people visiting new parents usually at least offer). She also seems to conveniently always come while he's napping (he naps for 2+ hours at a time at this point), and she leaves once he starts getting a little fussy, which is frustrating because any rest or chores I could get in while he's asleep don't get done. 

She texted me yesterday asking to come for a visit today. This is the first week my husband is back at work full time, and I'm trying to get in the groove of a new routine. I wrote her back and told her that I'm really not up for visitors this week because I'm getting settled in, and she freaked out and texted my husband asking what she did to offend me. She hasn't talked to me since yesterday after I wrote her, and she basically implied to my husband that we're being selfish keeping her grandson away from her.

AITA for having narcotic pain meds in my medicine cabinet?,17600,Not the A-hole,4272,eluqog,1578528644.0,"Throwaway because I'm gonna reveal some medical info and some IRL people know my main account.

Wife had a C Section about 3 months ago. She was prescribed Norco (Hydrocodone) for the pain. We filled the prescription (20 pills) and then she never took it. She used Motrin and Tylenol only. The pill bottle went into the medicine cabinet in the bathroom where we forgot about it.

Fast forward to Christmas Day. We don't want to take an infant around to all our families gatherings in flu season, so we stayed home and invited anyone over who wanted to stop by during the day.

My wife's sister (so my SIL) Jane and her boyfriend Bob came by. Jane and Bob have been dating for a few months. I never met the guy before. My wife met him once. My point is that I don't know this dude from Adam, but he seemed like a nice guy. They stayed for a while, played with the baby, exchanged some presents, and we all had a good time before they left to go to their next stop.

A few days later, Jane calls my wife irate and screaming. Bob stole the Norco. He is apparently a recovering addict who has been clean less than a year. We obviously didn't know this. He has now vanished. His work hasn't heard from him, his parents haven't heard from him, and Jane hasn't heard from him. He could be on a bender or dead for all we know. Jane went to his apartment when he wasn't responding to her and that's when she found the empty pill bottle with my wife's name on it and called us screaming.

SIL blames us and is beyond pissed, which I can understand. She needs an outlet for her anger. What I don't understand is about half the family blames us too. They understand we didn't know about Bob's addiction history, but they said having unused narcotic medication just sitting around is irresponsible and we created this problem. It's causing a bit of a rift between the people blaming us and those not blaming us, and we (and my mother and father-in law) are caught in the middle because SIL has been on a rampage against us for ""destroying her life.""

I'm trying to be empathetic to Bob and SIL, but I don't agree. First, we legitimately forgot about it. Neither of us take medication regularly, and we had a newborn to deal with, so we weren't thinking about a bottle of pills in the corner of the medicine cabinet. Second, Bob didn't know the pills were unused. We don't know him and he doesn't know us. For all he knew, my wife could have a chronic condition and need those pills. It's not like he would recognize the prescribing doctor's name is an obstetrician. Am I not allowed to have medicine in my own house on the off chance that a recovering addict will come by and see it? 

I think Bob is firmly the asshole here and my wife and I don't have any responsibility. If we had known he was an addict and still left the pills out, then maybe, but we didn't know.

But, I don't have any experience with addiction or even taking narcotic pain meds, so maybe I am the asshole for not being more diligent about getting rid of the pills. 

AITA?

EDIT: Thanks all. 

I'm glad my initial reaction wasn't off base. For those asking how anyone could blame us, scroll down to the ESH verdicts because a few posters have nailed the exact things some of the family is saying. Not so much that it's our fault Bob stole the pills, but that we are ""part of the problem"" that has allowed the opioid crises by not securing or disposing of the pills.",False,1578513151.0,2020-01-08 16:10:44
AITA for throwing away containers?,17599,Not the A-hole,1867,f5tn9u,1582069353.0,"I meal prep my husbands breakfasts and lunches in those little black plastic, compartmented containers.

An ongoing argument is that he leaves the sealed containers at work (he's a mechanic in a shop) for several days, bringing home a stack of 10 hot, sealed, dirty containers that he piles on the counter or in the sink. I have asked him to bring them home every day, he forgets. I ask him to rinse them out at work. He forgets/cant/wont. I ask him to please take the lids off so the reek doesnt just keep getting worse. He cracks the lids open kinda on a few. Theres juice or bits of food baking in the heat from everything like eggs and sausage to ground beef to mashed potatoes. 

It's ""gag a maggot"" level when you open them, to the point theres pressure building in the containers so you get whooooshed in the face with hot garbage air. 

I told him to wash his own. That's how i wound up with 50+ containers taking up every inch of my kitchen because ""i dont have time to do dishes every day. If i have to wash dishes you just have to wait until saturday."" 

So i told him, ""Fine. I cook 100% of the meals in those containers. I make the list to buy the food and i deal with the shopping. Im the only one washing them. So if you cant use any of the options i gave you to keep them from rotting in a hot shop, im throwing them in the trash every time i find a sealed one."" 

He evidently didnt believe me because last night when he took out the trash, most of the bag was full of containers, some with utensils still in them. He freaked out and said we cant afford to replace all of it and i told him to remember thats what we tell our three year old about not scratching his movies because he wont have movies if he ruins them. 

And the three year old learned. 

So hes pissed that i threw away the containers and he is eating steak and mashed potatoes with one of the toddlers mini forks out of a ziplock bag today.

AITA for /how/ I told someone I would not give up my handicap spot?,17572,Not the A-hole,2306,dld32s,1571749815.0,"This is a throwaway account.

&#x200B;

For background, I (22F) am very petite, fit, and just by looking at me one would not guess I have a physical disability. 2 weeks ago, I had surgery with incisions on my spine and one butt cheek making walking more difficult temporarily. Though, I have a handicap placard not just because I had surgery, but for the overall problem that me to be unable to walk long distances.

I’m not asking AITA for refusing to give up my spot, but because of what I said. My brother thinks I went too far, but I think I afforded the woman the same amount of respect she gave me.

&#x200B;

I was going out to dinner with my brother (passenger seat.) I pulled into one of 4 handicap spots in front of a restaurant and the woman (late 60s) in the car to my right immediately opened her door to block my brother from getting out. We waited a few seconds, and it became clear this was intentional. I got out of the car and asked her if she would close her door.

&#x200B;

The woman immediately started berating me, saying I had no right to use the handicap spot as other people “that actually need it” would be unable to park. Apparently, I am young and skinny enough to suck it up (though she doesn’t know what my disability is) and deal with parking far away. She called me an entitled brat and accused me of “scamming the government to support \[my\] lazy ass,” among other things. I told her a doctor saw fit I get a handicap placard, and when she said I look “fine” I told her that my medical history is none of her business. She continued to insult me, even calling me a lazy bitch at one point, and refused to close her door.

&#x200B;

I eventually had enough and let her have it. I told her something along the lines of, maybe if you didn’t eat yourself into debilitating obesity others ‘that actually need it’ would be able to use your spot. She tried to respond by saying her weight was due to medical issues, to which I cut her off to say if she’s going to make assumptions about me I will do the same. I called her a miserable old bitter bitch and told her at her big old age she should have learned to mind her business. She threatened to call the police on me for reasons she was unable to verbalize and I told her to go ahead and pointed to the restaurant we were going to and told her to send them in.

&#x200B;

When my brother heard this he finally crawled out of the driver's side. He said something like calm down and let's go inside, and I said that sounds like a great idea if the nosy bitch will leave us alone, but she seems too fat to follow up with the police and bring them inside. Then we walked away with her still yelling things at me with her door open. She either didn’t call the police or they refused to come.

&#x200B;

I know what I said was harsh but I’m pretty tired of people making assumptions about my pain and telling me about my pain. Maybe I should regret it, but I don’t have an ounce of remorse for what I said. AITA?",False,False,2019-10-22 06:10:15

I will do an update when I speak to them, thank you again reddit x

____________________

I (28F) am marrying my fiancé (32M) in March.

I was in my parents home recently and I was telling them about our wedding party, which is going to include a male friend of mine as a groomsman. For some background. This male friend, we’ll call him Stephen, went to high school with me and is a post op trans man. My fiancé said he’d love to have Stephen as a groomsman, and i asked Stephen and he was delighted!

Then, I told my parents, and they were like “oh we didn’t realise she (yep, she) was going to be actually in the wedding. She’ll be in all the photographs, we don’t think that’s appropriate”  So I was obviously instantly mad.They then said that they weren’t going to be comfortable attending and being in all the photographs with her (yep, her again), and that I would need to remove Stephen from the wedding party if I wanted them to come to the wedding. 

So I basically told them that if they weren’t comfortable they didn’t have to come. I left, came home and immediately transferred them the money for the wedding dress. I then get a phone call from my mother telling me that they will pay for the whole wedding if I remove Stephen. Basically bribing us. I just told her I needed space and I hung up.

That was 3 days ago and I haven’t spoken to them. I’m shocked because they have never spoken ill of Stephen before,! I’m upset that they would show so little respect to someone who is so important to me. I am also upset that they have so little respect for me that they think I would turn my back on a lifelong friend for money.

I don’t know if I should speak to them in a few days when everything has calmed down, or if I should leave it to them. A few people I’ve spoken to have said I’m being a bit of an asshole because they’re my parents, and they have a right to an opinion even if it’s something I don’t agree with. That I’ll regret them not being at my wedding and that realistically it will ruin our relationship. I’ve had aunts and uncles calling me saying that this will tear our family apart and I’m being selfish. A cousin texted me to say that I’m choosing friends over family and that she and her parents won’t be attending if my parents aren’t, and the same for other members of the family. So it’s basically blew up into this huge deal where a good portion of my family will likely not attend either! 

My view is that I don’t think it’s selfish to want to celebrate my day with everyone I love. I feel like the ball is in their court and they have the choice to come or allow their bigotry to stop them attending their only childs wedding! 

Also to be clear I am 100% not removing Stephen from my wedding or taking the money, I’m not considering either option (my fiancé is in full agreement). But I just want to know if I’m the asshole for so easily accepting that my parents (and by default a lot of my family) won’t be coming to my wedding?",True,1564341546.0,2019-07-28 12:39:42
"AITA for leaving a dental appointment and leaving a ""mean"" review on every site humanly possible after the way I was treated?",17474,Not the A-hole,2050,fa0apv,1582780106.0,"This is really hard for me to share. I have purging disorder. It's like bulimia but no binge. I'm 25 and started getting help which was hard because everyone associates throwing up with bulimia (or worse ""bulemia"" and ""bullemia"") and gets dismissive. 

I've been purge free for the first time since I was 10. I hadn't been to a dentist since I was 12. Well obviously, my teeth are fucked. Now when I made the appointment I was clear that it's been a long time since I'd been to a dentist and have an eating disorder, and asked if I could schedule with a kind dentist because it was already scary for me. They said of course, they understand.

When I had the appointment...that's not what happened. The person who started the cleaning and exam was very rough and as soon as she got into it she made this long deep sigh and said ""Let me guess, you're bulimic?""

I started to say ""No, I have purging disorder"" and she cut me off as soon as I said no and said something like ""Please don't lie to me. It's not going to help you or me. We're going to have to (bunch of stuff I don't remember/understand.""

I said ""No, you don't understand. I don't have bulimia, I have--"" she cut me off and said ""It doesn't matter. You have severe enamel erosion, several of your teeth have X and Y.""

I said ""IT'S PURGING DISORDER"" because I thought if I said ""no"" again she would catapult me. 

She said ""Okay, sure, ""purging disorder"""" with air quotes and rolled her eyes.

I'm not proud of it but I started to cry because it was already so anxiety-inducing for me. She got annoyed and took off her gloves, threw them away, and said she would be back when I calmed down. Instead of calming down, I just got my things and left without paying anything. I cried in my car but shook it off and ended up going home. 

When I got home I was still really upset and so I started writing reviews left and right about the situation. I think I left one on like 7 sites. About two weeks later, I got a call. It was someone from that dental practice who had matched my name with my appointment and was wanted to discuss my reviews and how I was obviously very upset, but was leaving those reviews really necessary.

I said yes, it was, to prevent anyone else from having the same humiliating experience. She argued with me that it wasn't going to change anything or fix my teeth. I lied and said that I had already seen another dentist who had managed to treat me with dignity and respect and hung up. On the sites you can reply to reviews, someone responded to me and tried to pretend they worked with me to figure it out.

I've talked about this in my therapy group and with friends. A bunch of people are telling me I'm wrong because 1-star reviews can really hurt small businesses and how it's not their fault they aren't trained better, but I shouldn't take it out on them.

"AItA for refusing my MIL's offer of ""free"" childcare?",17449,Not the A-hole,2209,ekc023,1578253315.0,"Throwaway due to the specificity of the details. 

My MIL has offered to provide childcare for my son, her grandson, for one year (from approx. 5 months of age until 17 months).  The stipulation is that my wife and I provide her with an apartment in which she will live for those 12 months.  I've offered our home up to her, but she refused and stated that she would like an apartment in order to have her own space.  

We live in a fairly particular part of Pennsylvania where the winters can be fairly severe and the summers equally so.  I just don't see the necessity of paying our mortgage and a monthly rent on someone else's apartment. When adding up the cost of the apartment, the probable utilities payments, and whatever outings she decides to take my son on, it seems very likely that this arrangement would be either close to or more expensive than the cost of a legitimate and licensed childcare business, of which we have several reputable options nearby.  

My wife and I disagree on the matter.  She wants to provide her mother with the apartment, I would like to again offer up our home before most likely ending up saying ""Thanks, but no thanks.""

"AITA for leaving my toddler with my 'childfree' sister for a few minutes, resulting in a trip to the emergency room?",17441,Asshole,3103,cszgu3,1566339006.0,"I (18f) have a 2 year old daughter who lives with me and her father (18m), but spends two daytimes a week with my mom so that I can run errands (such as going to the doctors, doing the food shopping, cleaning the house, etc) and because my mom loves to spend time with my daughter. 

My 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. My sister and I have never really got on, when I got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks I force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). So, when I went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, I was shocked to find my sister there alone. I asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. 

My sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why I think this happened. I huffed because I was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. My sister rolled her eyes. I asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch TV until mom came back. My sister said 'absolutely not, I hate children and I don't feel comfortable being alone with her'. 

Now, I completely understood this and I think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. I called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. My sister rolled her eyes and said 'Fine, I'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. I was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. I didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired.

So I left, and went for the bus. Literally five minutes later I get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the ER because she cracked her head open on the living room table. Apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head. 

I am absolutely raging at my sister. I don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. She argues that I 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which I feel I didn't. She says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but I feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.

She has a habit of leaving food out to spoil, so I assumed it was all good to eat, but she sent me a message to make sure that there's some of the chocolate left for her. Fuck, it was already gone, so I've just rushed to the shop to get a new one in expectance that I'm a dead man when she gets back. 

She once flipped out at me for eating her year old decorative pasta, so I'm not taking chances.

Toblerone is replaced - with even more than there was previously. Not sure if I should put it in the Swiss packaging or apologize and just tell her that I bought I new one. For now I'm keeping quiet, like a parent discovering the dead goldfish and doing the ol' switcheroo. I'm in the UK btw, so the recipe is exactly the same as the one's in Switzerland.

WIBTA if I cancelled the adoption of my stepdaughter?,17441,Not the A-hole,2691,cn1hmi,1565183152.0,"Using throwaway 


So as the title suggests, I'm currently in the process of adopting my stepdaughter.



Me and her mom have been married a year and the daughter was the product of a horribly abusive ex-husband. This abuser was still in their lives when we were dating and I used lawyers and the courts to slowly push him out where he has no control over their lives and he is starting to give up fighting the adoption because I'm set to win in a few months.



Now because of personal issues of our own, my wife has just told me that she wants to file for divorce, but that she wants to wait until after I adopt our kid.



When I told her that I was afraid of adopting our daughter because of the child support I'll have to pay and not being a family anymore (which is why I wanted to in the first place) she had a full panic attack and accused me of leaving her in her abuser's control.



For info, the daughter is 5 and calls me dad.



So reddit, WIBTA if I told my lawyer to stop the adoption process if I knew my wife was going to leave me after?


Edit: Wow this really blew up. To give answers to some repeated questions/comments:

Yes I know the ex-husband is abusive for a fact, no this is not about the money her panic attack was about the control her ex has, and I will not even entertain the idea of suing for full custody myself.


Edit 2: Went out for a few drinks because I needed them because of all of this. 


Wife had just been diagnosed with some mental struggles and her therapist urged her to allow the meds to take effect before she made a major life decision.


I was originally leaning towards adoption because I love that little girl and we get along almost better than her and her mom but after reading the almost 2400 comments at this point and roughly 200-300 pms I've decided to talk to a lawyer when I get home to make an informed decision.",True,1565201686.0,2019-08-07 06:05:52
AITA for asking my husbands sister to consider being a surrogate for us?,17421,Asshole,8147,dv9ogm,1573592543.0,"My husband and I have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. It took a long time to come to terms with but we've gradually got there. Our entire family is aware of the journey we've been on and how much it meant to us. With that in mind, my husband and I came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal.

Sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her own. Despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally. My husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question.

We invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. We told her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed, plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she carried it. We told her why it was important to us and how much it'd mean, and asked her to have an open mind about it.

Sarah exploded at us. She said we were both out of our minds for making such a request, extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. She actually left early. Right now she's refusing to take calls from us and even went as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she decides to initiate it herself. My husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say that we should have kept in mind Sarah's difficulties. My parents think she is behaving awfully. Most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much Sarah hates kids.

It's really weighing on my mind and I honestly never expected this kind of outcome. She literally blocked us on every platform she could. Are we really the ones behaving like an asshole?",True,False,2019-11-12 13:02:23
AITA for not contributing to my older brother's wedding?,17439,Not the A-hole,2598,he3lo1,1592898277.0,"UPDATE:  Let me start by saying that I truly appreciate everyone who took the time to comment amd message me. You guys are all.awesome.

So my stepmom wanted to talk to me and she and I had a chat yesterday. 
The first thing she said was that my brother wanted to get together and talk this out. Which we did today. More on that later....
My stepmom told me that she and my dad had seen FSIL act like a brat a few times towards my brother but never anything like that night at dinner. 

My dad told my brother that what happened was completely ridiculous and both he and her owed me major apologies. He also let my brother know that he now has apprehensions about my brother getting married to her. And he wanted my brother to really think about what he wanted.  And that if he decided to marry her anyway, he doesn't know how much of our family would attend. 

My Dad did apologize to me if I felt like he didn't defend me to her. He just said that he was so shocked about what went on that he couldn't react. My Dad and I are fine.

As for my brother... Its sort of uneventful. We met for lunch at my Dads house today. When I walked in, he tried to hug me but I wasn't having it.  He did apologize. Sincerely I believe. He told me that he knew about all the wedding stuff she had prepared but  not the ""expense sheet"" and that he had told her weeks ago what his parents were willing to pay for and that she could not ask me for money. 

When I started laughing,  he knew that she didn't listen to him and he was pissed but didn't want to cause a scene in front of everyone. He went on to say that when they left, he blew up on her and she told him that she couldn't believe that he was ok with his family being so selfish and it escalated from there with her packing a bag and going to a hotel because her parents said she couldn't go to their house.

I asked him where they stood now and he just shrugged. I asked if he still wanted to marry her but before he answered, I said that I didn't care. It was his life and he could do what he wanted but I (and my daughter whom he adores) would absolutely not be there. 
And if he did marry her that our relationship would change forever. I would never ask my Dad to choose between us and that I am perfectly capable of being civil to him at family events but that was it.

I did hug him when he left and told him that I hope this all has the outcome he can live with.

And I may actually be the asshole now, but I really don't care.  I'm ok with how it ended.  
I don't want an apology from her. She means nothing to me now.

I feel like this is over and I can let it go.

Thanks again for everyone's input.


A little backstory for setup. I was widowed a little over a year ago. My husband had a substantial life insurance policy as well as a successful business that I have recently sold. I have no financial issues. I can raise my daughter without worry.

My older brother proposed to his girlfriend back in January.  She's nice and seems to love my brother. We have had no issues in the past.

Covid hit, so we haven't done family get togethers or anything. Their wedding planning has been put on hold. Until recently. Our state has slowly started opening, no one has been sick, weather has been good, so my Dad and stepmom decided to have a family dinner on their outdoor patio to discuss my brothers wedding. With my FSILs parents in attendance so they could all get on the same page.

I tried to dip out because wedding planning isn't my thing (I eloped) but was told my presence was requested by FSIL. My step mom said she thought I was going to be asked to be a bridesmaid. (Which would have been a NO but that's beside the point).

Dinner was uneventful but afterwards my FSIL pulls out a 3 ring binder and starts handing out ""information packets"" about her wedding. 
When and where she wanted it, pictures of dresses she was considering, colors, ideas for catering, pictures of cakes, everything a well prepared bride could come up with.

My favorite page was the list of expenses. How much she expected everyone to contribute. Her Dad, her mom and stepdad, my dad and stepmom, my brothers Mom, and ME. I said ""You expect me to contribute? That's hilarious"" I was met with a stern gaze from my brother. ""Oh my God, you're serious. Yeah, that's not happening""

Cue the meltdown from the bride to be. Her Dad speaks up and tells her that she was already told that combined between both him and her Mom and Stepdad, she would be given $70,000 to do what she wanted. Just like they did for her sister. She started crying. My dad chimes in and says ""Yeah, between the 3 of us, we will pay for a nice rehearsal dinner for like 30 people and an open beer and wine bar at the reception. That's it."" She started screaming. Like holding her hands over her ears and screaming"" Why is everyone trying to ruin my life? ""

So I said ""This is where I leave"" She stands up and comes to me and gets in my face, telling me how it's all my fault.I have money so I should be willing to spend it on her because she's going to be ""family"".

I just laughed,looked at my brother and said ""Good luck with all that"" and walked out. My FSIL blew my phone up for 2 days, calling me names and telling me how awful I am. I haven't talked to my brother but my Dad said the wedding planning has been put on hold while she reevaluates whether she wants to marry into a selfish family.  LMAO

I know in my heart I'm NTA but a friend seems to think I should contribute just to keep the peace. Which I don't really care about at this point and my Dad and stepmom agree with me. My other siblings do too but are trying to stay 
out of it.

EDIT: Because people keep asking 
On top of the 70k her parents were willing to contribute, she wanted 50k from my Dad and Brother's Mom snd 30k from me. Yes, $150k for a wedding.
Also, I think she had originally asked her parents for $80,000

EDIT 2: This post blew up. I.didnt expect it to. I just wanted to show My friend thate ""keeping the peace"" was not a good idea. Thank you for all your replies. Even the one that called me a narcissist and said I should contribute. 

My stepmom says she has some things to telle either tomorrow or Wednesday, whenever we can catch up. So.if there is anything to update I DEFINITELY will.

EDIT 3: I turned notifications off. I honestly didn't expect this to blow up like it did.  I will update when I have something.
To the commenters saying I.probably could have been nicer when this happened, I can appreciate that. However I was taken by surprise and being nice was the furthest thing from my mind. I showed a great deal.of restraint because her parents were there and I had never met them before. If they hadn't been there would have been a lot of cursing. A LOT.

Also to the ones who messaged me and asked, my daughter was spending some time with my inlaws. She hadn't seen them much since lockdown began except over video chat. If she had been home, I probably wouldn't have gone at all.",False,1593037220.0,2020-06-23 00:44:37
"AITA for telling my daughter her ""child"" is not really my ""grandchild""?",17393,Asshole,1948,cefevs,1563410848.0,"My daughter (28) has gotten into DPS and fostering, she has had her own child biologically but now plans to foster and adopt children. She has been fostering this 8MO for a month now and it's been a week-by-week process with the judge and bio family while they ""sort out"" their lives/issues that causes them to lose custody. Although it appears they don't care, aren't showing up to court or meetings, failing exams, etc., so who knows where that will go. My daughter hopes to keep Foster Child. 

I am planning our first professional family photo in decades and am buying customized matching shirts; when I asked to confirm the size of Bio Child, she asked me about Foster Child. I told her I didn't think to include her because she's Foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. She said all grandchildren should be included. My thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. That would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet. 

She went off on me and hung up and I am sitting here feeling horrible. I did not mean I do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but I thought I had a clear thought process? 

AITA?

Edit: I do care about this child, I'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. I just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still.

Final edit: I accept judgment and I commented on the person's comment that made me realize why I am in the wrong. They were to the point and just made it a simple question and I understood. 

I feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. I did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). Maybe I should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, I apologize. 

Accusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. I am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - I'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react. 

My daughter and I called her case manager and the photo idea including FC has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting FC or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait.

Thanks to everyone who kindly explained to me why I was in the wrong.

she has also brought super expensive gifts for people specifically to upstage everyone, she will even make a point of mentioning how much it is in front of people. 

she called up to ask what we will be doing for Christmas as it's our turn, I mentioned that me and my wife want to have a potluck at our place. 
she then proceeded to explain to me how we shouldn't let some family members cook certain food because of some instances where they fucked up and ruined the dish (this is all completely false information that she is mentioning to try and start some more family drama)

I then decided to put my foot down and told my wife that I do not want her at our house starting drama on Christmas and that her phone call was the last straw.

WIBTA if I (f28) got steralised against my fiancé's wishes?,17327,Not the A-hole,3830,d0go5c,1567805309.0,"My fiance (31m) and I (28f) have two girls aged 4&2. Last year I had a stillborn baby daughter. I said I never wanted to be pregnant again. It hit me really hard and I've never known pain like it. 

Apparently, your super fertile after a loss and I ended up falling pregnant immediately after our loss and I'm currently 8 month pregnant with a boy. Something my fiance really wanted.

I hate being pregnant. Never enjoyed it. I hate even more how long I've been pregnant due to the back to back pregnancies. I'm miserable and I never want to be pregnant again.

In the unlikely event the baby I'm carrying now does also die I never want to be pregnant again. If the baby lives I never want to be pregnant again. I honestly can't explain how much I hate being pregnant. I love babies, children etc. Not pregnancy. My eldest two girls and this baby are all c sections which is tough. I gave up work to be a sahm but I'm looking forward to when this one starts school and I can get back to work.
I hate how sick, tired and achey I feel. I'm short tempered with my other children. I'm fat and saggy. I poop constantly. My mental healths taken a complete beating - I've been in counselling for nearly a year now and feeling better though. 

Anyway. My consultant offerered to cut my fallopian tubes during my next c section making me infertile. I said yes of course, just check with my fiance.
He is very against it. I don't feel comfortable doing something permanent that effects him too without his support but equilly ill never forgive him if I fall pregnant again. 

He says I'm making a decision based on anger that's I've essentially been pregnant for 14 months now.

WIBTA if I agreed to be steralised - taking away also his choice of having any more children - because that's what I want?

Also to add, we've discussed me using the coil but there's no birth control that's 100% effective.

Edit: this has gotten more attention than I thought it would. I haven't had the chance to read all replies yet as been doing kids baths dinner etc, still need to get them to bed so will read every reply later.
Just to answer a few questions that have come up so far. I wasn't sure how much info to add in my original post to not be rambly. 

Fiance had always said as one of 4 he loved the madness and would want 4. I always said 4 was too many but we said we'd see how we feel after 3. We had never anticipated a still born and that steralisiation would be an option.

This past year he's been my absolute rock. He also lost a baby, but he had to hold it together while I fell apart. He's a fantastic father. This isn't a walk away from our family matter.

He's a bit of a stereotypical man in that he doesn't do talking about feelings, this is how he's always been and I accept that. He has so many other fantastic qualities. An example would be when choosing the music for our daughters funeral. He simply refused to pick. It upset him too much. You could say this is an ass hole move, however while I sat inside crying he was outside on the tranmpoline with our other 2 young children making them shriek with laughter, protecting them as best as he could.

I know in a way this is above this sub, because he's not an asshole, but I didn't want relationship advice. I just wanted to know if I would be crossing a line by doing it without his full support.

If I say I'm getting it done, he won't stop me. But he will resent me. If I don't get it done, I will resent him. 

His main concern is that its extra surgery with extra risks. Second that I'm not my usual self (I'm not - I am a raging hormonal mess, with a dose of ptsd, anxiety and depression to boot thanks to our loss - however I have a fantastic counsellor and things have greatly improved). Third he says there's other forms of contraception that isn't permanent. Forth is my age. 

And I've had 2 c sections. 1 emergency, 1 planned. Our stillborn was delivered naturally as she was premature and small so not the same risks. I have my third c section booked for the end of the month. I need to give an answer on Wednesday if I want the tubal tie at the same time and we are still in disagreement, so one of us will be upset. I wanted to see if I was being an asshole for choosing my choice, of permanent steralisiation over his suggestion of the coil. 
So far it seems from comments that I'm not and I really appreciate all the replies. I will read them all xxx

Edit 2. Guys I was asking if I would be an asshole not if fiance is an asshole and I'm beginning to feel very protective over him with some of the comments. I'm not a baby factory in the same way he's not a sperm doner. We love each other and respect each other we just have a difference of opinion on a huge matter and we've ran out of time. Whilst I'm really pleased it seems everyone is agreeing with me he's a good guy too. Everything he does is for us. He's hardworking, loving and fun. He helps me with the kids after a day of manual work. He does baths and the park. He rubs my back, sends me off for baths when I ache. Let's me sleep in, or nap due to pregnancy tiredness.
Leaving us over this wouldn't of even entered his mind nor is it a concern of mine. We survived a stillbirth while raising 2 other young children, as a team, filling their life with joy despite the pain.

I eventually got sick of it and researched legal name changes and the procedures and decided to save up for a name change after asking my mum and dad (to which they answered yes).

Last week I told my parents that I'd saved up $300 from chores and my birthday money. I told them that it's more than enough for the name change with post, handling etc. and they told me how proud they were about me being able to handle money like that.

Beginning of this week, I gathered up almost all the ID that I needed and put it in a folder. I couldn't find the envelope with my money so I started asking my parents and they told me they hadn't seen it. I looked all around the house and couldn't find the money. The entire time, my parents just sat there watching me and didn't help look for it when I asked. In the end I just gave up and thought it would turn up some time or another.

This morning my parents took me aside and told me that they needed to tell me something. They said that we'd be going to a ski resort (EDIT: caravan park\*) in a few week's time, and that they'd used my money to pay for some of it because ""we all need to do our bit because we're a bit tight on money right now"". I was furious. I started shouting at them for taking my savings without telling me and using it for something that we didn't even need. They argued that I'm an ungrateful bitch for wanting to change my name that they'd chosen for their little girl and that I'd grown up with it and never complained until now. I left the room and took a walk, during which my parents proceeded to text all our relatives and friends about the incident.

I came back to find my phone blowing up with 200+ messages from my aunts and uncles telling me I should apologise for being so petty and thankless. I have no idea what to do and I haven't talked to my parents since then. So reddit, AITA?

Edit: Wow I didn't expect this to blow up but, today I asked my parents about cancelling the trip or at least paying me back and they told me they'd ""pay me back with gift cards"".

AITA for using the women’s bathroom to change my baby?,17310,Everyone Sucks,1159,f9cg7h,1582675522.0,"I was out to lunch with my 5 month old son and he needed to be changed. 

I went to the restroom but found the men’s didn’t have a changing table, so went to the women’s. 

I walked in and there were some hushed whispers from a couple women (wouldn’t have guessed it was about me if it weren’t for what happened next.) but everyone else just went about their business. 

I was sorting through the diaper bag getting everything I needed ready to go when a restaurant hostess approached me and said “oh sorry sir, the men’s is actually at the other end.” 

I explained there was no changing table there and she said “never the less, this is the women’s room, and your presence is making some of our patrons uncomfortable.” 

I was kind of flummoxed and said “I’m fully clothed, I’m not peeking under stalls, I just want to change my son and finish my meal.” 

The hostess began to get upset and said “I understand but how about your wife comes and changes him?” And I told her we were there alone. 

We were starting to attract attention in the restroom at this point and one of the women said “I’ve been there with four of my own. I can change him.” The hostess seemed to think that was a suitable compromise but I wasn’t comfortable leaving my baby alone with a stranger to change him. 

I said this and another woman, who I think is one of the ones who complained, said “Then go home and change him at home or lay your changing pad on a counter surface in the men’s bathroom.” A woman with her added “Cisgender men aren’t entitled to violate our space this way. You’re making people uncomfortable, you need to respect that.”

This was the first quiet meal out I’d had since he was born, so I just ignored her and started to change him. The hostess got the manager, a man, who called from the door that I needed to leave.

AITA for refusing to fund a friend’s lavish birthday party?,17288,Not the A-hole,2688,f8pj8i,1582570130.0,"I am aware the title screams NTA but believe it or not, people think I’m the AH in this situation and it’s divided my friend group with more people being against me than on my side.

Background: i (26F) come from a well off family. My grandma (76) before she retired had a high paying job in the fashion industry. She wasn’t a designer or anything or well known on a world scale but she was known within the fashion circles. My grandpa (77) before he retired worked behind the scenes in the art industry so the two of their incomes combined was in the millions. They could provide for my mom and my aunt with no worries but they didn’t grow up spoiled. My grandparents taught my mom and aunt the value of money and whilst the family was effectively rich, they didn’t buy anything designer or any extravagant purchases. The most my mom and aunt spent on anything was buying houses outright and setting up inheritances for me and my cousins.

When I was old enough, I received quite a lot of money as an inheritance from my grandparents, a few million to say the least. I put all that money into a savings fund for my future and the most I spent was buying a new car when I was 19 which is the car I’m still driving 7 years later. Then, my mom died suddenly when I was 21 and I’m an only child, so I inherited even more money, our house and so on. I do not buy fancy stuff or expensive stuff. I quite happily shop at stores where the general public go as I don’t need extravagant designer labels to be happy. I also don’t really talk about my finances as it’s nobody’s business.

About two months ago, I had a few friends over and by sheer “accident” (I use that lightly), two of them found one of my bank statements. It was upstairs in my bedroom so I no for a fact they were snooping. I was pissed at them and I had to reveal my finances when they saw how much money I had. They were annoyed I didn’t tell them and I said it’s none of their business.

Now, I have a problem. It’s one of their birthdays soon and they want a HUGE party. I said that was cool and then they dropped a bombshell saying I should pay for it as I’m loaded. I was greatly offended and said why would I pay for someone’s party. It’s caused a massive rift with people accusing me of being selfish and hoarding all this money which I’m probably never going to touch. I told them that that’s MY money and I’m saving it for my future and any future family I may have and I’ve been labelled an AH.

Update: someone mentioned maybe my friends suspected that’s why they were snooping. Maybe they had questions after I got a lot after my mom died. I never disclosed anything to them as it was private but it was hard to hide I had a whole house I owned suddenly. I also am able to work a lot less hours than them so maybe they’ve always wondered how ibe managed to survive on a “low income”

Update 2: I should add my grandparents are still alive. The inheritance I got from them was money they’d saved for me for when I was of age.

Update 3: to those saying I’m an AH for my views on marriage. I would NEVER get a joint bank account. I think it’s only fair you both hold onto your money, don’t share and the only time technical sharing should come up is if you’re both paying half of whatever. Also I don’t ever wanna get married to those who decides to berate me for my view on marriage and getting offended why I didn’t have a reason for not wanting to get married. I also don’t understand why people are getting so annoyed that I wouldn’t share my money with an SO. The simple reasoning for that is I do not want an SO or a life partnership. I’m content remaining single. I also would like a future family one day not that I need to mention that and will probably go the adoption or donor dad route.

Update 4: I also checked my bank accounts and changed my security up as a precaution so nothing was taken. As for the paper statements, I am one of the few people who does like to have paper copies of my accounts. And yes, I do plan on cutting these friends out. I just wanted some honest to god insight into this situation as it’s incredibly frustrating and on another level, I’m losing most of my friends I’ve known for years so it’s really upsetting me.

Update 5: it was also brought up why I never disclosed I was this well off to my close friends. Yes I could have told them and never mentioned exact figures but that info is deeply private. They never mentioned their situations and I never thought to ask as finances are nobody’s business but your own. I have no obligation to tell anyone how much money I have or how well off I am.",False,1582588653.0,2020-02-24 10:48:50

When I help a guy picked two cards for something that basically said “combined together these two can make good profits” and chose make a wish and grave robbing, my friend told me he was traumatized, I just told him he needed to go outside more. He didn’t talk to for the rest of the day.

Additional info: the group had permission from the teacher so long as they weren’t loud or forced people who were uncomfortable to play.

WIBTA if I tell my wife I want to separate our finances due to the fact that she has fallen for a scam twice in one year?,17271,No A-holes here,1817,f51csk,1581934062.0,"My wife and I have been married for 9 years, she's beautiful, funny, and a very caring and lovely person. The problem is that she has a very credulous nature while I am much more skeptical. Around six months ago my wife got a call from the MVA telling her that my new car wasn't ever registered, and that I would be arrested if she didn't pay the registration fees immediately. 

She went to the store and bought a bunch of prepaid giftcards and gave the numbers to the scammers over the phone. When she told me what happened I explained that this was a scam, the MVA would not have someone arrested for messed up paperwork, nor would they accept prepaid gift cards in payment. I contacted the bank and they said there was nothing they could do, the company issuing the cards said the money was already gone. Needless to say this was an expensive lesson, but I thought my wife at least wouldn't fall for something like that again.

Last week she fell for the IRS scam, she was contacted and told that we made an error on our 2018 taxes and that we owed the IRS $2500. They threatened jail time, taking our house, our cars, etc. My wife panicked and gave the scammers our joint account information. She called me after she did this and I immediately hung up and called our bank. They said we had a large transaction pending, but since it was the same day they could stop it. 

Quite simply, after going through this the first time I cannot believe that she fell for another scam, the first time was such a nightmare and so many emails and phone calls. She refused to deal with it so it was me who was calling our bank, calling the prepaid card company, sending emails back and forth trying to get our money back. She said she felt overwhelmed by the situation and didn't want to deal with it, and now I'm forced into this same situation again through her negligence. Would I be wrong to ask for separate finances at this point, I don't feel secure knowing my money is in her hands.",False,False,2020-02-17 02:07:42

Both of them have always been bookworms.  Very studious and cerebral, just like their Dad.  I also played sports all through school and I value the experience that brings.  I've always tried to push them to join sports, but neither one of my kids wanted to.  I tried to insist...maybe they would have fun?  We dont know til we try?  Even just to make them exercise and meet new friends.   My wife insisted I back off.  Fair enough.  

&#x200B;

Now my daughter is entering High School and wants to become a cheerleader.  She has never wanted to do anything even remotely close to cheerleading at any point in her life.  She actively made fun of cheerleaders 3 months ago.  But one of the popular girls moved in down the street last month and she has become a mainstay around my house.  She's convinced my daughter that she has to become a cheerleader in High School because she was ""a loser in middle school and you don't want that to happen in high school.""

I said no.  I dont appreciate that reasoning.  My wife explained that I dont ""know what its like to be a girl in high school"" and I say OK?  Hows that relevant?  I also dont appreciate cheerleading.  Its too dangerous.  Girls get severely injured doing that, and for what reason?  We don't have the insurance to cover it.  Lastly, I dont like the sexualization of the whole thing.  Those outfits are a bit skimpy, and we're talking about high school girls.  My wife says I'm focusing on the bad and not the good.

I have followed a strict vegan diet for 12 years now, it's something very important to me & Amy is not unaware of this. Her father and her have lived with me in my house now for 2 years and she has never had a right attitude. Always rude and snide, ordering her father around and trying to do the same to me, she even smokes weed in the room I let her sleep in despite me asking numerous times to do that outside of the house. Brings nonveg food over and hides it in her room (a strict rule I had for them moving in was no meat in the house), laughs in my face if I try to make her stop.

Recently Amy and a group of her friends got high & thought it would be funny to replace all the stocks cubes in the house with beef ones. Cooked a stew and after eating it she pulls out an empty beef stock pack & laughs in my face asking if I liked the taste of cows and she guesses I'm just a regular murder now and can chill out.

Waited for her to leave, removed her stuff & texted her that she was evicted from my house & could go stay at her friends instead. My boyfriend is very upset and his ex gf is hitting up my phone with insults over disrupting Amy's life and schedule.

AITA for 'outing' my ex as a father?,17168,Not the A-hole,1675,enspng,1578888943.0,"My ex, Josh, and I have a five year old son, Alex. We split when Alex was a year old, and we decided I'd have primary custody because he moved in with a bunch of roommates, but he asked to have Alex every other weekend.

Well, Josh paid child support, but he kept making excuses every weekend as to why he couldn't have Alex overnight (roommates having a party, his friend needed help moving, roommates having guests, his sister was in town, etc.) and after the first six months or so, I just stopped bugging him about it and he just stopped even making excuses. He didn't see Alex at all from ages 2-4.

Last year, his roommate situation changed, he distanced himself from his toxic friend group, and his parents were putting pressure on him, so Josh asked if he could have Alex for one weekend a month. After setting up some playdates to make sure Alex was comfortable with him (since he was basically a stranger at this point), we went ahead with that plan. And it's been great, Alex loves his dad and they have a great time together, and Josh expressed interest in having him over more weekends now. It's also been nice to have some 'time off' being a single mom. Great. Good news.

Except... I'm not a big social media person, but I checked Facebook in December and noticed that Josh has been posting a lot of pictures of Alex over the last year... and he never indicated that Alex was his son. He keeps calling him his 'friend' or 'his little buddy.' Someone even asked who Alex was and he said, ""He's my little bud!"" Something about this rubbed me the wrong way. I feel like I've been incredibly 'chill' about this process, maybe moreso than I should have, but the fact that he isn't even claiming Alex as his son is really shitty. I was worried he wasn't even telling his friends that this was his kid.

So, next time he posted Alex, I commented basically saying, 'I'm glad Alex is having a great time with his dad!' and proved my hypothesis; everyone was like, 'You have a kid???' 'This is your kid???' 'You never mentioned having a kid!'

Josh was furious at me, deleted the post when he saw it, and basically said it's his business to tell his friends and social circle about his life. My sister also said I was being petty, but she said I have an excuse because he's been so absent. Was it an asshole move to 'out' him like this?

EDIT: Just want to note a couple of things here. Our son was planned. He wasn't an 'oops' baby that Josh didn't want or didn't know was coming. I think people saying that he needs time to 'get used' to being a father should keep that in mind. 

Also, he and Alex have now been spending weekends together alone since last July, and had been hanging out with me present since April of last year, if the timeline wasn't clear. This isn't the first few weeks of their reacquaintance.

Background 9 years ago my cousin got married to his his highschool sweetheart after she graduated community college. They had been living together and my cousin did not go to college as he was supporting her through college. She is accepted into a  school in (no fault state) so off they move. They have a child which He takes care of and works nights to send his wife to school. In her final years she gets a job in her field under one of her professors.  Right after graduation she tells him that she wants a divorce she has been sleeping with her boss/professor for 2 years and now that she is no longer her teacher he is leaving his wife and they are getting married. ending their 7 year marriage. I was not informed of any of this to call her out at the time I was never actually told of the divorce just my parents told me to save the date for same cousins marriage then they told me what went down

So comes our story cousin was having a rough time of it after the divorce but eventually ran into his middle school crush they hit it off. They invite family to second wedding and put an engagement announcement on facebook. Bitch Ex wife sees the announcement and post, ""He is such a bad father He did not even ask his child if it was okay for him to get married again how will this affect her?""

so I responded in a PM ""Did you ask kidsname if it was okay with them if you cheated on daddy and  slept with your boss then divorce daddy? how do you think that will affect her?""

family is mad when she contacted them. am i the asshole?

Thanks everyone I tend to be impulsive and stand my ground (I have litiraly out suborned a mule) but second guess myself later especially when I am being told that I was in the wrong so repeatedly. my parents don't think i was wrong just should not have said anything. my grandmother also gets on to me but I don't blame her they keep reminding her of what i said and she has dementia and still thinks they are married when she is lucid enough to think.

My mom went batshit crazy when she found out, I honestly believe her mental health cracked and deteriorated from then and she divorced my dad and moved to the other side of the US. Essentially, I lost my mom to my dads idiocy, she is *not* the same woman as she used to be. 

My dad had always been in this girls life, but over the past 5 years I guess because he had no one to keep it a secret from he’s more or less a full time dad to her.

AITA for throwing away my husband's Xbox after he refused to look for our lost dog?,17133,Not the A-hole,2046,g64rsj,1587603364.0,"This is going to be a little long. Please try to bear with me and understand my situation. Thank you.

For starters, I am a nurse (35F) I have been extremely busy these past three months, even writing this post is a privilege and I am having to do this in bits and pieces. I also gave birth to my daughter 6 months ago. I have an eight year old son as well. When I am not working, I take care of my children. 

In January 2019, my son suddenly developed this strong desire to have a dog. He begged and begged for a puppy from my husband (35M). I protested against that because I had just found out that I was pregnant.

Jesus. My husband said that we should let our son have a puppy to teach him some responsibility and that he would have some practice to take care of his baby sibling. He had also promised that he would help our son take care of the dog. 
I was absolutely unconvinced but I had to give in eventually because my husband had already agreed and I didn't want to cause further fights. 

5 days ago, my son had accidentally left the back door of our house open and the dog ran away. These 5 days were also some of the busiest, most gruelling days of my work and I had to take up night shifts because a colleague had fallen sick. 

Our son first went to my husband for help, he refused to help him and said that it was his (my son's) responsibility to care for the and he has to do something about it himself. 

My husband has the privilege of working from home, he works at a law firm. He works for maybe 3-4 hours a day and plays Xbox the entire time and sometimes gets up to check up on our daughter. He literally has no added pressures. 

5 days ago, when our son told me in tears that ""dad won't look for Tippy"", I talked to my husband, who said that it would teach our son some responsibility to take care of things in the future, which I found very callous since a dog is a living, sentient being and not a ""thing"". He was playing Xbox when I was talking to him as well. He also said he won't look for the dog or anything. 

Yesterday, after coming home at night, the first thing I did was unplug the Xbox console and controller and throw it in the trash can.

This morning, before going to work, my husband threw a fit when he didn't find his Xbox in the living room. I told him that I'd thrown it away because he was so addicted to it that he couldn't even get up and help our distressed son. 

When I came back from work, he told me he had found his Xbox in the trash since the garbage truck hadn't arrived then. Now, he's being incredibly snarky, giving me the cold shoulder and he's angry because his controller isn't working. He also hasn't taken any measures to look for our dog and our mutual best friend called and said my reaction was incredibly childish. 

Now I am spending my free day calling every neighbour of ours, making internet posters and contacting animal shelters and Animal Control to see if Tippy had turned up anywhere and consoling my heartbroken son.

AITA?

Edit: My husband is a lawyer. A lawyer's job depends on how many clients he has. My husband currently has almost no clients due to obvious reasons (he told me this himself). So his workload is significantly less.

This is for all those people who're saying that I am downplaying his work.

**Update**: Tippy still hasn't been found yet. My shift has ended about 30 minutes ago and I'll go home and drive around in my neighborhood and surrounding areas to look for him. I have posted some pictures of Tippy on my profile, for those who requested. Husband is still sulking about his controller. I am at my wit's end.

Like shes the walking definition of an 80s housewife. You don't ever catch her doing anything ""impolite"", whether its burping or farting or shitting or any basic body function. Even weirder, when asked about it she completely denies she does any of these things. I've never managed to catch her, up until she had our daughter. 

She had an emergency c section, and had a rough time recovering from it. She wasn't able to get up and walk by herself so I had to help her to the toilet and since shes so weird about ""needing privacy to pee"", I'd just go to the other room and she'd call me when she was done. 

Well she had been in there for a while, and I'm like oh she totally has to be shitting. So I went in there and sure enough she was. I teased her and was like, ""See! I knew you shit too!"" She got real embarrassed and told me to shut up and leave her alone and started to cry so I left to let her finish, but teased her about afterwards. She was real emotional so I shut up about it for a while. Well now some time has passed and shes no longer an emotional mess, so I figured I could finally tease her again.

Every once in a while I'll casually bring it up, like we'll be talking about something and I'll be like ""still it wasn't as bad as that time you shit. Man that was awful, i could smell it from in here!"" She always gets mad and yells at me to shut up, which is hilarious. Well she broke down the other day and started yelling and sobbing when I brought it up saying that was a difficult time for her and shes still embarrased about it and she hates me making fun of her for it. I told her it's just funny because it's the only time I got to catch her doing it, and its harmless teasing and it's no big deal.

I will try to keep this short

My girlfriend recently asked to move in with me since her lease was running out and the landlord did not want to renew it and given she makes a little above minimum wage in my country finding a rental place is semi impossible for her(If you make minimum wage or on welfare government rental housing is available if not and you are between minimum wage and middle wage you are screwed.), so it was move back to her parents or move in with me. While I was reluctant given we have only been together for a year, I love her and let her move in. I inherited money from my uncle which I used to buy my own house.

It has been going really well, until yesterday when she asked me if her best friend could move in for a while. Now this best friend of hers is a mess to put it bluntly, she can hardly keep a job, drinks enough to pass out at least once a week, smokes weed inside, got kicked out of her place for not paying rent etc. So obviously my answer was no, she retorted by saying it would just be fir a few weeks, to which I said even if it was fir a day it would be a no, she got mad saying I did not care about her friend and I shrugged andagreed saying I indeed do not care about her friend, she us her friend not my friend.

Well this turned in to a huge fight where she tried to have me sleep on the couch, I told her I was not sleeping on the couch in my own home and if she wanted to sleep somewhere else, she is welcome too.

Today I went to work and she had the day off, our argument was unresolved but she was still asleep so I did not feel like waking her up and arguing. When I got home 9 hours later I see a load of suitcases in the hallway, confused I walk in to the living room and ammet with her, her best friend and her best friends boyfriend. Her best friend immediatly comes over to thank me for letting her move in and so does the boyfriend.

I take a moment, glare at them and tell them to grab their shit and get out, after some whining they comply. My girlfriend calls me a horrible person and that they have no where to go and I tell her to join them and after a lot of arguing she grabs her stuff and gets out too.

I have since gotten multiple messages from mutual friends calling me horrible for making my girlfriend and her friend homeless so I am doubting my decision, I have plenty of room after all. Judge me. Also yes, I dumped her, before anyone asks, I am just wondering whether I overreacted and such.

EDIT: I should have done this earlier but I got overwhelmed by the amount of responses. So to answer some frequently asked questions. 1: In my experience moving in together is something you usually do when both parties are on board a long way in to your relationship, this might be cultural or personal but I don't think it is really relevant, what I deem appropriate to do at which parts of my relationship is up to me, I am not telling you, you can not move in together at 2 months either you know. 2: She moved in roughly 3 weeks ago. 3: She bought groceries once, besides that she had not contributed, nor was there an agreement on rent as this was not intended to be permanent unless we decided that later on. 4: She is not homeless, her parents live 40 minutes from me, she has a car and she is welcome there.",False,1581424004.0,2020-02-10 16:16:29

After work, I like to come home, greet my boyfriend who's usually relaxing on the couch, and change into my gym clothes. While I'm changing in the living room, we usually talk about our day. Well today, I started telling him about an annoying co-worker while I was topless. Out of nowhere, he abruptly stops me and curtly says, ""don't talk to me when you're naked"". I was really taken aback by this. Embarrassed, I went into the bedroom to dress in peace.

Angrily, I came out and asked my boyfriend why he suddenly had a problem with me being naked. Before I get into his reasoning, I will admit that I am naked quite a bit. For instance, after I shower I like to do a naked Kermit style dance to dry off in front of him. Anyway, his discomfort is that seeing me naked all the time makes it less special when we have sex. He even mentioned that this issue came up in Seinfeld and that Jerry would side with him. I don't know about this, I feel like I have a right to be naked, but I don't want him to feel uncomfortable either.

Anyway, should I let my fur flag fly or AITA??

UPDATE: Before I dive in, you guys really came through with the solid advice! Thank you! Ok, so after this incident I decided to cool off and go to the gym. When I got home my boyfriend sheepishly greeted me. I coldly said ""hi"" and sat on the couch to play on my phone. While I'm sitting, he walks over to me and without saying a single word, begins to start stripping! He gets butt naked, picks up my free weights and starts doing lunges, squats, bicep curls, you name it! I watched him in silence until we both couldn't take it anymore and started laughing. He then apologized, saying he doesn't have a problem with my nudity, he just doesn't like to have prolonged conversations when I'm naked. I understand where he's coming from, so we agreed that any conversation longer than 5 minutes will require a shirt. Tough, but fair.

Thank you again for your helpful comments! They were really thoughtful and made me think deeper about how I was making him uncomfortable. In terms of saying that me being naked all the time makes sex less special, he said it was a dumb comment that he only said in anger. I accept this.

UPDATE: AITA for being upset that my siblings are getting my part of an inheritance but I’m not because I’m a recovering addict?,17040,UPDATE,1097,ddgpuu,1570267507.0,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c76v9p/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_siblings_are_getting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

My first post wasn’t hugely popular but I wanted to update anyways.

After what happened with my parents, I won’t lie, I relapsed. 

I had a weekend where I blacked out. I remember getting back to my apartment and all the drugs and booze I had bought was gone. And it was a Monday morning. It was a lot of stuff. 

I scared myself so much I ended up calling my parents saying that they were right and I remembered everyone’s advice on my last post and I apologized for how I treated them and that they were right in not giving me any of their money. 

I’m now three weeks sober and I took Reddit’s advice and made a compromise with my parents in regards to my inheritance.

If I remain at least 5 years sober and submit to a bi monthly drug test, they will reconsider my part of the money. I hope they do reconsider. 

I know I have a lot of work to do and I still have a lot of selfishness to overcome but I wanted to thank everyone for helping me try to realize that. 

Here’s to three weeks and more.",True,1570238902.0,2019-10-05 02:25:07
AITA for getting my husband kicked out of the delivery room?,17031,Not the A-hole,3022,eqlbl1,1579405791.0,"Hello everyone,

This is my first time using this platform, I'm sorry for any 'rules' broken or any mistakes made.

A friend of mine showed me this website recently, and since then I have been considering this post.

My husband and I (married for 3 years, together for 7) had our first child 3 weeks ago. She is perfect, and everything I could ever wish for, even if she is a handful. However, unfortunately, her birth was ... complicated.

I have always been a private person, and very terrified of pregnancy due to the (admittedly low, but to me nonetheless scary) risks associated. My husband knows this, and I specifically asked him, when we found out about this pregnancy, that he tried to help me lower my stress levels, since the pregnancy itself would already be causing me significant stress.

He succeeded at this during almost all of my pregnancy. He was always very calm, even when he had a bad work day and was upset. He put up with me when I cried over silly things like wanting one specific brand of food that was sold out, he made sure I was comfortable at home and rarely had to go out when I was too big to do so comfortably.

We agreed on from the start that he would be the only person in the delivery room with me. No parents, no family, no friends, just us and the medical staff.

However, on the day I was admitted to the hospital, his mother (who is usually a very, very nice lady, just has her moments) cried to him that it was unfair she would not witness the birth of this grandchild. (My husband has an older sister with two kids, and she was in the delivery room for both of them). My husband tried to get me to agree to having her in the delivery room. I said no, and figured that would be the end of it.

After a long, exhausting, painful labor, when my doctor announced my daughter was crowning, I saw the door open and my mother in law come in. No medical staff got up to stop her. My husband was next to me and I clung to his arm and told him to get her out. He tried to argue with me that she should be allowed to see the birth of her grandchild. I started panicking HARD, like I said, I am a private person and did not want my MIL staring into my lady bits while I was so vulnerable and exposed. I kept saying to my husband, ""take her outside, please, get her out of here, please, please"" but he would not budge.

A nurse finally noticed how much I was panicking and stressing and immediately shooed everyone expect me and the staff out of the room. This included my husband.

My daughter was born soon after, but because of the MIL situation, he did not get to witness the birth. He was very upset at me during the hospital stay, saying I didn't allow him to see his child be born. I feel awfully guilty because I did want my husband in there, but he should not have let his mother in. It's been almost 3 weeks since we have been back home, and he still acts coldly towards me sometimes.

AITA for telling my coworker that nobody would care if he died?,16983,Everyone Sucks,1329,fhdg4w,1584032711.0,"I work in an office about 100, and a team of about 30. I have a coworker, ""Mark"", who is about 55ish. I don't think he's a very nice person. He is always making snide comments about other coworkers, hates poor people and thinks that if you're poor it is purely because you're an idiot, makes derogatory jokes about women and anyone non-white. Lots of people try to keep their distance, and it seems he is generally disliked.

Management doesn't do anything no matter how many times coworkers complain about his behaviour (and they have), presumably because he works very long hours without asking for extra pay because as he admits he has ""nothing better to do"". He is single, no kids, and has said openly he doesn't really have friends, just work colleagues and some family. I would feel sorry for him if he wasn't nasty to people.

Another coworker, ""Sarah"" (about 30) lost her mom to cancer about 2 months ago. I'm not close to Sarah but everyone knows it was a really horrible ordeal, and she is sometimes visibly upset in the office.

When Sarah was visibly upset yesterday, Mark said ""Jesus she needs to get over it, everyone dies! She's bringing everyone down. She needs to be professional, it's pathetic""

It was said in a very harsh way. I don't think Mark intended Sarah to hear but she did, she got upset and left the office (only ended up being for about 20 minutes).

I was sick of Mark's terrible comments and said ""for god's sake you're such a DICK!! You're just bitter nobody will give a shit when *you* die!""

I walked away before he could respond. We've been angrily avoiding each other since.

I assume Sarah knows what I said because it's the ""office gossip"" right now but I don't know her opinion, though I know Mark is PISSED. 

Other coworkers are split. Some think Mark got what he deserved, others have said that what I said was one of the worst things anyone can ever say, especially as it is likely true because he's generally alone in life (by his own admission) and has nobody close to him.

AITA for refusing to get a tattoo of my stepdaughters name even though I have one of my sons name?,16964,Not the A-hole,1544,cd0w14,1563123114.0,"I have a tattoo of my sons name which I got when he turned 1. I’ve never had a tattoo after that. Met the love of my life 22 years ago, she had a 4 year old daughter, and I honestly truly love her like my own. 

Recently my wife’s best friend noticed my tattoo (it’s on my chest so usually covered up) and she asked my wife if I had a tattoo of my stepdaughters name. 

My wife said no, and her friend is convinced this is a huge sad imbalance and is unfair to my daughter etc. She told my wife this, and my wife agrees now and thinks that I should get a tattoo of my stepdaughters name to be fair. 

I don’t want to do it at all, and I keep saying no, but my wife thinks a ‘real dad’ would get tattoos of both. I got a bit upset at that comment and told her I was a real bloody dad. I asked my daughter and she said ‘I don’t want a tattoo of my name, but if you are getting a tattoo for me I want you to get a cat’ .... I love her very much but I’m not getting a freaking cat on me either. 

My wife is very sensitive about the fact that our daughter isn’t biologically mine, I absolutely 0% care as my stepfather raised me and he is the best dad in the fucking world. I love my daughter and she loves me.

Am I the asshole for refusing to get this tattoo?

EDIT: a user pointed out I should explain why I got my tattoo. I got his name because he was premature and they told us he had a high probability of dying, the fact he didn’t was a medical miracle. I was celebrating the first year of his birth because that was the biggest hurdle to get through. Never saw any need to get any tattoos after that.",False,1563113356.0,2019-07-14 09:51:54
AITA for hiding my finances from future MIL,19150,Not the A-hole,1060,hiw0ot,1593579078.0,"I recently got engaged to my boyfriend of 3 years. For background, he’s an oncologist, his parents divorced when he was 5, MIL never remarried or had more kids but FIL did and so Fiancé has a younger half-brother and a step mom. 

I have a BA and MBA from decent schools, but I quit my conventional office job to be a yoga teacher and eventually opened my own yoga studio.  MIL was not outwardly hostile towards me, more like polite but very cold. She told Fiancé it was because a yoga teacher wasn’t good enough for him. Why couldn’t he find a nice “lady doctor” or nurse at work, etc. Fiancé told me this because we don’t keep secrets but I never mentioned it to MIL, I just stopped trying so hard. She would periodically warn fiancé I was out for his money, because he’s a doctor, he needs someone “on the same level.” 

What MIL did not learn until after we were engaged is that, through my grandfather, I have a substantial trust fund. I have zero student loans, a paid off home, car, and own my studio with no debt. I keep this information private from most people because I don’t want to be judged for it. I didn’t tell fiancé until about 15 months into our relationship. 

When we got engaged she was telling fiancé he needs a pre-nup and that’s when he told her about my finances. She lost her mind. Told him he and I should not have withheld that information, we were disrespectful, deceitful, manipulative, etc. She then started trying to act like my best friend. I maintained a polite distance. 

She asked fiancé why and he told her that I knew he didn’t like me because a “yoga teacher isn’t good enough.” Y’all, she turned on the waterworks, tears, sobs, said he should not have told me and that he ruined her relationship with her future DIL. 

I think she’s full of it. His father and step-mom have been kind, accepting, warm and loving to me since the day we met. It didn’t matter that I’m just a yoga teacher. His mother insists I and my fiancé are cruel and deceitful. I think people like her are the reason I am right to hide my financial situation. Fiancé thinks we should apologize just to smooth things over and clean the slate. I have no interest in doing so. AITA?

Edit: For those asking - My Fiancé would defend me when she insulted me. She did know I owned the studio but assumed that I financed with loans. He did not have my explicit permission to share my finances with her but was so sick of her harping about a pre-nup he “wanted to shut her up.” As for all the advice about the pre-nup - that was always the plan, which my fiancé is obviously fine with. She’s probably going to lose her mind. I’ve poked around on JNMIL and I think my fiancé is what is people refer to as a “surrogate spouse” to his mother. Another incident comes to mind where she started crying when he wanted to spend his birthday dinner on the day of his birthday with me instead of her and offered her the day before or after. That’s clearly not healthy.",False,1593578391.0,2020-06-30 21:51:18
AITA for confronting my kids private school teacher about blue blood?,16915,Not the A-hole,2106,dctbdv,1570149073.0,"So this happened about a year ago but I'm curious. My wife said I drug it out too far and was an asshole. 

So my kid comes homes from school telling me he learned something new at school, and he was excited. So I was excited too and asked him what. He said ""we learned our blood is blue today!"". 

I felt a little bad but said to him ""you know I was told that as a kid too, but I've learned that's actually not true."". I said I can show him evidence from the internet when we get home. We get home and I show him and he believes me. 

The next day he goes to school and tells his friends and even the teacher that that was incorrect. His teacher tells him no, I am the one who is wrong not him. My kid even said he believes his teacher. So I show my son more proof that I am right, but he is still skeptical.  

The next day I compose a nice email, not rude. Simply stating I told my son we didn't have blue blood and he told me that you told him I am incorrect. I give him some links showing we don't have blue blood.  

He emails me back saying I am still incorrect. At this point my wife asks me to drop it. I am upset and I don't want to drop it. As of now my own kid does not believe me, even after showing him proof. 

So I email the teacher again and ask him if he can provide me evidence that he is correct because I cannot produce anything showing he is correct. He finally relents and says I must be right. 

But at this point, I now need him to tell my son he was incorrect so my son will believe me.  My wife asked me to please stop but I didn't. I emailed him asking him to please tell my son and the classroom that he was incorrect so they don't go through life with incorrect information. 

He did tell the kids he was wrong and that's the end of that. 

Now I feel that I have taught my son a few good lessons.  A) it's ok to question things including those authorities B) it's ok to stand behind what your beliefs are especially with evidence C) it's ok to be wrong(the teacher) we can all be wrong, but when presented with proof, it's ok to change your opinion based on evidence.

Was I an asshole for dragging it out?

Edit. To those calling me an asshole? What is the best way to handle this then? I'm serious, genuinely curious of the proper way to handle this?

Edit: well this blew up. I'll accept my nta. But these people telling me my reasons for doing this are self centered? Nope. Couldn't care less. But I wanted my kid to challenge authority, absolutely, and to stand by your convictions.

Final edit: showed the wife this. She said that I was correct in following through. But I was the asshole because she had to listen to me complain about this guy at home for days.

I have been learning English since I was young because my father is originally from the US, so I don’t have to deal a language barrier Besides slang terms. 

Where I live there are a lot of immigrants coming from Asia, the Middle East, South America and other parts of North America, so my school has a program to help foreign students adjust and adapt to live and school here. Because I come from Germany, I must be apart of this program despite being fluent in English. Therefore I have a counsellor who checks in on me. 

My name is Dana. In Germany this bake is Pronounced Basically like the name Donna and not day-na. 
Some of my classmates and teachers refuse to pronounce my name the way I pronounce it even after months of asking and reminding them. So now I don’t respond when people say day-na. 

However now I have been flagged because of this. A teacher anonymously sited in the System my counsellor used that I am being rude, difficult to work with and not trying as hard as I should to intergrate and assimilate with school and social culture. 

I know that this is because I won’t let people. pronounce my name the “wrong” way. While I am reserved, I do have friends, do well in school and (when able to) involve myself in social activities in and outside of school.

I've been having major cabin fever recently, working from home and generally being stuck at home, especially when the weather has been warming up. 

Getting outside helps a lot but I've mainly stayed in my own yard. I have a hammock up between two trees and I've slept in there at night under the stars. It's nice, it's peaceful, and it makes me feel a lot less like a rat in a cage nowadays. 

I know it's weird but I enjoy it. It is peaceful and helps me destress after work.

But my neighbors are bothered by it, they said it is weird, they don't want someone sleeping outdoors near where their kids play. They don't like me being out there so much because their family has less privacy, and it would be better if I stayed in the house at night.

I'm not talking about a pixie cut that requires a lot of styling and time. My sides are buzzed fairly short with the top a bit longer. It usually only takes about 10- 15 minutes for me to get a haircut. During that time every salon I've gone to has charged me for a full price women's cut. This has always annoyed me and I don't enjoy paying almost double what men with the exact same haircut as me pay.

Recently I moved and yesterday I went to a new shop for my monthly trim and I decided to try something new. I asked if I could be charged the $22 for a men's cut rather than $40 for a woman's cut. The woman at the counter looked like I slapped her. She called a manager and the stylist over and they seemed shocked by the suggestion. They talked about it among themselves and then told me it wasn't possible. I pushed back and explained my reasoning and all they would say was they don't charge by style. 12 years of frustration boiled over and I ended up leaving. I was never rude or mean, but I still feel bad that I wasted a stylist's appointment.

AITA for making a baby cry to save $100?,16854,Asshole,2441,cc5orf,1562931668.0,"Okay hear me out.

So today I took my baby over to my parents’ house for dinner, without my wife. We have a five month old, she’s home with the kid all day while I’m at work and needed a break—so I went with the baby. Works out well for everyone because she can nap, my parents get to spend time with their granddaughter, and I bring her home a doggie bag with dinner.

On the way home, around 10pm, I made a left in a no left. It saves me about 10 minutes because otherwise you have to go all the way around this huge park and then there are a bunch of one-way streets. It’s a no left there because in rush hour it gets clogged up, but this was late at night and the street was pretty quiet: turning left did not worsen traffic or put anyone in any danger.

Of course there is a cop lurking and waiting, and I get pulled over. Here in Ontario, ‘disobey a sign’ is a $100 fine and 2 demerits (guess how I know…).

Baby was sleeping in her car seat in the back. So just as the cop was about to leave her car to walk up to mine, I just for a second turned the radio on fairly loud and on a static channel. Baby woke up and starting screaming. When I rolled down the window, the cop heard a screaming baby and sent me on my way.

Baby was perfectly fine. I gave her the pacifier and as soon as the car started moving she fell back asleep. We’re home now and she’s asleep and perfectly fine in her crib. I felt kind of guilty about the whole situation so I moved $100 (what I would have paid for the ticket) into the kid’s RESP (university fund).

‘My wife was absolutely furious when she found out’ is what I might say if I was a complete idiot and had told her.

They could hardly wait for Christmas day and begged us to let them open some presents early. So we allowed them to open one present that was gifted to both of them. It was the heaviest package under the tree and you could feel their excitement when I told them they could open it on Christmas eve. They tore into it like a couple savages. I'd wrapped it very well to make it take a little time to get at the goods. 

As the final paper was ripped off the present, the oldest was going like ""it's a..it's a"" and the final paper came off, ""brick"". I thought it was hilarious.

AITA for saying no to major chores while wife enjoys holiday overseas?,16749,Not the A-hole,1440,ee4kl0,1577047933.0,"Sorry for the formatting, my first ever post and its from my cellphone.  

So a couple of months ago it was announced after 20 years with same company I would be made redundant. This was meant to be a good thing as i could spend the summer holidays with our daughter (5) who had started school for 2 weeks then hit the summer holidays.  I've never had a chance to have time off with her before. Instead my wife announces we are going to China (where she grew up and her parents still live).  She knows I do not enjoy visiting,  especially mid winter.  She talked me in to it by saying we would travel, which I am keen to do, great wall and terracotta warriors specifically mentioned.  Once the trip was booked she says.. ""oh we wont be able to see those things the weather makes travel hard, but we will do day trips out to other cities"".  Even that I could handle, but the day we arrive she days we wont be doing that either.  What happened was just as I feared (and as usual) I'm left to look after daughter in a small apartment in winter, while my wife relaxes in her old room, watching tv, making models and lego (her hobbies), being pampered by her parents and having lunches with her friends.  I had organised to return 5 days early to home, knowing I would want some time too.  It is now a few days until I leave and she has handede a list of chores to do like wash our house, move furniture, stuff she wants done, and will take most of my time. I said no, she will have had a months holiday doing everything she loves, while my few days are filled by tasks she wants...  I also pointed out she had denied me a month of summer holidays with our daughter (yes ive had lots of time in China with her, but stuck in a small apartment vs parks and playgrounds back home is not even close to the same).  I am now getting the cold shoulder and feel so isolated in a strange boring place.  Am I the asshole for wanting a few days to myself after the last couple of months I've had?

Update:
Hey all thanks for the comments so far.  Just to clarify, I agreed to the holiday believing we would travel out of town.  This is not usual behaviour from my wife, hence I am so caught out, and am unable to travel myself as I can speak very little Chinese. I also have a new job lined up in the new year.

Further update:
Hey all thanks for your comments and feedback.  To clarify, we are staying with my in-laws.  We visit China regularly, and they visit us each Chinese New year, and of course have taken the little one out the the malls and local area.  Major learning for me on description in my posts.  Also we live in the southern hemisphere, hence summer holidays atm.

That said I take on what people say about putting my foot down and could have owned the situation much better.
Have talked it out and agreed to tackle the chores together when everyone is back. Apparently the planned trips fell through and she just majorly downplayed it, falling back in to her comfort zone.  I'll take a more active role in planning our next trips here.

Another update:
Thank you again for the feedback, for those who think this is a bogus post, have added a pic link taken out the window this morning (not that it proves too much, but hey). We are in Shanghai, so not isolated but have done this area to death.  Making the most of what I have (I should have made that clearer) but it is limited, was just annoyed to then be asked to give up my own small amount of time after how things ended up here. As I say above, have now talked it through.

Ok Google drive was folly, open to an easier way to share in future....removed link, not that fussed if not believed.

Last post here.. again thank you it's been great reading the comments and I'm trying to take them all on.  Have a great Xmas all.",False,1577064658.0,2019-12-22 12:52:13
WIBTA for suing my brother because he sold his house?,16741,Not the A-hole,1116,fqidxf,1585423457.0,"Context: My brother and I are twins and had wealthy parents. We have some property that they bought for us for our 18th birthday.

Fast forward 14 years and we are both married. Our parents passed away and we finished dividing inheritance . My husband and I are fairly high earners in our own right, while my brother and his wife live off of his inheritance. Our parents wealth mainly came from stocks, bonds and their jobs so they didn't have much real estate.

Two years ago, my brother asked my husband and I for a loan so he could start his own business. I agreed to it and we sign a contract where he uses the real estate our father bought for him as collateral.  At this time, he had been living with his wife in a different city.

His business was lagging, but he still somehow managed to pay the bills. He was still making the monthly loan repayments to me, so I kept quiet.

Recently, I found out that he sold the property he gave me as collateral to one of our cousins. Neither of them said anything to me and he kept the money for himself and did not say a word about selling the property. Now I'm threatening legal action against him.

I'm getting calls from my SIL and my brothers MIL daily. At first they were begging me to forgive him and that he didn't know he wasn't allowed to sell it. Now they're calling me a heartless bitch for threatening to file a lawsuit and it wasn't his fault because I got an equal share as him from our inheritance even though I made more money.

Apparently his business was struggling so much he needed the money from the sale to keep it afloat.

My entire family is in an uproar, half siding with me and the other half with my brother.

EDIT: I do have a recorded lien, which was drafted by a lawyer. In the contract, the property was clearly stated to be collateral. Something obviously went wrong since he was able to sell the property, which I am now trying to figure out. ",False,1585406533.0,2020-03-28 12:24:17
AITA for putting up a fence when my neighbors went away for the weekend?,16675,Not the A-hole,1825,erskit,1579629833.0,"I used to put up fences for a living. My wife and I (both women) recently bought my aunt and uncle's old home. The house has a large back garden with narrow paths along the sides of the house and this leads to a front garden that's about 1/3 of the size of the back, and is half grass and half paving stones. They have neighbors either side with the same set up.

The house is number 85. There is no fence between 85 and 83. 83 has 3 kids under 10 y/o. My back garden has a lot of space to run around, and as there is no fence and my cousins are similar ages to 83's kids, my aunt and uncle often let 83's kids come over and play with my cousins, and 83's kids have continued use the garden after my aunt and uncle left.

I have nothing against kids, nor does my wife, but we have plans for the back garden. These include putting up a shed, maybe a few flowers, and we're starting the adoption process soon so we want our kid to have space to play outside.

I went out and measured the property lines a couple weeks ago, and the husband of 83 came out and asked what I was doing. I explained about the fence, said I would pay for it, and put it up myself, told him about my former job doing exactly this, and asked when would be best for me to do it. He said not to do it at all. I asked why, he said they have a baby and I can't be bashing about with hammers and the like. I said I would try to keep it down but I would like to do this. He then asked why I needed to because things were fine as is. I said it's nothing personal, but I'm putting up a shed, and I just don't want his kids coming onto my property and getting hurt. He then said I can't put up the shed for the same reason as the fence, and I could see we weren't getting anywhere and went back inside.

Then Thursday night I'm coming home from work and I see the dad loading bags into their car. Saturday morning and the car is still gone, and has not been seen since Thursday. I figure they've gone away for the weekend and as the issue with me putting up the fence was the noise for the baby now would be the time to do it.

I bought the fence materials that day. I used wooden posts/panels and gravel to hold it in place. Whole thing was done by Sunday lunch. The fence posts are 1.8m and half of that is underground. These things aren't moving until the end of time. It's on my property and less than a meter tall so I didn't need permission from council or 83.

They got back Monday night and this morning I've woken up to knocking. The husband wants me to get rid of the fence. Says it's an eyesore and he's worried his kids will get injured on it. I tell him it's on my property and it's staying. He says he should have been consulted because it's surrounding his property and his wife hates it and thinks it's really ugly.

Legally I'm in the clear. Morally, am I the arsehole?

Info: it is a picket fence made of a pale wood. It looks clean and polished on both sides but my side is the one with visible building markers, eg there is a nail in my side of the fence. There is no such issue on his side and I am open to painting it.

Edit: In the nicest, most respectful way possible, I built fences as a routine part of my job nearly every day for the better part of 4 years, and have a qualification specifically in putting up various types of fences. Please stop asking me if the fence looks good or suggesting other ways I could have put the fence up. I know what I'm doing.",False,1579633362.0,2020-01-21 10:03:53
AITA for constantly bringing up the times my dad's new wife called me a slur?,16661,Not the A-hole,1084,gcvk9a,1588559437.0,"My dad remarried when I was in high school. His new wife, I'll call her Susan, always seemed to have a problem with me.

I overheard her fighting with my dad when I was a high schooler, referring to me as ""that fa**ot"" and stuff like that. This wasn't just once, it was a bunch of times.

I am a bisexual woman btw.

Anyway, I went to college and stayed well away from home and from Susan for most of two years. 

One time in freshman year my dad convinced me to come home for family Christmas. I told him I'd really like to hear Susan apologize for her language when I was home. He said she would. But after coming home, she didn't. She was honestly pretty cold to me.

At dinner my parents had placecards that Susan had made. Mine wasn't on there, and I felt like it might have been a deliberate thing? I was annoyed and said something that was honestly petty but felt good in the moment. I asked Susan ""Hey, where's my namecard? I don't even see one with ""Fa**ot"" on it, I know you thought that was my name for a while."" 

It caused a huge stir at dinner, like a lot of my cousins around my age and even some of the older relatives thought that word was messed up to say to anyone, let alone family.

Anyway I went back to campus early after that and didn't come back home for years. I'd stay on campus over the summer for summer classes and internships. 

But then, campus closed recently because of covid. I wanted to get a job so I could get an apartment. I actually got a job at a grocery store. And I was trying to find an apartment but it was hard in my budget. I was crashing at a friend's for the time being. 

Then I got a call from my dad saying he'd found out college was closed and he wanted me to come home. He promised stuff with Susan would be better, she'd changed. He wanted to make stuff right. He also really didn't want me working in a grocery store right now. 

So I agreed, I'd go home. 

And at first stuff was OK, but honestly Susan's been pretty obnoxious. She's kind of a control freak about the home, and it's stressful. She's also seemed to want to mother me in a weird way, chastising me for being out too late, for the study hours I choose etc...

I've started just referring to myself as Fa**ot since I can tell it makes her uncomfortable to be reminded of the way she's called me that. (Though apparently not uncomfortable enough to ever apologize?) 

And she finally blew up at me for being petty, for being profane, for bringing up something that happened years ago. 

I said that I didn't understand why she was bothered by that word so much, she chose to call me that first. I didn't do anything but use a name she'd given me, and never apologised for. And maybe things would be different if she apologized.

She still hasn't apologised...

WIBTA for telling a 'homophobe' that I've seen his Grindr account?,16657,Not the A-hole,948,dr2qap,1572827287.0,"For the sake of convenience, I'll call homophobe 'J'.

J and I used to be friends in school, until I came out as gay and he began to distance himself from me and spread rumors. He then started saying it was gross/wrong etc.

Years pass, and I'm scrolling through Grindr when I spot a faceless torso picture, unmistakably his due to a set of freckles on his chest, the username being his first initial, and the distance from me matching where he lives. His profile states that is hookup only, with no face pictures given.

I think to myself ""Oh, he came out, good for him."" Then I look at his FaceBook. He's still spouting homophobia, sharing LGBT stories with his own opinions etc, and harrassing LGBT people that he comes across online.

So, WIBTA to tell him if I found his profile and recognized him, many of the people he's insulted could easily find him as well?

"AITA for not telling my sister about my nephew's new ""boyfriend""?",16628,Not the A-hole,996,ciziiz,1564367814.0,"Last year I took in my nephew, who is now almost 17, after my sister and her husband kicked him out because of his sexuality. I'm a single parent of two kids of my own, 15 year old girl and 12 year old boy, and we live in another state so it was a big transition for everyone but I felt it was important. I should also note that I left the church of latter day saints (Mormon) 8 years ago and moved out of Utah. It's part of the reason I am divorced. 

Anyway, last night I took the kids out to a local carnival and my nephew ran into his ""boyfriend"" there. I put boyfriend in quotes because they aren't really dating. In my family they would refer to it as ""crushing on each other"" instead. The ""boyfriend"" joined our group and my nephew took a picture of him with my two kids and posted it on social media saying ""Nothing better than hanging out with the people I love."" I thought it was innocent enough. He never said they were dating and you can love your friends, but another one of my nieces saw it and reported it to my nephew's mom (my sister).

My sister is furious. She said that she should have been notified that he was dating. When I told her that they aren't even dating she said that she should have been told they were interested in each other. Here's the thing though. There is no expectation that kids need to tell their parents who they are crushing on and my sister never felt the need to know when she thought her son was straight. Now that she knows he's gay I don't think the rules should change to where she has to know if he has a crush on his friends. 

I also told her that she doesn't really have a say anymore. I have legal guardianship over my nephew. He's living in my home. She kicked him out. She started crying after I said this and told my family so I've been answering phone calls all morning hearing about how awful of a person I am for saying that to my sister. I don't see it but maybe I'm wrong. Should I have told her even though they aren't serious? Was it a low blow to say the things I said to her? Am I the asshole?

Edit: Thanks everyone. I feel like an asshole now for asking this question. It probably seems obvious to many people but this is all brand new to me. Walking away from the church and my ex husband was the hardest thing I ever had to do and I think I still carry a lot of guilt from that. My kids don't get to see a lot of my family or their dad's family because we aren't welcome for walking away. To have my whole family pissed at me again really hurt. I don't know anything about raising a 17 year old in general and am only now getting caught up on what it means to have a gay child so it's a learning process.

Edit2: I completely understand why people think this is a validation post and don't blame the mods if they have to delete this. I want to be super clear that wasn't what I intended to do. When you grow up in the environment I did it's hard to feel confident in any decision you make. Everything I did from the time I started talking to leaving my husband and the church has been questioned. Going against my family automatically makes me feel like I am messing up. When I picked a college they didn't want me to go to and refused to acknowledge or pay for, my first thought was that I messed up. When I divorced my husband and left Utah and my family stopped speaking to me, I thought I messed up. It has taken years to overcome what I have been taught and I am not a confident person. I let my 12 year old join the football team this year and can't stop questioning that. Every decision I make is harder for me than it is for most people.

AITA for not telling my wife I had a vasectomy?,16608,Asshole,2004,gmbije,1589868742.0,"I’ve been married to my wife for two years now and she’s always wanted to have a child  with me. She mentions it often. I’ve even been “trying” to have one with her. The problem is that I’ve had a vasectomy and she doesn’t know.

My ex wife came over and dropped off our 3 kids 9, 5 and 4. And she’s pregnant by her now husband. Well her and my wife were talking about her new baby and if she knew the gender. Now my ex knows that I’ve been fixed as I did so after our youngest was born. 

Well my wife says “I can’t wait to be pregnant, we’ve been trying to have a baby with no luck but it will happen when God allows it” my ex just smiled and she then looked at me and I knew what she was thinking with the look she gave me.

"AITA for asking a ""pregnant"" woman to get out of our forum for women who can't have children",16594,Not the A-hole,1587,fu9o8f,1585954028.0,"Throwaway.

I'm trying to keep this short: I'm (f/41) the mod of a forum for women who can't have children and have been so for the past 7 years.

On this forum there's a sub-group of around 20 women (all mid 30s to mid 50s) who have been on there for over 10+ years and we are very close. I consider all of them close personal friends, we've gone through very horrible times together, from first realizing we won't be able to have children, to accepting this, to dealing with friends/family etc. Three years ago one of our members died from MS and we've been even closer ever since.

So here's the deal: at the beginning of March one of our members, let's call her Mary (47) suddenly announced that she and her husband found a surrogate and that they were having a baby. Now mind you Mary has been one of the longest members of the forum and has told us in detail why a surrogate wouldn't work etc. so we were all beyond baffled. But of course, we were primarily very happy for her.

The problem new consists of the fact that I've been approached by several members telling me they are uncomfortable with Mary still being in the group because even though she tries not to, she constantly brings up the fact that she is about to be a mother while all of us are suffering from the fact that we never will be. Of course, this is the biggest event in Mary's life and I understand why she can't stop talking about it, it's completely understandable.

We are all friends and the group has evolved over the years but its main reason for existing is still the fact that none of us can have children and that is its main purpose, that is the main thing we talk about.

I've asked Mary to please not talk about it so much and while she seemed hurt, she promised she would tone it down. Well ... she hasn't. In the last week she's talked about the pregnancy, the surrogate, all the items they've bought, how excited her family is, how her mother cried when she told her etc.

All of it makes us incredibly upset. Yesterday I told her that either she stopped talking about it or I would have to ban her from the group and she got very angry and made a huge post in our group, accusing us all of not being happy for her, not being able to jump over own shadows etc.

I think she wants to keep us as friends but not have to deal with the reason why we became friends in the first place. I personally think she doesn't really have a place in our group anymore. The group is very divided over this and I've gotten more angry calls in the last 24 hours than I ever have in my entire life before that. However, there are also a whole group of women agreeing with me.

I'm trying to keep the peace but at this point it doesn't seem possible.

So, AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: For anyone that cares - I've not really been a part of the group anymore for the past several weeks because the stress has been too much and I have to deal with more important things. I made another woman in our group the new mod but from what she's told me, nothing much has changed in the group apart from the fact that Mary has toned down her baby-talk a lot. Apparently other women talked to her as well and she realized that what she did was really unfair to the rest of us. Personally I've not talked to Mary since the whole deal but I suspect we'll talk again sooner rather than later since I don't have much time left on this earth.",False,1587561228.0,2020-04-03 15:47:08

We're polar opposites. I've always worked hard and taken risks to succeed. My sister has always slacked off and never put any real effort in to succeed. She tried attending college but spent all her free time partying/smoking pot/sleeping around and ended up failing half her courses in her first year and dropped out. 

Recently she decided she wants to go back to university to become a nurse. She currently works as a cashier at a supermarket so it would be a big step up career wise. Problem is my parents have lost most of their savings due to some very poor choices and can't afford to support her while she studies and help pay her tuition.

On the other hand, I'm currently working as an actuary and have plenty of disposable income. Naturally, my parents think I should support her and pay her tuition while she studies. They say she'll continue working part time and will pay what she can, but I'm basically expected to support her and pay her tuition, or let her stay at my house so she doesn't have to pay rent.

I shut down the idea immediately. In my opinion, her current situation is entirely her own fault for not working hard when she was younger. My GF and I plan on getting married soon and I don't want to waste money on my sister's education.

AITA for letting my friend “publicly humiliate” my BIL in front of dozens? Husband thinks I should take some responsibility.,16554,Not the A-hole,1751,gd7mae,1588609178.0,"Obligatory throwaway and also this happened about a year ago. It’s resurfacing again because BIL has made it a point to ignore me since and my husband wants me to apologize once and for all. 

So some background: my BIL, 43, sees himself as an expert in all things and grew up with the kind of family that always praised him for being “brilliant” (he’s really not). 

Personally I’ve always disliked him because he’s arrogant and always calls me “over emotional” whenever I disagree with him on anything. Instead of owning up to his mistakes when he’s caught, he’ll also pretend like he never said it or you just misunderstood him or you’re too “irrational” for him to continue the convo. 

On our anniversary dinner last year, BIL was sat close to me and further down the table was one of my good friends who happened to be in town. 

Well he was spouting some major BS about stock markets this time. He had just gotten really into investing and none of us really knew what he was talking about. I couldn’t pinpoint why it was wrong but it all sounded pretty made up to me.

This is the part where I could’ve been TA. So my friend is actually a fairly famous financial strategist. She has been watching stock markets for over 2 decades. She’s constantly on TV and her face has been on the cover of industry magazines.

Anyways, I asked BIL to repeat what he said to my friend (she was too far away to hear organically). I definitely did channel that initial conversation and I did NOT introduce her as an expert. I won’t drone on but you can imagine what happened. My friend refuted a few of his points fairly nicely, corrected some of his glaring misconceptions, he then blew up, told her to stop misquoting him and read more, and she finally dropped the bomb of what she does for a living. He mumbled about everyone “overreacting” over things he supposedly never said (despite everyone hearing him say those things minutes earlier) then stayed quiet.

It was glorious to see but it was also pretty apparent BIL was beyond humiliated because he made a lame excuse about how his stomach hurts and left dinner not 15 min later.

It’s been a long time now but BIL avoids me like the plague and my husband wants us to resolve things. He thinks I should take the initiative to apologize because I was the one that started it by redirecting the convo to someone I knew would be an expert over BIL. AITA for what I did? I didn’t need to make that convo happen, but it just seemed so perfect at the time I couldn’t resist.

AITA for telling my husband I won't take my stepdaughter on holiday again?,16530,Not the A-hole,1663,d3d9gw,1568346349.0,"I have two children from a previous relationship. Danielle (11) and Elliot (7). My husband John loves them as his own, but also has a fifteen year old daughter, Alicia, from a previous relationship. We've been married four years, but I've only seen her a handful of times, firstly because she spends of her time with her mother, and also because she attends an elite boarding school for girls, so the opportunity to see her is very rare. 

Over the summer me and the kids went on holiday to Spain for three weeks. John was supposed to come but he was snowed under with work commitments. However, when he told Alicia, she said she's always wanted to go there and she begged him to convince me to let her come, which I did, but her mum had to pay for her flight/place in the hotel. 

It all went well at first, but a problem started when it turned out Alicia didn't pack anywhere near three weeks worth of clothing, meaning that initially she had to borrow some of mine - which were oversized - and then when we went shopping, I couldn't afford anywhere near the sort of clothing she likes, and she cried at having to make do with ''cheap'' stuff. She then phoned up her mum crying saying I was being unfair to her for making her wear clothes that she wasn't ''used to'' She also continuously tried to persuade me to buy her alcohol. 


We had another row when she met some boys from the same country as us in a restaurant/bar. She was cuddling with one of them, and when Elliot was tired and we needed to go home, she tried to stay with them and go back to where they were staying. As her guardian on the trip I was not prepared to allow her to go home with a group of boys we'd never met in a foreign country. She threw a huge tantrum at me about this when we got home, saying what's the point in coming on holiday if I won't let her have fun. 

Finally, Alicia was sulking throughout the journey home, and took to trying to antagonise Danielle, asking her if she's ready to have ''no friends'' once she starts secondary school, calling her ugly and things like that. I stopped this immediately and she sulked even more. 

When we got back I told John how difficult Alicia had been throughout the trip and said that I wouldn't take her on a trip with me again. He insisted that none of what she did was that bad, but I insisted on speaking to Alicia's mum on the phone and telling her everything her daughter had done. She defended her daughter completely and insisted that everything she did was ''what teenage girls do''. I was shocked, but after John and Leanne (his ex) spoke over the phone he has been defending her too, insisting that she's really nice if I get to know her and things like that. 

I've not said that I'll never be in the same room as her again, I've just said that I won't take someone that badly behaved on holiday with me again, but John says that I'm overreacting, and that I should give her another chance, which I have no intention of doing.

UPDATE: Thanks for all these responses they gave me a lot of food for thought. While I still stand by my decision and won't take Alicia on holiday unless John is there with me, a lot of people said that I haven't taken enough time to actually get to know my stepdaughter which to be honest is true, but as said above there are reasons for this. Even though she's a very smart kid (girls have to pass very difficult entry exams to go to that school even if their parents can afford it), I think there are better ways to bring out her potential than boarding school. It is of course Leanne's decision but it isn't something I'd have chosen for her or any of my kids. As some of the comments here have suggested it is entirely possible feels unloved and also unwelcome in our household, which isn't true at all, which is why I told John that I will make the effort to get to know Alicia properly, and actually suggested that we invite her here next time she's home from boarding, and hope to spend as much time with her as I can.",False,1568396787.0,2019-09-12 20:45:49

We met our neighbours(68M, 65F) the day we started moving furniture in. The woman demanded to know our landlords name so she could ""keep in contact with him"" & seemed genuinely offended when we told her we owned the house. She made a shitty comment about how she had to work all her life to buy her house, & we were ""too young"" to deserve a home

I'm waiting on an organ transplant, so work from home in the meantime. One morning I came home from a quick walk around the block with my dog & noticed their son's car parked across my driveway and blocking mine in. I knocked on the door and politely explained that I need to be able to leave at all times in case of a medical emergency, especially if I'm called in for a transplant. The woman snapped at me that she doesn't like people parking next to her because it makes her drive ""look messy"". Her son did move the car, but called me selfish & a snowflake as he did so. 

Once she hammered on my door and told me to ""shut (my) dog up because he's been barking all day"" even though he was at the vet and had been for a few days. About a month after that, I noticed my dog eating something in my garden. I went over to investigate, & saw he had a chocolate bar in his mouth & had eaten most of it. I found a few more empty wrappers scattered along the fence between my yard & the neighbours', immediately called the vet. I'm pretty sure it was my neighbour, but I don't have solid proof so I can't say anything.

More than once I've caught her trying to steal our post from the postman. I just don't get *why*.  A lot of it is just stuff I need for work (printer paper, sticky notes, etc) with no real monetary value, or medical stuff and non-prescription supplements that are pretty specific to my illness and no use to anyone else. There's literally nothing to be gained from taking it.

Her husband is racist and homophobic, and uses the P-word, N-word,& F-word all the time. He also really hates children. Last Halloween he threw a bucket of water over a group of trick-or-treaters. when the parents came over to complain they pretended they weren't home. 

We've been thinking about extending our kitchen just a little to make it a bit more accessible for me. Somehow in the process, we found our the neighbours' own extention was done illegally. They'd been denied planning permission, but they built it anyway. During the process, they'd also caused some aesthetic damage to our property.

I asked her why she didn't want to tell her she said, her mom has a big mouth and she didn't want other people to know especially her grandparents(my wife's parents are homophobic) so I just let it be and kept the secret as it wasn't my secret to tell.

He wasn’t pleasant to be around and could hold grudges longer than anyone I’ve ever met. But regardless of this, he was filthy rich. He owned a successful business that he sold for $1m dollars. He retired after selling, but his house sits on an island as well as the biggest piece of land on the island. So it sold for well over $3m. 

I was never close with my grandpa, but I took after his sister who is an RN and he adores her. He always told me that he was proud to see me follow in her footsteps. 

He died a few months ago. Since then, my family has been torn apart. He left everything to me. He essentially liquidated all of his assets and it ended up being close to 8 million dollars. I was shocked. I didn’t and still don’t know what to do with the money, but I’m going to save it. 

My dad and stepmom as well as my siblings are hounding me to split the money with them. I just can’t do it. 

My dad is an alcoholic who never said anything nice about his dad. Despite him being bitter, my grandpa actually bought my dad a $300,000 house. My dad would 100% drink away any money given to him. 

As far as my siblings, my brother has full financial support from my grandma as he is the favorite and he’s very wasteful and ungrateful. He never talks to me and always is very mean to me when he does. 

My little sister is the only person I’ve actually considered. She’s very young and that’s really the only thing stopping me. Her mom is money oriented and would take the money from her. So I’m waiting until she turns 18 and i offered to pay for her college. 

But now my family is telling me I’m unfair and the money doesn’t belong to me and I’m not deserving of it. That I’m too young and I’ll waste it on cars and clothes. 

I don’t agree and now they’re all threatening to cut me off and never speak to me, or even sue me if I don’t give them all a chunk of the money. I don’t know what to do and I’m buckling under pressure here. I’ve already had 2 police officers out to my house because my dad is claiming I stole the money from him. Everything was through an attorney, I know I did nothing wrong legally.. but morally? Idk. So AITA?",False,False,2020-06-17 07:04:56
WIBTA if i told my roommate that he absolutely should not be using Magnum condoms?,16460,Not the A-hole,1829,fkm7s2,1584548642.0,"Story time. About 3 weeks ago, my roommate had sex with a girl, and the aftermath was a nightmare. He got a text from her two(!!) full days afterwards saying she had just “peed out a condom”, and that it was super “sus” that he didn’t tell her that it came off during sex. My roommate claims that he was unaware that it came off, blaming it on his tipsy state at the time the sex occurred. 

My roommate is not lying. I’ve known him for many moons and truly believe the condom fell off unintentionally and that he was truly unaware. But that’s not even the point. 

When he told me what happened, I had no idea what kind of condoms he used. I don’t give a shit and it’s none of my business. Until yesterday.

Yesterday we went to the corner store together and he bought some condoms... Magnum condoms. 

Now, this guy is 5’8 and I’ve seen him in his undies one hundred times. He ain’t packin that kind of heat. 

I had an epiphany when he showed me the Magnums. I realized that the condom fell off because the fucking thing is way too big for him to be wearing. 

I asked him if that’s what he always uses, and he said yes and boasted a little bit. The boasting is why i’m typing this out.

Should I tell this insecure motherfucker that his cock is simply not big enough to warrant him using Magnum condoms? I looked it up, Magnums are meant for penises that are at least 8” x 2”. There is zero chance this guy is packing like that, and the condom falling off inside that girls vagina is solid  proof, and I don’t know how he didn’t realize it then.

Here’s the thing: he’s the kind of dude you hear about that loves to relish in his high school days as a Super Athlete™️. He’s pretty insecure and is *constantly* trying to get laid. I feel like telling him that his cock isn’t as big as he thinks it is would crush him, and maybe even make him resent me.

But like, that shit is dangerous. The dummy shoved a magnum condom so far up a girls vagina that she didn’t pee it out until 48 hours later.

WIBTA if I take over planning my funeral from my very religious parents?,16446,Not the A-hole,1100,eu903q,1580085621.0,"TLDR at the bottom;

Hello, all! Well, if it isn't obvious already from the title, I am dying. I don't feel the details are super relevant to the issue at hand, but for those who are curious about my ultimate demise, I have cystic fibrosis and after two rejected lung transplants, I've been told there isn't anything else they can do except keep me comfortable in my last few weeks. I've begun my preparations for my funeral and such and while I was thinking it would be a breath of fresh air in this whirlwind of death, I could not have been more wrong.

Now, on to the title! My parents are both STRICT Southern Baptists and want a very traditional funeral. This includes; hymns to be sung during the memorial, a casket and graveside service, a viewing, countless prayers during the memorial, scripture to be read, etc. My issue with this is...well, everything. I am the complete opposite of my parents; not religious, curse like a sailor, drink like the Irish, you name it. Everything they are wanting and attempting to plan is not me as a person. I've somehow made it to 25 and managed to meet the man of dreams and marry him last year and he is torn. He wants me to have it exactly as I want, he just doesn't want to have to deal with my parents after the fact while actively grieving. I have two siblings, one of which is a clone of my parents and one that is a mixture of my parents and myself. 

I want my service to be one full of laughter, funny stories and pictures, upbeat music, cats (my husband and I are avid cat lovers), I want confetti and shit! But, more importantly, I want to be cremated and put in a fucking cat-shaped urn. I told my husband I wanted my ashes to be handed out like party favors (so my family and friends can take me with them because I love to travel) and he looked horrified. 

My parents are absolutely NOT on board and are essentially planning everything how they want. Attempting to take me ""shopping"" for a casket, flowers, picking out hymns and verses, the whole deal. I'm obviously not very pleased. 

So, I guess my question would be, WIBTA if I took control of my own funeral and wrote a will to be followed exactly how I want it? I understand my parents are grieving and I've tried to compromise with a mixture of both my views and theirs, but, they aren't having it. I never thought dying would be so fucking stressful and I just want to enjoy what time I have left, without leaving a bomb of emotion and disappointment behind. Please, help.

TLDR: I am dying and my parents want to plan a funeral that ""isn't me"" as a person.

EDIT: I should clarify the ""ashes as party favors"" thing. I wanted my closest friends and family to go home with a vial or something of the sort of my ashes that way they could do with them as they please! Not everyone will get a piece of me, as strange as that sounds!

2nd EDIT: HOLY SHIT. I was not expecting this! THANK YOU. Seriously. I have read every comment and I wish I could reply to every single one, that is the goal! So, please, be patient with me. Thank you to everyone for the kind words and messages, it's been so overwhelming and if I were a cat, I would be making biscuits and purring until I keeled over. I am writing down everything that I want and will be approaching my parents in order to find a compromise. Yes, funerals are for the living and being able to remember that person for who they WERE. I am not all of the things my parents wanted me to be and I want them to understand this as they deal with my passing. I am willing to compromise, so, wish me luck! I will attempt to keep up with everything and as lame as this sounds, I'm off living my best life and trying to do something different everyday, so, I won't always have my phone.

He is a prof and I work in internationals. But our departments are very close to each other geographically.
We don't have the same surname and don't look very much alike. So it's not like people know we are family. Another thing is that my father is deaf on one ear and sometimes won't hear people when they are on his ""bad"" side or if he is running to the lab with his headphone on.

Okay now to the part where I might be TA. We had just had lunch and were comming back from the cafeteria and I met my coworker who was standing there with some other people. She waved me over and they were all snickering. I asked what was up and they began telling me things about my dad that made my blood boil. One of the girls (an intern who happens to be one of the students of my father) was ranting about how my father was an asshole who ignored her this morning ans basically accused him of being a sexist. Before I could interfere and lift the misunderstanding they began making jokes about him. About the way he talks, walks everything. They started ripping into his appereance and saying things like ""I am so sorry for his wife. His dick must bet tiny"". I was boiling at that point. So I just looked at them and told them (paraphrasing) "" please don't talk about my father that way. He didn't ignore you.... He is deaf in one ear and sometimes doesn't hear people. I hope you don't talk about other people this way. Grow up we are not in middle school anymore""

I did my best to not scream or anything but my voice was more stern than in other occasions. They stood frozen for a couple of seconds and instead of saying sorry they started to begg that I don't report them. This made me even more mad because they weren't sorry for what they did... They were just sorry they got caught.

Before that I wasn't really thinking to report them. I talked to my mother and she said to report their asses but my husband is saying that he is sure my father wouldn't want that and that he doesn't care what people think about him.

AITA For telling my adopted sister to go back to her true family?,16407,Asshole,2688,gcoc8s,1588530277.0,"Throwaway because my parents use reddit and know my reddit account.

I know how the title sounds, but if you are not willing to read the full post before commenting then don’t comment at all. Your perspective about this situation might change.

Being the only child in the family was awesome. I got to have my own room, friends, ipad, etc… which am now obligated to share with my so called sister (yes, even friends). They adopted her 1 year ago for a reason I till now fail to understand but I strongly believe it’s because I was not good enough for them. I’m really hurt because they NEVER EVER asked me if I want another sibling. I just had to accept the fact that I suddenly have a younger sister and should now share everything I have with her and treat her as part of the family. How am I supposed to do that? I can’t just start feeling close to her. And the fact that I am forced to involve her in all my plans infuriates me and makes me hate her even more.

Today my friends and I decided to challenge ourselves to stay awake all day by doing many different sort of things that will keep us from getting bored. Obviously since we share the same room my sister heard this and told me she would like to join the activity. I was honestly hoping I could finally do something without her but of course she had to ruin it. I told her no and she said she is going to tell my parents about it. I then got mad and told her to get the fuck out of my house and go back to her biological family (excuse my language), her voice then changed and she told me she doesn’t know where they are but I told her to shut the fuck up (Again excuse my language) and not get emotional with me because I really had it with her. She left the room and I started crying because of how stressed she makes me but realized I should whip my tears fast because my parents can’t see me like this. Otherwise, they will believe my adopted sisters words and I’ll get punished for it. She obviously told them but I denied what I said. I normally don’t lie so they believed my words and are now talking to her, obviously without being harsh and will still not punish her because god forbid they treat my adopted sister wrongly.

So why does he need to hang onto his precious fertility? It was just discourse, I don't expect him to do it but that answer has actually crushed me. It shows a lack of faith in our relationship and that he has an eye out for the long game.

He is honestly such an amazing kid and even though his mom and I don’t get along at all, I will say she did good in raising him. 

We have a plan to talk every other day on the phone along with some in person visits and if he feels up to it, I would like to invite him and his boyfriend out for dinner sometime.

AITA for getting my daughter lip injections?,16376,Asshole,3596,fgg4k4,1583885116.0,"I would like others to give me their opinion on this situation. A lot of people are angry with me but I think at the end of the day I did this to help my daughter. 

My daughter is seventeen years old. She turned seventeen in February. Since she was around ten, she has been complaining about her lips. She inherited her fathers thin lips. They are a great shape, but they are thin. She has been bullied for it for ages. She has come crying to me about it several times. I thought she would get over it as she got older, but she never has. 

My daughter lives with her father and step mother full time because I travel for work. But when I am in town, she tends to stay with me for weeks at a time. We are very close. Two weeks ago she confided in me that she had been saving money for lip injections for two years now. She had a lot of money saved up.

We had a heart to heart about it and I decided to go ahead and pay for her to get them from a good doctor. I signed the consent forms and we did it. She is very happy with them, she loves them. They have really balanced out her face. 

When it was time for me to leave for work again, I took her back to her father’s. He flipped it. He started yelling at both of us and claiming that we destroyed her face. I apologized to him for not clearing it with him, but it was because I knew that he would say no. This was something she has really wanted for a long time. He argues that she is a child and doesn’t know what she wants.

Of course he has spread the news of the lip injections to several family members. They think that it is shameful that I would take my daughter to get plastic surgery and are urging him to limit my visitation (probably not going to happen).

I never really wanted to be a mom, and don’t feel as though I connect with them very well. 

A few nights ago I was putting my eldest daughter to sleep when she started asking me loads of questions. She’s a really curious little girl. I had a traumatic birth with her and post natal depression so always struggled with bonding, and still do struggle connecting with her. She told me she wants lots of babies when she’s older and then asked me how many I wanted when I was her age. I told her I didn’t want any and that I didn’t even want any when I had her. I know she’s only 5 but she massively misinterpreted it and got upset. I comforted her and put her back to sleep. 

In the morning she must’ve told her father what had happened when he was making her breakfast as I woke up to my husband absolutely furious with me for traumatising our daughter and damaging her self esteem. I told him she’d be fine but he kept shouting at me telling me I was an awful mother. I replied that it’s hard being a good mother to kids you regret having.

We both contribute to rent equally, but basically all of the kitchenware is mine. I had it all before she moved in and we agreed before she moved in that we'd share them because she only gets so much money a month and it would be impossible to get her own kitchen stuff. It's no big deal to me, but at the time, her child was exclusively bottle fed.

Now her kid eats rice cereal or oat cereal. I don't know how many people here are parents or whatever but this is the most vile stuff to smell. She mixes this porridge like sludge half and half with formula. It begins to smell immediately and after an hour? I've thrown up before from the smell. But whatever, kids gotta eat.

My problem is my roommate doesn't wash these dishes. She'll make this oatmeal stuff, feed it to her kid, then leave half of it remaining in the bowl in the sink, oftentimes when I'm at work. After 2-3 hours, it turns into cement basically, and our dishwasher won't clean it. I always have to clean it because she's busy with her kid. Try as I might to get her to *just rinse it after use* so it can be put in the dishwasher, it falls on deaf ears. I even asked if she'd get tiny plastic bowls to make it and she said she can't afford it (a 5-pack is only like $5 and are dishwasher safe)...

After about a month of this, I've begun just throwing them out. Instead of cleaning them, I throw my dishes away. We have no bowls now, she can't prepare this stuff in a plate.

He would have to save up half the money for a large hutch and I would pay for a large outdoor run,  he agreed and did his chores and for his birthday I paid for 2 Guinea pigs from a local seller.


My son named the guinea pigs pudding and candy. 
Within days of buying them my son lost interest, he refused to feed them, refused to clean them and refused to move their run around the garden so they were on fresh grass.

I warned him multiple times that I would take possession of the pigs as my own, I discussed with my husband before we got them that I would quite enjoy having them in the garden as I had Guinea pigs growing up and always adored them.

So after a few months of doing 100% of the work myself I renamed the guinea pigs geralt and roach.


When my son was in the garden playing he heard me calling them to get them in the pen.
( I move them from the outdoor run and pen to the indoor shed pen at night) 
He threw an absolutely huge tantrum and demanded i change the names back.


I said if he began looking after them like he was supposed to that he could change the names back.


He continued to sulk and moan  but eventually agreed to these terms.


It's been a week since that tantrum and he hasn't been near them since, he sulks every day about the names but refuses to help.


my husband has told me to just change the names back and let it go, but I prefer those names and seeing as I'm doing all the work and I see them as my pets now not my sons why shouldn't I? 

I will gladly re think this situation if I am wrong or missing the point but I just don't think my husbands point Is very fair,  my son needs more discipline already as he seems to be so demanding and sulky lately AITA?",False,1588449978.0,2020-05-02 16:02:47
AITA using my son's college fund to remodel my home?,16313,Not the A-hole,3638,gftg9e,1588974116.0,"I have consistently put money away for my kids' college funds since they were young. Their education was important to me. I worked very hard to get my degree and eventually my Master's. I didn't want my kids to be burden or worried about funds when they went to school. My son got into a decent school and started off well. Then his grades slumped and he said he was dropping out. He's now 23 and has been bouncing from one odd job to the next.

He took some blue collar job and moved out with his girlfriend who is a waitress.. Long story short, they ended up getting married. Then they BOTH lost their jobs. I wasn't worried about it because they always seem to have money for sporting games, home decor, etc. My son told me that he and his wife were FLAT broke and severely in debt. True, they worked long hours but they still weren't making enough to support their lifestyle and it's important to them to do fun things together. That is the crux of their relationship because they are both very social and fun people. He also mentioned that their home needed repairs and both needed new cars.

My son asked me to let him tap in what remained of his college fund to help them get out of debt, fix their home and cars. There is about 45K left. I told him no. That money was for COLLEGE and not some newlywed slush fund. He had two years to go back to college and he decided he didn't want to. As I saw it, he forfeited that money and I want to use it to remodel my house. I bit my tongue when he got married, dropped out of school, took dead-end jobs, etc. but I am not bailing him out this time.

Edit: I couldn't care less what his wife does. Point is that she was making as much money as the person who started months before and she's been there three years. Dead. End. Job. And my son was a ""process engineer"" or whatever the fuck that is. His place got shut down too.

Edit 2: My son called me saying his wife's restaurant is closing permanently. She worked at the Soup Plantation.

Edit: My son and his wife likes having nice things. I felt like he was a bit spoiled but he disagrees. He wants all the things he couldn't have as a kid even though he can't afford it. He does not get that I can afford stuff and he can't.",False,1588965863.0,2020-05-08 14:41:56
AITA for refusing to dry my bras in my bedroom and telling my flatmate that she and her bf need to grow up?,16307,Not the A-hole,1839,gla3kq,1589722906.0,"Obligatory throwaway so men don’t message me about my tits on my regular account + I’m on mobile, so sorry if formatting is weird.

So, the other day one of my flatmates (with whom I have, up until this point, had neither a positive nor negative relationship with) sent me this long text that started with “we need to talk about the laundry situation.” This was a bit confusing, since I wasn’t aware of any particular laundry situation. The rest of the text was her telling me that I need to keep my bras out of the laundry room because apparently, when she had her boyfriend over, he went in there and saw my bras hanging up to dry on the drying rack, and was so shocked?intrigued?whatever that he checked the fucking tags (I have no idea if this is normal male behavior, but it creeped me out to read) to see the size, and then “wouldn’t stop talking about it.” 

I responded with, basically, “then tell your boyfriend to keep his hands off my shit and shut up.” Flatmate did not consider this an adequate response, and told me that I should keep my “pornstar bras” in my room because it’s apparently inappropriate to dry them in the laundry room. At this point I was quite annoyed; I don’t wear “pornstar bras,” I just have very large breasts, and they’re a literal constant source of annoyance and back pain. The bras in question were totally normal, but apparently them being a UK 34H makes them inappropriate. I told her that I’m not going to try to dry my bras in my room since it’s tiny and we have a perfectly good drying rack in the laundry room, which is for laundry, and that both she and her boyfriend needed to get over it and grow up. I know that this wasn’t terribly diplomatic, but I felt like she was much ruder than I was. I didn’t really think about it the next day, but now it’s been three days and she’s completely ignoring me, so I’m wondering if I misjudged the situation. AITA?

EDIT/UPDATE: 
1. thank you all for your feedback. I very much appreciate all of you who assured me that the boyfriend is creepy and that I wasn’t overreacting, because I was starting to feel like I was in some twilight zone where it’s just normal for random men to be examining my bras.

2. As many of you have pointed out, yes, we are supposed to be sheltering in place and her boyfriend should not be coming over anyway. This is part of why I wasn’t feeling very charitable from the start. I don’t want to get sick but she insists her boyfriend is “safe.”

3. Regardless, I decided to reach out to her again and be a bit nicer. Like many of the commenters, I was also pretty sure this was a jealousy issue, and even though she’s annoying, I know feeling bad about your body sucks. Since she clearly doesn’t want to talk to me, I texted her again and told her that I’m sorry that her boyfriend is making her feel bad about herself, and that I think it’s completely out of line for him to talk about my body, as it’s disrespectful to both of us. I reiterated that I’m going to continue drying my bras on the drying rack because it’s the most logical place to dry them, and that I need her to tell her boyfriend to not touch my things, but that if she’s open to it, I’d like for us to have a conversation about body image and guys, as I’ve dated men before who’ve made me feel weird about my body or who couldn’t keep their eyes and hands to themselves. She hasn’t responded yet, but hopefully she’ll ditch him.

4. Seems that there are many large-breasted women in these comments. If any of you aren’t already familiar, I highly recommend a) using the size calculator on r/abrathatfits and asking the extremely knowledgeable women there for help in finding bras that are comfortable and don’t break the bank, and b) abandoning American bras forever because they suck and have a tiny size range.",False,1589745381.0,2020-05-17 06:41:46
AITA for telling one of my bridesmaids to take her glasses off during photos?,16299,Asshole,535,dl0xoy,1571695063.0,"I am getting married in a few weeks and have my bridal party primed and ready, but had a huge disagreement with one of them yesterday. 

Her name is Tara, and she is stunning. She's legit the prettiest out of our entire group. Absolutely gorgeous. However, there is one issue. Tara has terrible vision. She needs very strong glasses and even with them on her eyesight is bad. She gets the lenses thinned down as much as possible and even then they are so thick you can't see her eyes behind them. Her eyes can't tolerate contacts.

In our ''bridal meeting'' yesterday, I asked if it was possible for Tara to take off her glasses during the main photos. I wasn't saying this to be cruel. I'd never ask her to take them off during the wedding party and walk around blind, but I'm just asking her to take them off during photos. Without those glasses she's absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, way more than me, but with them on her eyes look weird and distorted and would take all the attention away in the photos for all the wrong reasons.

I brought this up with her but she got really huffy and sulky, told me to try on her glasses so I could see what she would be seeing during the photos if she took them off. I did and it was horrible, but I could stomach it for a few minutes to help out a friend and think she's being really unreasonable. She left early and the rest of the bridal party got at me for asking something so ''horrible''. I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask. I'm doing her a favour.

AITA for not including my recently divorced exwife on a family trip?,16298,Not the A-hole,1836,hdpo6p,1592849606.0,"10 months ago my wife of 15 years explained to me she had interest in a coworker so I left it up to her to decide whether to open up our marriage. I figured it was just an exploratory phase. Something she would have a change of heart about. After 5 months of being miserable with her going off with him nearly every weekend I expressed to her I wanted to look for someone else. She replied that it would only push her to the other man. Nonetheless I started seeing someone and after the first day of me seeing someone else, my wife wanted a divorce.

We have officially been divorced for a week. We have 3 kids together. We are also living together for the time being while she and her boyfriend are closing on a house together. 

Recently our family friend's wife contacted me and invited me and the kids to join her family on a trip. I planned on taking my girlfriend along with us. I explained to the family friend that if my family were to go on the trip my kid's mother would not be going.They acknowledged and figured that was going to happen.

Realistically there is no room for 2 extra people. Personally I have no interest in going on a trip with her and the man she left me for. She said she was hurt that my girlfriend is going in her place and that she was ousted so soon. She suggested that it could just be me, her and the kids as per usual before our divorce. While our papers were signed a week ago, I am ready to settle into my new normal.

AITA for not including her?

EDIT: My oldest is 14 and has known about basically everything from the beginning.  My younger 2 are 9 and 10. Both had suspicion about their mother's relationship with the bf before finding out the gory details. Mine was a tidy secret until that point. Once the younger 2 learned the truth they made the decision as to when they met my gf. This has been 2 months today. The conflict for me falls to the other family having been ""our"" friends for 14 years. Also the desire for things to remain healthy as possible between my ex and myself for the sake of the kids.  My ex hopes to still do things like this together as ""family "" and in the future maybe we can but right now I don't think I could stomach it. I explained this to my ex and she seems to be heartbroken at the notion. She is crying and I just feel irritated.  Kinda makes me feel like an asshole.  This situation is centered around myself and my ex, the kids are actually doing pretty well.

EDIT 2: I spent 5 months doing everything I could think of to save us. She spent 5 months leaving me at home with the kids. Lie after lie and zero shits given about my feelings.  The exact moment I said F it was when she didn't want me to attend her office Christmas party as I have every year for over a decade.  Her reasoning was she didn't want her coworkers to think she was a whore. Sounds to me like she was pushing a narrative that I was no longer in the picture.  That was the moment I realized where I stood and that being faithful to her was a waste. My girlfriend walked into my life 3 days later. The hypocrisy and insanity that followed were truly unbelievable.  After her initial immediate demands for divorce  she decided that we should ""start"" working on our marriage.  Step 1 was ditch my girlfriend.  Mind you I had known her for a week and had no real ties to her. 
Nothing to say about how she would end her 5 month relationship with a man she works 40hrs a week with and that is centric to her friend group.  I may or may not be an asshole for excluding her from this trip but I'm not asking about the demise of the marriage.",False,1592834742.0,2020-06-22 11:13:26

The ceremony is halfway across the country and I've been saving for several months so our family of 5 can fly out for it. The venue is upscale and beautiful.

The ceremony will be a formal-ish event (she said it fits most closely with the [""cocktail"" definition here](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet)). 

Husband doesn't *dress up*. He wore a tux for his best friend's wedding when he was 20 and that's the last time he's worn a tie. He wore jeans and a casual sport coat for our wedding (That was fine with me - it was his wedding too and the ceremony was immediate family only).

When I broke the news about N's wedding, adding that we'd rent a suit instead of making an otherwise useless purchase, he said ""No. I'm not wearing a suit. I guess I'll be the only one there not in a suit.""

I told him that if he won't wear the appropriate attire then he can just stay home and everyone will know that he's a whiny butt baby who thinks his personal preference is more important than a special family event for someone he says he loves. I added ""Nice priorities there, honey.""

* My mom and brother (N's dad) said YTA - just ask N if she cares, but they're sure she won't.
* N's mom says I'm NTA, but my delivery could have been better (I disagree - it was perfect for my husband).
* I don't have very many friends to ask, and I'm NOT asking N. Weddings are stressful enough without worrying about inconsiderate guest questions.

What do you think?

Edit: This got bigger than anticipated. And my very first silver and gold! Thank you all! I don't know how I'll get through all your responses, but I'll do my best.

I really don't care that he's jeans, t-shirts and boots. We live in small town in the Midwest. Preachers and undertakers wear suits here.

I just need him to not be so inflexible on something so stupid. You'd think I was asking him to kick puppies or cannibalize small children.

AITA for spending my Sons lottery winnings money?,16231,Not the A-hole,5000,cnxvrt,1565357211.0,"I have a wife (Wilhelma, 40) and two sons (Sam, 17, and Scott, 16).  6 years ago, I ran to the gas station to buy some cigarettes.  Instead of abandoning my family (just a joke) I decided to also buy a lottery ticket for everyone, just for fun.  It was a blast.  We all talked all night about what we would do with our winnings, where we would go, etc.  I mean, this was all fantasy anyway, right?  But I specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings, and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  Well wouldn't you know it, Sams ticket won.  Of course its actually MY ticket, and I had to claim it.  It didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.  I sat them both down and explained that I was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  They absolutely wanted a gaming system, and Wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  We all agreed on this, and saving the rest.

&#x200B;

I bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k.  Wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a Disney World trip.  The boys don't even like Disney, but it was always Wilhelma's dream to go so we went.  Another $5k.  Last year, Sam wanted a car.  Wilhelma was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so I agreed and spent ""his"" $4k on a car.  I pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the agreement that he takes over driving Scott to his stuff as well.  Wilhelma had no complaints about any of these purchases.  

&#x200B;

Since day 1, I've actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it.  I've always spent my OWN money on all this stuff.  I have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k.  Wilhelma knows I have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor.  She knows I was investing the lottery winnings as well.  I've always told her about the money doing well, but I guess I never explicitly said how well.  She also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.  

&#x200B;

Sam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  While looking at the portfolio, Wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  I told her I invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  She then asked why we're only giving Sam $30K when it should be $50k.  I said no, the other $40k is mine.  I managed this account, I made the investments, I did all of the work.  Plus I paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. The $40k stays and I'll keep investing it.  If the boys NEED the money, its there, but if not I'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it.  She thinks I'm stealing ""his"" money since I wouldn't have been able to invest with it if I didn't have it to begin with.  I say its always kinda been my money, and I'm still giving him the $30k I promised him since the beginning.",False,False,2019-08-09 06:26:51

The thing that takes my cake is that yesterday was my birthday and the day before that we were deciding what to do for it. I said I wanted to go to to the Met and get lunch there. She says she doesn’t really want to do that and I say it’d be nice if we could for my birthday. She starts crying and we end up going to her moms house for my birthday.

Today she called me and said she wanted to go shopping and I said no, she starts crying and I finally get fed up and tell her she can’t just cry whenever she doesn’t get her way and that I’m not going. She then cries more and says that I don’t care about her, so I just hang up. She’s blown up my phone with texts.

AITA for not building a relationship with my dad's affair partner / new wife?,16151,Not the A-hole,1655,ebx4az,1576624888.0,"I am in my second to last year of high school and last year I found out that my dad was cheating on my mom with an employee of his. I told my mom because I knew my dad would never own up himself, and they got divorced. During the divorce, my mom was having a hard time coping and turned to drugs, and she got found out, now my dad has custody and I only have visits with her. 

It's all been really hard on me, and on my mom, and I resent my dad and how everything seemed to work out for him. He's married his employee and she's pregnant and living with us.

Anyway, I've been polite to her because I don't want to screw myself over and make my dad too angry to pay for college. But it's the kind of ""nice"" I put on at my customer service job, a smile and pleasantness, but not actually getting to know her personally. It's hard for me to even do that, it's like a lot of emotional labor that I don't want to be doing in addition to school and work.

Like for example, the kinds of stuff I'll say...

If she asks me about school, I'll be like ""It was nice, we had a nice lecture on genes in class"" or she asks me about my teachers and I'll be like ""they're nice, they all seem very smart"" or she'll ask me about a movie I saw and I'd be like ""It was good and funny"" 

Just like trying to be positive and polite. But last week, she lost it at me and was like ""Why is everything NICE with you? How's school? NICE. How's work? NICE. Your father says you hate your science teacher, but all you ever say to me is that everything's NICE like a broken record"" and I was like ""sorry. I really do mean it, school has been good"" 

Anyway, later my dad talked to me and said not to play dumb, he knows I don't really think all my teachers are nice, don't like the actor in the movie I saw, don't really mean all the stuff I'm saying. And he and his wife can tell, and it's hurting because they both want me to be genuine.

I said ""ok I'll try"" but TBH it is tiring enough for me to just be polite let alone genuine. Plus I feel like I'm genuine, and talk about what's actually on my mind, such as my mom, and being worried about her, it will go over even worse

I (23f) recently moved to a new city and made a some great friends through my local gym. We’re a group of girls and guys with similar interests (fitness/sports) and they’re all so friendly. They showed me around the city and made me feel really comfortable. 

One of my friends is this guy (Mark). Everyone’s fit but Mark is the odd one out because he’s quite overweight. He doesn’t go to the gym either but when we’re all hanging out (bar, dinners, fun activities etc) he always comes along. 

Mark is a really happy/bubbly guy and obviously the most beloved in the group. I could tell that everyone is very fond of him which I totally understand. He’s really kind and just a sweet person. Sometimes I tease him about his weight but it’s all in good nature and he doesn’t mind. Normally I get told to leave him alone but as long as he’s fine I don’t think I’m hurting anybody. 


So yesterday we were all hanging out together and one of the girls started showing me old group photos of their trips over the years. Mark looked REALLY different, I almost didn’t recognize him. He was very fit, muscular and super handsome. (He has a nice face anyway but without the excess fat you could actually see his amazing bone structure). I was shocked and pointed out that he used to look really good and asked him what happened. It wasn’t a mean spirited question at all, I just wanted to know what went wrong. 

Suddenly the room went quiet and EVERYBODY was shooting daggers at me. Then one girl said “that’s fucked up” and literally told me to leave. I was pretty confused and explained that I just wanted to know how/why he got so fat. Mark looked awkward and didn’t really answer my question. Everyone started berating me and standing up for him as if I’m some villain. Mark actually defended me and told them that it’s fine but they insisted that it’s not fine. 

Afterwards someone spoke to me in private and said that I should think before I speak and that I have no tact. Now everybody’s being weird with me and I don’t get why. They clearly think I’m an asshole but Mark doesn’t (otherwise why would he defend me?). Am I the asshole here? 
 


**TL;DR I asked my overweight friend who used to be in shape why he gained so much weight over the years. Everybody thinks I’m TA**

**EDIT: I have been informed that Mark experienced a severely traumatic incident a few years ago. I had no idea this was the case and obviously feel bad. I will apologize but completely understand if he doesn’t accept my apology.**

Update: WIBTA if I told my daughter to find a different hobby,16136,UPDATE,461,da44kc,1569636201.0,"Belated update to a post that was largely considered trolling, but wasn't. 

I won't lie when I say that I immediately ignored the majority of you telling me I was the asshole. Or maybe ignore is the wrong word. I think I expected that from the get go, so being told I ""peaked in high school"" and ""should get fucked along with all the plastic cheerleader wannabe SAHMs"" rolled off my back. But, there were a few of you that did make me think long and hard about my relationship with my daughter and what sort of model (haha) I was setting for her. There was one comment in particular that's been sort of lost to the flood (if you can find it, I'd surely appreciate that) that mentioned my writing and how well it read, almost like a book.

Maybe it's self absorbed, but that's really what made me stop for a moment. I've had to sacrifice a lot to get my family where they are today. I won't get into details because I'm sure it would be boring and pretentious and might make you all feel that I'm just trying to garner sympathy after being such a bitch, but it did involve giving up my dreams in order to make sure there was food on the table. I gave myself some time and space to think and realized the problem stemmed from me, not her. (Surprise) I was bitter that everyone else seemed free to chase their passions when I had to work at things I hated for the things we needed. It seemed childish to me to be so selfish as to enjoy your free time when you could be making an effort for your family instead. That's neither here nor there but it definitely wasn't my daughter's fault that I was so resentful. 

I like to think she was relatively unaware of my concerns with her hobbies (I never voiced my opinion one way or another and always drove her to Michaels) but I can say with certainty that our relationship has only improved in the last few months. I helped her build a miniature restaurant last Saturday and I've got a fun little carnival on my nightstand as I type this. I can't regain the time I've lost, but I can make sure she doesn't have to live the life I'm currently living.

A month ago she got into an accident that has her in a wheelchair. She’s been seeing a physical therapist about prosthetics but for now at least there’s no walking happening.

It’s been... an adjustment for both of us, and I won’t say it’s gone perfectly, but you can’t expect something like this to transition perfectly. I recently went out with a couple friends, and I was talking about my fiancée and how she was doing when one of them asked if I had thought about calling off the wedding.

I immediately said no and asked why I would, and she started talking about how she’s going to be a burden and I don’t want to start the better part of my life with dead weight as a wife.

This really pissed me off and I yelled at her that just because she got into an accident doesn’t make her worthless and that she should shut her mouth if only shit is going to come out of it. I’ll admit I made a bit of a scene, so I left and went home.

My fiancée says that I shouldn’t have been so harsh and that she can see where my friend is coming from and that she only has my best interests in mind. This honestly really surprised me since my friend was talking about her, and she’s saying I should have been less harsh. So I’m wondering whether I went overboard since the woman getting trashed even thinks I was too harsh.

Well sure enough we see this cat just sitting on the roof of a car and it looked just like the one in the reward poster. I walked up to it and it was super nice. I took a pic of it then we walked a block back to the poster to compare. It was the same cat. We went back and got the cat. It was real nice and let me pick it up. It just cuddled up. I think it was pretty scared. My wife called the number on the poster and they gave us their address and walked the cat 4 blocks to the house.

As we were walking up the sidewalk the kids in the house ran out and screamed in a happy way and grabbed the cat. The parents came out and thanked us for returning their cat. The mom had tears in her eyes. As they were walking back inside I said, ""oh, I noticed there was a $500 reward. Would that apply in this situation? If not, I totally understand."" The dad just looked at me with daggers and the wife looked real confused. She said in a kinda condescending way, ""you really want us to give you $500?"" I said, ""I'm not trying to be awkward or anything, but you did offer a reward and we did find your cat."" The dad said, ""Jesus, hold on"" and went inside and got $320. He comes back outside and said, ""All I have is $320 cash on hand. I can get you the rest if it's really that big of a deal to you."" I said, ""no, that's fine and he handed me the $320."" As they walked back inside the wife said under her breath, ""I can't believe he took the money"" and the husband said, ""yeah, what a dick."" They clearly said it loud enough for me to hear.

My wife is totally on my side. We live in a pretty affluent area so $500 (or $320) isn't a big deal to these people. I mean they had two Mercedes in their driveway nor is that money a big deal for me. However they did offer a reward and we did our part. I told my friends at lunch that day and half think I was right to ask for it. The other half said I should have just ""done the right thing"" and not asked for it.

Edit: My wife's and my parents think I should have just given the cat back with no reward. They think I was totally the asshole for asking for the reward.

AITA for saying my autistic older brother can't stay with me during holidays anymore?,16097,Not the A-hole,973,edqlks,1576967888.0,"Please excuse the bad formatting as i am on mobile.
For back story i grew up with my brother i (25f) and him (31m) so i know he can be challenging. I have always tried to have patience with him as i know he can't help doing some things due to his autism.
So this weekend i said him and my sister could stay at my house (the live over 4 hours away) i took the day off work to prepare for them despite needing the money. My sister calls around the time they should have been arriving to say my brother is throwing a fit and no longer wants to come to family Christmas. I understand i know how hard traveling and not having a set schedule is for him.
Fast forward 5 hours they finally show up at 11pm.
The second he walks in the door he starts screaming for me. I run over to see what he needs and if he's okay. He immediately ask where he can plug in his laptop and starts gaming. 10 minutes later he's complaining my house is to cold. I already have the heater higher then i want it and everyone else in the house is comfortable. So i give him an extra blanket and go to bed. He stayed up all night playing loud games and kept me awake. I asked him to go to bed multiple times. Then at 6am he comes in my room without knocking and ask for breakfast. I tell him to make cereal because i need sleep. I hear him scream and low and behold he has dropped my good glass mixing bowl on the floor and there's glass and milk everywhere. I'm 5 months pregnant have no sleep am hot (he turned my thermostat up to 82) and now have to clean this mess. I clean it up shower and tell him to be ready to leave in 20 minutes for my grandparents. My sister (22f) gets him his things then heads to my grandmas. I go to leave with him and he has gone to sleep. We were 3 hours late to Christmas because he refused to get up. We finally get there and my grandparents yell at me for bringing him late. I start crying and tell everyone I'm never keeping my brother at my house again and someone else can do it next time.
Now my family says I'm being an over emotional ah.
So AITA here?

Edited because i forgot to add. We no longer have parents my mom passed last year and my father left when we were young. My brother having autism and my sister being epileptic (she would have weekly seizures as an infant and small child) was to much for him.
Second edit to say thank you all for the outpouring support. I really thought a few people would think i was wrong but everyone here has been kind and helpful instead. We will be contacting his social worker and therapist first thing monday morning and looking into other resources for him. We just want what's best for him and this post has shown me we might have originally made the wrong choice.
I want to thank everyone for the advice and support.
Edit 3 i am trying to respond and read all the comments and give replies to questions. I have gotten over 600 comments. 
I only have the 1 sister.
She is the care giver because she volunteered as she has a stay at home husband who can help 24/7.
I am pregnant but divorced my husband 2 months ago so he is not in the picture. 
I want to thank everyone who recommend resources and i will be sitting down with my family and social worker to look into different,better options.",False,1576973832.0,2019-12-21 14:38:08
AITA for dming a girl who bullied me relentlessly in high school regarding her instagram post?,16085,Not the A-hole,775,ghs1yb,1589246855.0,"So I’m (21f) Asian. I went to a predominately white high school full of rich kids who were racist and super snobby. This one girl, we’ll call her B, bullied me relentlessly in high school and would make fun of my eyes (she would pull her eyes back when she saw me), call me Ling Ling, chink, ask me if Kim Jong Un was my dad, tell me to stop eating dogs, etc. All unprovoked, and I never said anything back because my Korean parents always told me to swallow my pride and take it.  She’s basically the worst human I know and she is part of the reason why I resented my asian heritage for so long.

I don’t follow her on social media because I don’t follow people I don’t care to keep up with.  She’s trying super hard to be an “influencer”, and there has been this trend going around called the “fox eye trend” where girls will pull their eyes back just like they would when they mock asian eyes in the attempts to look more “chic”. While this trend has made me upset because the feature I could not control and was teased for my entire life is now being considered sexy when non asian girls do it, I realize I don’t have much control over things like this so I just ignore it.

B posted a picture in this pose, pulling her eyes back, with some caption along the lines of “am I bella hadid yet?” 
This pissed me off (admittedly more than it should have) because she looked no different from when she pulled her eyes back to mock me. I saw the post because my friend, who was always there to listen to me when I was hurt by B, sent it to me, and we had talked about the fox eye trend a couple days ago. I then   in the heat of the moment dmed B saying “no, you don’t look like bella hadid, you look like the racist you are.. but like.. chic!”. She read the message, said “what the fuck..?”, and took down the post (I should make it clear that there were some comments NOT FROM ME on her post about the fox eye thing being problematic. I wasn’t the only asian she bullied). Now I feel bad for making a big deal out of something that might have been nothing.
AITA?

Edited because I realized I was kind of rambling lol.
ALSO: Just to clarify for those who keep saying to stop looking at her posts: Again, I don’t. I haven’t since I left high school because I don’t care. She posts racist stuff on twitter these days about asians because of coronavirus, which I only see because of twitter’s stupid “people you follow follow this person” feature. My friend ssent me this post specifically because we had talked recently about the fox eye trend and seeing  B doing it was just... amazing.",True,1589241609.0,2020-05-11 18:27:35
AITA for essentially siding with my family instead of my wife over their precautions for our incoming newphew?,16074,Not the A-hole,2348,dsxso0,1573162513.0,"Throwaway cause reasons.

Backstory: my wife and I have two kids (9F, 4M). My wife got pregnant very easily, our first kid was even an ""oops"" baby. She had relatively easy pregnancies comparatively, and extremely easy labor comparatively. No major complications or anything like that. 

On the other hand, my brother and his wife have been trying for years and had to endure medical surgeries for my SIL, and utilize IVF in order to finally get pregnant after spending who knows how much money. So when they finally got pregnant, they made it a much bigger deal then I would say is typical even for a first baby for a couple. For example, their baby shower instead of being sort of typical with close friends and family at like someone's house and opening gifts and such was at this very expensive venue with extravagant catering and it was formal attire and they didn't even open presents. My wife was involved in the planning for this, and it was during this that she started to kind of get annoyed with my SIL. She would plan certain events and fun typical baby games and it would get shot down by my SIL and she would basically replace it with her own idea. So that whole event left a bit of a sour taste for this whole pregnancy ever since. Otherwise everyone in our family has been supportive and excited. The baby is due at the end of this month.

So last night my wife received a Facebook message thread, including my parents and other family, from my SIL that said in order for any of us to see the baby (either in the hospital after he's born) or later back at home, we would need to bring our vaccination records to show that we're up to date on certain vaccinations and have gotten our seasonal flu shot. My wife lost it. She started saying how completely insane my SIL and brother are being, and basically is over the pregnancy and doesn't care to meet our nephew. 

While I said that I agree they are being a bit on the extreme side, I can sort of understand how they're like extra precautious because of everything they've been through to even get pregnant, and in all reality this is probably their one and only chance. They can't afford to go through IVF again and my SIL is too old it would be high risk anyway. My entire family, including the kids, are all up to date on our shots, so it's not like it would be hard to comply. We would just need to get our records. I also said I can understand in this day and age with the antivax community you never know who has what, so I can see being careful around strangers, but they should trust family members that we wouldn't put our own family (the baby) in harm's way. But overall, I sort of understand why they're being careful and it's no big deal.

Well she took this as me siding with them over her. She's been angry with me ever since. AITA?

(Also, please don't reply with ""YOu sHOuLd AlWays SiDe wiTH YOur WiFE! hUrrr Dee DurRR"". I don't agree with that statement and it's not helpful... Don't bother.)

Edit title: Nephew :/

Edit 2: While my wife didn't explicitly say it, just knowing her well enough I think the reason she's upset isn't because they are asking for vaccination paperwork in general, but asking us (and my parents). We are pretty close. We all live like 30min away and see them frequently and at every holiday. They watch our kids, we watch their dog, etc. There's always been full trust between us. And I think she feels insulted like we're not being trusted. I don't know if that changes anything? For those of you that said you also asked for shot records, did that apply to everyone including close family?

Edit 3: Holy cow, this blew up since last I checked. First of all, thanks so much for the comments, opinions, and advice. To address some common questions/comments... 1) No, SIL has no good reason to think we would lie about being vaccinated (or anything else for that matter). Once again, we're all really close, if anyone in the family was an antivaxxer, we would all know. And there's no previous issues with trust that has ever existed. 2) No, we did not ensure family was up to date on shots when our kids were born. I feel like the whole antivax thing wasn't as prevalent at the time maybe? It was a while ago, don't exactly recall. 3) It is highly unlikely my wife is jealous of the baby shower or attention of the pregnancy. She's a total introvert and would rather die than have the type of baby shower my SIL had. It was more the fact that my SIL rejected all her ideas and basically planned it herself. 4) I probably shot myself in the foot on this one with the title... But I didn't really ""take a side"", at least I wouldn't consider it that. It's not like I said, ""Well hun, they are right and you are wrong"". It was more the fact that I wasn't as outraged as my wife about the whole thing that made her think I was taking their side (I think?). So take that for what it's worth. 5) I appreciate the folks that could also see both sides of the coin... I feel like that's what I tried to do here. Maybe I didn't handle it to perfection and I agree it will probably blow over (hopefully). Maybe I'll send an update if anyone is interested.

Edit 4: Just cause it's hilarious that I actually have to address this... But no, I was not implying that just because the baby is IVF or their ""one shot"" that the baby's life is more valuable than a more typical pregnancy baby. Not quite sure how some folks deduced that. I was merely saying that due to those circumstances I could more easily empathize with my SIL's somewhat extreme (imo) request for vaccination records, which is why it didn't bother me as much as it did my wife.",False,1573183420.0,2019-11-07 13:35:13
"AITA for telling an anorexic girl to ""stay the fuck away from my girlfriend""",16065,Not the A-hole,783,cuveg7,1566692348.0,"I've been dating my girlfriend for almost three years now (M18) (F17). Since she's considered a minor medically she was put into a youth anorexia program for her eating disorder. Shes been doing really well, improving a ton and making much faster progress than anyone there, (she knows and wants to get better but is still really mentally fragile). A girl was admitted last week for severe eating disorder, I'm taking fights nurses, refuses to eat and threatens to harm herself if they make her eat. My girlfriend told me that the girls been anorexic since she was 9, she's 17 now and has made zero progress according to her parents (she overheard, they share a room).

A few days ago my girlfriend mentioned that she's been trying to make friends with the new girl but she makes her severely uncomfortable. Basically telling her that she looks perfect the way she was and that gaining weight was going to make her unattractive to me. Shes also been telling her things like ""Why do you want to get better, you look so healthy"" and ""Wow your boyfriend must have loved your body, it's a shame"".

I eventually mentioned to a nurse that my girlfriend should be moved out of that environment ASAP and was moved to a different room yesterday. A few hours ago I went to visit and the girl basically confronted me and told me that I was an asshole for taking away her friend. 

Things eventually escalated and I left off yelling at her to stay the fuck away from my girlfriend. 

Am I in the wrong? I don't know how anorexia effects people mentally and am not sure if she even realized what she was doing was wrong.

AITA for flipping out on my boyfriend for eating my cake?,16067,Not the A-hole,4326,cr109w,1565956792.0,"My birthday was this past Monday, and my parents got me a cake for it, naturally. I'm originally from Michigan but go to school in Texas, and as a surprise my parents mailed me something called a 'bumpy cake'. They were like my favorite thing when I was little and I'm not sure if they're ONLY available in Michigan but I definitely can't get them in Texas. 

My boyfriend and I each had a slice of the cake, and then put it in the fridge. When I got back from work the next day I was super excited to eat more of it, only to find that not only was pretty much all of it gone, but it was butchered in a way that suggested it had just been eaten out of the box with a fork. 

I went into the bedroom where my boyfriend was and showed him the cake box. He laughed and said something along the lines of ""I couldn't help it!"" I called him a selfish asshole and told him I couldn't believe he felt so entitled to something that didn't belong to him. 

He seemed really shocked and upset and said he didn't think it would be such a big deal. He started apologizing profusely and said he'd get me another cake but I was so upset with him I just left. I came back a little while later and he had gone from sympathetic to angry. He said he couldn't believe I was so mad at him over a ""stupid fucking cake"" and he ended up storming out. 

I realize it seems stupid and I might have overreacted, but I still think it was completely out of line for him to do that. I've told some friends about the situation and they similarly thought I was being ridiculous and that I shouldn't have been so mad over cake. 

Am I the asshole?

UPDATE: I've gotten a few messages asking for an update, so I figured I'd post one here. I haven't been able to read every comment, but I've looked at responses from every viewpoint and have taken everything to heart. A lot of you seem to think I'm just really stingy with my cake, but what I articulated to my boyfriend this morning was that I moreso was extremely upset that he felt entitled to what was essentially my birthday present. 

When he came back he had cooled down a lot, and we talked about everything. He apologized for eating all of the cake, and I apologized for losing my temper about it. When we argue we both have a habit of leaving instead of letting the argument escalate. I'm still not sure if this is the right move or not.

AITA for getting upset at a couple sitting in my seats?,16063,Not the A-hole,2898,ekodtv,1578311537.0,"Context: I bought two $124 tickets to an NBA game for a friend and I. We decided that we would watch the first 2 quarters, get up at halftime for the bathroom and food, and then make it back before the 3rd quarter started. 

When we got back from the bathroom, there was a couple in our seats (no big deal). But they were eating those stadium peanuts that make a MESS, and guess what? I am deathly allergic to peanuts. 

Me: “Excuse me you’re in our seats, can you guys please get up?

Guy: “Oh yeah my bad”

That’s when I see how much of a mess is EVERYWHERE. Our seats are literally the only 2 in the row. A row of JUST 2 seats. And this guy and his wife just have 2 bags worth of peanut debris and dust all over our chairs. We were gone for maybe 15 minutes. 

Me: “Dude really? I’m allergic to peanuts and you have absolutely trashed our seats”

Guy: “How am I supposed to know that?”

Me: “You’re not! You only know that because you are in MY seats that I paid for making a mess with peanuts, now please leave!” ( a little rude but I was heated)

Guy: “Don’t talk to me like that”

Me: “Or what?

So lay it on me, am I the asshole?

EDIT: people seem to not understand peanut allergies, so here’s an ELI5: if you ingest a peanut, your body goes into immune overdrive, essentially killing you while thinking it’s defending. If it touches your skin (depending on your severity) you will break out into hives which in my opinion from the time I did eat nuts, was the worst part of it all. No I won’t die, but I was scratching myself until I was bleeding once. EATING and TOUCHING nuts with an allergy is different.

AITA because I refuse to spend money on my ex’s kids despite being well off?,16018,Not the A-hole,1902,ch5rpd,1563988037.0,"I have a 16 year old son and he has 4 half siblings who are all younger than him. I was only ever with his mom for a brief period of time, and we both agreed prior to sleeping with each other that we were on the same page about not having a kid. 

Obviously that didn’t work out because she got pregnant (I did practice safe sex and wore rubbers but hey, I’m a dad now anyway)I asked her to abort, she told me she’d changed her mind, and she kept the baby.

I wasn’t thrilled about being a dad, after paternity was established I set about paying child support and that was it. I had no intention of wanting to be in his life especially because my own parents had kicked me out and I was still a kid myself.

After a few months though I felt the need to be there and actually be a father, so I put aside my own feelings and put him first. we are incredibly close today and I’m so glad and grateful that I got to be his dad.  I was 18 when I had him, and over the years I was lucky enough that I was able to become financially independent and in essence retire early so I’m able to give my son experiences that I never had. 

He chose to live with me when he was 11, which was a huge sore spot for his mom, but he’d always beg prior to that because his brothers and sisters would break his stuff, and he’d get yelled at because he’s the oldest, etc. 

His mom has always been courteous, but over the last few years she has become more and more resentful that my son gets more than her other kids. She is by no means poor, but obviously her resources are spread over 5 kids whereas mine is spread over 1. 

It was his birthday last week and as a gift I bought him a car, which he’ll be needing soon anyway and which I’ve had the cash aside for for *years*. When his mom found out, she called me furiously on the phone and told me I that I’m a piece of shit for making her other kids feel bad, because I’ve ‘never spent a penny on them and every time he goes to visit it’s obvious his dad is spending money on him’ ... I snapped back and told her that what, she expects me to shell out on kids I have no obligation to just so she doesn’t feel bad? 

She said that all the years of them seeing my son go on vacations, his clothes, his mannerisms (what?) etc made her and her kids feel bad, and she told me that I was selfish for having a fund for ONLY my son because none of her other kids will be able to afford college. I told her that’s an unfortunate reality for kids who have different parents and it is what it is. 

She’s normally pretty level headed so I honestly have no idea why she thinks it’s acceptable to ask me to pay for her other kids too- I’ve never tried to flaunt anything via my kid, I just want him to have the best I can give him.",False,False,2019-07-24 10:07:17

He loves the show Nailed It and I thought it would be cute and fun to plan him “his own episode” with two cake challenges for just the two of us at home since we couldn’t go anywhere due to current circumstances. 

I put like 60 hours of planning into this day. I handmade umbrellas out of paper and toothpicks for drinks and drew a cartoon character he likes by hand on each one. I blew up those big gold number balloons with a straw. I batch made blue Hawaiians since he had wanted a tiki birthday. I got all the materials for a cupcake and full sized cake challenge that I carefully planned. I spent 2 days baking.

When it came time to play and I surprised him with the game (which would take 45min-1h), he sat there motionless and said he didn’t want to play and that his birthday always sucks and no one does anything for him and that he shouldn’t have to work on his birthday. He just wants to eat cake and this is a stupid idea. He likes to *watch* the show, he doesn’t want to actually try it. No one cares about him. He’s all alone on his birthday and didn’t get to see anyone, etc.

I cry about how I tried really hard and I’m sorry he thinks my idea is stupid but I thought he’d love it. He says I’m yelling and it’s not fair that he’s getting yelled at on his birthday. He leaves and slams the door to our bedroom. So I cry for like 10 minutes and then leave the apartment for a couple hours because I’m hurt. I return and he cries about being alone on his birthday. Then I make the cakes myself because I spent like $100 on the supplies and I thought someone should.

This morning he is crying again and saying all the same things. I told him I hear him, he didn’t like my idea but I tried and didn’t forget him. I really thought he’d like it. Then I cry because I tried and I’m hurt and he didn’t need to be so cruel about it. He states again his birthday always sucks, no one ever thinks of him, and I don’t listen to him or care about him. He didn’t get to see anyone (cause I don’t count as a person?) (note:he also got a lunch party from his sister and brother in law), his birthday sucked because he “got yelled at,” and he just wants one day where people think of him.

AITA for telling the cashier to fuck off and subsequently demanding her to get her manager because she had a condescending attitude towards me buying condoms?,16020,Not the A-hole,903,caa0l4,1562552480.0,"I’m really, really pissed off at this girl I just encountered and idk if I’m just being an immature teen or if I’m justified.  Basically I went to the Walmart down the street because I needed condoms. I’m 16 and have been told I have a baby face but I guess that’s just how it is.

The condoms are locked behind a cabinet thing I guess because of theft or something idk but I asked a lady who was on shift, but wasn’t doing anything if she could open it up. She made a comment “Aren’t you a little young to be needing those young man” which really caught me off guard and I sorta just stammered and studdered and kinda embarrassed myself and I just mumbled again that I needed them. 

She basically made a condescending exaggerated “hmfph” noise and said “I outta really call your mama and tell her what you’re doing instead of helping you act a fool; you know you don’t need to be using these” before moving towards the condoms. My mom and I go shopping here often so while I personally didn’t know this lady, it’s not unlikely that she has seen me walk in here with her

Here’s where IDK if I’m TA because she WAS getting the condoms, but her threat pissed me off and she was being such a huge bitch the entire way that I basically aggressive said “it’s none of your business for why I need these, fuck off and do your job”. She was taken aback at this point and people started to stare and she was like “excuse me?” and I said “you heard what I said”. 

She said I’m not going to be doing anything and I needed to watch my mouth and she’s not going to get anything for anyone with that kind of attitude and that’s when I got really mad because she was wasting my time and humiliating me in front of the entire store and so I said “Give me a manager if you don’t want to do your fucking job then” and she stammered before refusing, so I ended up asking another employee.

AITA for telling my sister’s boyfriend that she’s been lying about her pregnancy and subsequently blowing up their relationship?,15994,Not the A-hole,1598,fes4eh,1583596415.0,"So this is a doozy. Will keep details vague in case anyone recognizes us. 

So my older sister has severe issues, including some kind of undiagnosed psychosis and borderline personality disorder. 

Last year she started dating this really great guy that she met in her church group. He sort of knew about her issues but not completely. She was really good for a long long time. Then it fell apart a few months ago when they had some kind of massive fight over something and in an attempt to “win” the fight she told him she’s pregnant (she’s not). 

She confessed to me and our mom about it because she was scared that if she told him she actually lied in the heat of the moment he’d leave her. So she told my mom that she was gonna wait a few weeks then tell him she “miscarried.” I was really upset and told her this is messed up of her to lie like this, but both she and my mom agreed this was the only way to “keep” this guy around. 

Well it had been more than a few weeks but she hasn’t said anything to him. She was still pretending to be pregnant!!! And she said it’s getting harder to lie to him because he keeps trying to go with her to her “doctor’s appointments.” And during this time I suffered a lot of anxiety having to be in on this secret with both of them. 

So this is where I could be TA... last weekend my boyfriend and I were out shopping when we bumped into this guy in a parking lot. I had been avoiding him since this whole thing started because it made me sick to think about being dragged into it. He was really eager to chat with us and after a while I couldn’t help it and it all just came out. My bf was trying to calm me down but I literally sobbed and spilled everything and honestly it felt so much better just saying it out loud to anybody.

Long story short. I hear from my mom that he and my sister are obviously not doing well. Fighting all day, and she is no longer talking to me.

I feel immense guilt but also relief for no longer having to carry this secret but now I think my family will blame me for my sisters unhappiness forever.

AITA for not asking my singer friend to sing at our wedding/ refusing to allow her to ‘gift’ us her singing voice?,15994,Not the A-hole,1162,g9xn96,1588143311.0,"This is very awkward and I’m not sure who to ask so I decided to post on here. 

My boyfriend proposed last year around Christmas, and of course I immediately said yes and together we have been very excitedly planning our wedding. We were due for September this year but have obviously put everything on halt. 

One of my friends, Abigail, is a singer. She has a very gospel-ly kinda voice but as awful as it sounds all I think when she sings is ‘this is warbly’ and I have to fight to keep a straight face. She’s not awful, but it’s really not my cup of tea. 

Obviously I would never say that to her but I do encourage her passion because one day she wants to turn her hobby into a career. I always respond in the group chat with constructive feedback when she sends us voice clips asking for it and if it’s very bad I’ll just stay quiet and not say anything at all. 

Now recently in January a little known music producer (I think) retweeted a video of her singing and she has taken this as her sign that she is about to break it big. 

She asked why I hadn’t asked her to sing in our wedding, and I answered honestly that I want her there in a friend capacity, not there to work. She then said she insisted on ‘gifting’ us the song to our first dance. 

I really, *really* don’t want her to do this so I told her I would need to square it with my fiancé as we are making all decisions together. Thankfully he was on board with me and I texted her ASAP to say that fiancé wasn’t keen on the idea because he *really* wants x band to play instead. 

She became upset in our chat group and quite a few of my friends are texting me telling me I should give her the platform and that I’m being a bad friend and an asshole, and that I’m being selfish.",False,False,2020-04-28 23:55:11
AITA for not leaving my parking spot because someone honked at me?,16046,Not the A-hole,1249,hfvw2d,1593153799.0,"Hello

So on my (19m) trip to the grocery store, I ended up scoring a non-handicapped parking spot right by the front of the store..

It's super hot here, so I decided to grab an ice cream bar. I was unwrapping it in my car, fully intending on driving off once opened (so I could eat and drive), when some old jerkoff starts honking at me and wildly gesturing at me to get out of the spot. 

Now, if I had been eating a meal or something I would've understood their frustration, but I had been in the car maybe 30 seconds. He rolled down his window and started yelling at me, at which point I turned off my car, and settled in to eat my ice cream. 

It caused a pretty big scene, as he ended up getting out of his truck (leaving it in the parking lot, not parked lol) and yelling at me, calling me names, swearing, all of it.

After I finished my ice cream, maybe five minutes later, I waited for him to ""do a loop"" looking for another spot, and promptly reversed, allowing someone else to take the spot. 

I felt pretty justified with that reaction, but when I told my mom she was disappointed, saying that I caused an entire commotion for no reason.

AITA?

TL:DR - I didn't give up my parking spot for five minutes because some old dude started honking at me.",False,False,2020-06-25 23:43:19
AITA for making a dick dip?,15967,No A-holes here,1216,ffvnyp,1583793723.0,"A few months ago, my (F32) brother Mario (29) got married to a lovely lady, Kate (29). Kate and her family are nice people, but they’re extremely formal, and can be a bit cold. My family, on the other hand, is extremely casual. We love to joke around and poke fun. I think if Kate’s family were to describe my family, there would be comments about propriety and lack thereof.

The day after the wedding, Kate’s parents hosted brunch at their house. When I arrived, I walked into the living room. Sitting there was Kate’s dad, her grandma, and my other brother. On the coffee table, there was a large serving platter. On the serving platter, there was a dip that had been prepared in a mold. You don’t see a lot of dip molds these days, so [here’s a visual](https://www.createdby-diane.com/2010/07/how-to-make-dip-more-appetizing.html) to give you an idea of what I’m talking about. This dip was a little different. It was about a foot long, in the unmistakable shape of a penis and testicles.

When I saw it, I thought I had misjudged my brother’s new in-laws. Food in the shape of dick and balls? What could be funnier than that? They had clearly been hiding their great sense of humour all this time. As soon as I saw the dip I burst out laughing.

“Something left over from the bachelorette party?” I said.

My brother’s father-in-law looked me dead in the eyes.

“It’s a lobster,” he said.

As other guests arrived, it became clear who was in my family and who was in Kate’s family. My family were all making thinly veiled penis jokes, while Kate and her family ignored us and pretended there wasn’t a giant dick on the table.

“So creamy,” my cousin said as she dug into the shaft with a cracker.

“They should have put some sprouts around the base,” my aunt said.

For months, I’ve been telling people the dick dip story, and anyone with a sense of humour thinks it’s hilarious. Last weekend, I had some people over to my house, and as a joke, I decided to make my own dick dip. Out of respect for my sister-in-law, who lives in a different city, I did not post any photos of the dick dip to social media. Some of my friends, however, couldn’t help themselves. Kate saw photos of the dick dip on a mutual friend’s Instagram story, and now she is upset.

I haven’t heard from her, but my brother called me and said I’m disrespecting her and her family. He says I need to apologize. In my opinion, I didn’t do anything wrong and Kate should lighten up. It’s a dip in the shape of a penis. Relax.

AITA for donating sperm to one friend but not another?,15969,Not the A-hole,1215,fuk7n9,1585989972.0,"I (29M) am a gay man with many queer friends of various sexual and gender identities. I am in a long-term relationship and actually love other people's kids, but am uninterested in ever having my own children. 

Two years ago, one of my oldest, closest friends (a lesbian who we'll call M, now 30F) and her wife asked me if I would consider donating sperm so they could have a child. I love M as much as I love anyone, and was super honored that she'd asked. I said yes. M and her wife now have a lovely baby girl who I act as an ""uncle"" toward, and who I love very much in a ""this is not my child but I hope to know her for the rest of my life"" kind of way. 

About a month ago, another good friend (nonbinary, call them J, 28) and their partner (nonbinary, 33) told me that they were also interested in having a child. In case it's not obvious, they are both biologically female, so they can't have kids together lol. They told me that they were wowed by how well my decision to donate for M had worked out, and were hoping to do the same. They told me that they would be honored if I would consider it, and that they'd love it if I had the same sort of relationship with their child that I do with M's daughter. 

In the past, I have told many of my friends that I would be open to donating again, under the right circumstances, and in fact there is yet another lesbian couple that I'm quite close with that I've discussed donating to once they reach that point. Like I said, I love kids and as long as I'm not considered a ""father"" in any way, I don't mind spending ten minutes giving people I love the opportunity to live their domestic dreams. 

However, with J and their partner... if I'm being honest, I don't think they're ready to have children. The two of them have been off-and-on for several years, with both of them cheating on each other at various points (the last time being only about six months ago). I care about them both very much, but they're honestly pretty immature. I didn't feel comfortable with the idea of being involved with their (rash) decision to have a kid, so I told them that while I was honored they asked, I wouldn't be able to donate.

I didn't tell them why, but obviously they've heard me say before that I'd be down to donate again, so they were understandably surprised that I declined. After they pressed me for my reasoning, I told them that I didn't feel comfortable giving a child to a couple that I honestly didn't think were ready for it. They were very offended. They told me that it's not my place to judge whether they're ready for kids, and that it's messed up that straight couples can knock each other up whenever they want, but queer couples have to be considered ""worthy"" of it. 

Obviously, I'm under no legal or moral obligation to produce any child that I don't want to produce. But I do understand that I've really hurt my friends, and a lot of our extended friend group is super pissed at me rn, so I'm here looking for some perspective.",False,False,2020-04-04 01:46:12
AITA for making my pregnant daughter move out before the baby is born?,15952,No A-holes here,4479,cnfixf,1565260926.0,"My 17 yo daughter (youngest and we had her late) is 7 weeks pregnant (she will be 18 by the time she gives birth) She is not in a relationship with the father. He reeaallyyy, I can't stress this enough, does not want a baby. I honestly don't even think he'll show up for the birth or anything.

She has decided to continue with the pregnancy against all advice from practically every adult in her life. After she insisted on not only continuing with the pregnancy but raising the baby I asked her how she is going to manage that? This was the jist of the convo:

Her: I'll get a job. 
Me: who's going to watch baby while you're at work? 
Her: I thought you and dad could.
Me: absolutely not, I'm not raising another baby.

Pretty much a back and forth for a bit that lead me to believe that if she has this baby in this house, I'm practically going to be its mother. I'm very recently retired  and my husband is retiring in exactly 11 months (there's a countdown) and this is not how I want to spend my retirement years. It's not fair to us. So I told her that she has until baby is born to find a place to live. Husband has always been wrapped around her finger (which normally is endearing, I love how much he loves our children) so he is not fully on board with that but I feel like we need to be united on this. I just want to know if  I'm in the wrong here.

"AITA for not apologising after I ""ruined"" my parents vow renewal?",15920,Not the A-hole,1333,gfboxf,1588903356.0,"Not a shitpost but definitely sounds like one so please suspend your disbelief and hear me out.

When I was 12 my parents divorced and began seeing other people.

When I was 14 dad met someone, ""Helen"". Helen had 3 sons. The oldest son, ""Jake"", was only a few months older than me. Of their 6 combined kids (I have 2 brothers) I was the only girl and was excluded a lot by dad, who would take all 5 boys to do ""guy stuff"" while I was left to my own devices. As a result, I only met my potential step brothers less than 5 times in the entire 2 years dad and Helen dated, and when I did it was all 8 of us at once, so there wasn't much 1 on 1.

When I was 16 dad proposed to Helen only to realise he still loved my mum. He and mum got back together shortly after, and remarried when I was 18.

When I was 25 I ended up indirectly working for Jake. We recognised each other and had a quick chat every now and again but due to the nature of my work we couldn't have any sort of relationship (including friendship) in case it looked like favouritism.

At 26 my contract ended and I moved to a new workplace. On my last day at my old workplace Jake asked if we could exchange numbers. We got together a few months later. We agreed to take it slow due to his son so it was very casual for the first few months and we only saw each other once or twice each month.

At 27 I tried to tell mum about Jake. Before I got to the part about him being Helen's son, mum started an argument because Jake has a kid, and I got so distracted by the arguing about Jake's son I didn't even get around to telling her who it was I was seeing. I called dad to try and tell him I was seeing Jake and he said he didn't want to hear whatever I had to say because I'd really upset mum and they'd contact me when mum was ready.

Now Jake and I are both 28, been together nearly 2 years. We moved in together last August. Mum sent me an invite to hers and dad's vow renewal back in January. Given current circumstances the renewal was moved online. I went into the office to take the call, logged in, greeted everyone, and found out a few people were late so we talked while we waited. During this Jake's son came in asking for help with his homework. Jake then came in to take him out, and dad saw him and went ""Jake?"". Mum said ""who's Jake?"". Dad said he was Helen's oldest son. Mum asked me what was going on and I told her we're a couple. Suffice to say, this was not taken well. Mum looked upset and physically left the room and dad apologised before ending the call and going after her. The call was still active and everyone else on it sort of said ""what the fuck OP?"" so I just awkwardly ducked out.

That was yesterday and since then I've recieved messages from everyone on the call (plus the ones who were late). They feel I should apologise for ""ruining"" their renewal.

I am an adult. I am sorry my parents were blindsided but I won't apologise for my relationship, plus if they'd heard me out 6 (edit: IDK when exactly, shortly after I moved in, possibly closer to 8 months?) months ago they wouldn't be blindsided now.

AITA for kicking out my friend which means she'll basically lose custody of her child?,15914,Not the A-hole,1464,edkwu9,1576929454.0,"My friend is a single mother going through a fight for custody of her 5 year old son. The son stays with the father most days and the father wishes for full custody. My friend and her ex are at odds due to my friend's living situation. She can no longer afford to live in her apartment and moved into a shelter briefly which becomes a unanimous ""no"" in terms of custody battles. If you don't have a permanent residence that's like a house or apartment, you will almost always lose these cases. I outstretched an olive branch and let her live with me. She's been here two weeks. I have a house so it's no big deal for me.

Something about me: two years ago I lost my husband and daughter in an MVA. I have dozens of photos of us all as a family, and about a dozen of my daughter. My late husband was a photographer and was the one who took all of our shots, not a cellphone photo in sight. In fact, I have precisely zero photos otherwise of us.

Two days ago was the first day my friend was allowed access to her child for the day and I was at work all day. I figured they'd hang out at home while I worked. It turns out her son got at my albums and destroyed or defaced pretty much all of them. I have no clean photos of my daughter anymore, they're either ripped to shreds or have marker all over them.

My friend did nothing to stop this: this doesn't happen in the time it takes to run to the washroom or anything so I deduce it was either my friend went out for an extended period of time leaving her son home alone or she just didn't care. In either case, I was furious.

I decided to give me friend three days notice to leave. She has no tenant rights as she's been here <30 days, in fact I had to give her no time but I didn't want to toss her to the streets with nothing. She leaves tomorrow.

Was I an asshole here? Her son destroyed property of mine of extreme sentimental value. I don't know if I can get them restored and getting new prints is impossible.

AITA? Told GF to move out and life has gotten 10X harder for her.,15884,Not the A-hole,1724,dp48tj,1572455799.0,"Hi

I'll keep this simple, and avoid going over the top.

In a nutshell my GF (33) and her little girl (7) moved into my (35/M) house last year.  The house is owned and I bought it because I have two children (8 YO twins - M and F) from a previous relationship.

When she moved her and her girl in I made it clear she was welcome to stay as long as she treated my house as she would her own.

Yet when she moved in her amd her daughter did the following over the last year or so.

- Left mountains of food everywhere.  - Left pans of food on the kitchen counter until it went green with mold.
- Got muck/handprints everywhere
- Broke and refused to replace things in my house
- Would leave the radiators, lights, gas on all day
- Refused to tidy up saying she was tired
- Left mountains of clothes everywhere
- Used the floor as a rubbish bin (ended up with mice)
- Constant drama, shouting, arguing - Witnessed by neighbours
- Literally drained me emotionally and financially
- Both of them gave me attitude non-stop, for no particular reason other than to stave the boredom.
- Put holes for shelves etc in all my walls
- Would spend money on fun things for her and her daughter, yet left me to pay the grown up things like bills, debt etc
- Kept leaving the toilet a mess
- Treat my own 2 children like dirt when they came over, ie shouting, drama, constantly blaming them for everything etc

When I questioned her on any of these matters she would say I was being controlling.

About a month ago, a serious argument erupted and I told her it's best she leave.  I said 'if you want to live like that, then go and get your own place'.  It was a shame for me to see my hard earned investment become ruined by someone with no respect for it.

We are still seeing each other, but now she has gotten her own place I feel terrible.  She's having to walk everywhere as she dosent drive, and her working hours have altered as previously I was taking her little girl to school to make life easier for her.  Also, she was only paying me £165 per month for everything, but now her bills will be in excess of £600 per month for her rent alone.

I feel dreadful for this, I feel like maybe I should have had more patience towards them or been a better guy when they were here.

AITA?  Or would anyone else have reacted in the same way?


Edit: Just to follow up - She doesn't drive and I also feel bad that now she has to walk/get the bis everywhere as before I was acting like her own private taxi service.  Ie, taking her shopping, giving her daughter lifts to school and to dance classes etc.

UPDATE:  Wow, didn't expect such a response from this!

After getting many responses, roughly 90% of which say I'm NTA and the rest saying I am for staying with her I've decided to break this off.
Like some of you've mentioned, I owe this to my children and myself to give them what they need.  A good, solid, strong dad who is happy and secure.  As of this point, she is no longer in my life.

A while ago I asked my 8yo daughter if she thinks about me when she's not at my house, her answer was:

 ""Yes I think of you getting shouted at by XXXX""

Some of you have said I'm a shit dad for staying with her after all of this.  I would argue against this, but if I stay with her I would have to agree with you all.

UPDATE:  I wasnt going to post this, but as many of you are asking about it as you consider it a factor, I'll respond.

A)  No the sex was mediocre at best, once a week if I was lucky.

B)  She never gave BJs

C)  She INSISTED on me giving her oral sex before we slept together.  Every time.  She told me ""Go down on me, or there is no sex""

He is 15. She had a ‘change of heart’ about being married to my grandsons father in 2018 who by all accounts is a hard working, humble man. She wanted a lifestyle change. Enter her new husband, an unemployed ‘actor’ with two children. He is irresponsible, shady, not trustworthy. I have caught him rummaging in my grandsons room in my home with no excuse as to why. There are other things too that make me distrust him. 

I have a lot of anger surrounding my daughters choice which in my opinion was motivated by selfishness- she took off and left my grandson with me and my wife while she went out of state for weeks on end throughout the past year to visit her partner, and my grandsons grades, happiness, and health have all taken an enormous knock. He has lost weight, misses his mother and father, is lonely and anxious. She doesn’t call him or care about him anymore.

The only reason my daughter is aware of this is because the purchase of the property was not something we were exactly able to keep secret. I decided to be upfront and tell her if she doesn’t want to be a mom, her own mother and I will do right by our grandson.

AITA for adopting a kid my friend's sister had planned to adopt?,15858,Not the A-hole,1286,g6ps43,1587688100.0,"It's been a couple years but a post on here reminded me of it and we lost several friends over this but still feel we were in the right.

My wife and I had adopted my niece Katie when she was 3, and when she was 6 we were looking to adopt another child. My wife's friend introduced us to her sister, Jill, who was also trying to adopt.

About 2 months into being friends with Jill she found a boy she wanted to adopt, Henry, who was 7 at the time. Jill took Henry out for the day. My wife and I were taking Katie to the park so we arranged to meet them there. Henry and Katie instantly got on. Henry was a great kid but very hyper, presumably because he was excited to meet Jill. Jill commented to me that she hadn't been able to calm Henry down all morning, and asked if we could watch him for a second while she took a breather. We agreed and spent the time talking to Henry, who seemed to fit in well with our existing family dynamic. Eventually it was time for us all to leave, so we went our separate ways.

Several weeks later Jill called me to say that the adoption had been rejected by the agency. Apparently Henry himself had refused it, so the agency had to decline.

A few months after that Jill found a different child she wanted to adopt and started the process, while we were invited to an open day at a local home, where several prospective parents/families meet the kids. When we were there we saw Henry. We were using the same agency as Jill and it was coincidence or luck depending on how you look at it. Henry remembered us, we still got on great with him, and we ended up adopting him. From what Henry has said, he rejected Jill as she didn't have a lot of patience and wasn't willing to work with him, while we were a bit more flexible.

We didn't tell Jill because at this stage we'd only ever met her twice (once for coffee, and then the park) and while we'd had some contact with her over text/phone calls we didn't know how she'd take this. We also didn't tell our friend, but after adopting Henry we posted an updated family photo on social media, which a different friend shared, and that was how the first friend saw it. She told Jill that we'd adopted him, and Jill replied to our post that she'd considered us friends and we'd adopted ""her son"" out from under her. We clarified the timeline immediately but our friends were shocked at us and we received several messages saying they couldn't believe we'd done that and saying Henry should essentially be seen as off limits to us because he'd rejected Jill, some even calling us ""greedy"" because we already had my niece while Jill had no kids. We felt that was absurd and ended up blocking most of them but to this day whenever we see any of them they're still appalled that we adopted Henry and even the people who supported us joke about about us stealing other people's kids.

AITA For telling my ex-husband's soon to be ex-wife that I (and by extension my daughter) will have no relationship with her?,15843,Not the A-hole,1554,gin1jq,1589354911.0,"I'll try to keep it short and sweet. My ex-husband cheated on me with his current wife. We divorced, they got together, and had a baby.

Well it's some years past that point, and surprise surprise, he's done it again. He and his wife are getting a divorce, and he's probably going to marry his new affair partner within the next 6 months if he follows the pattern. More power to him and his penis, I literally do not care what he does with his life anymore.

BUT I was pretty shocked to discover that his wife reached out to me, basically crying about what happened, how she couldn't believe it, and how now that we're in the same camp, so to speak, we should maintain a relationship so our daughters can still be in each other's lives and so we can commiserate.

Yeah, I told her to take a hike, and that if our mutual ex wanted our daughters to hang out, I was more than happy to schedule his visitation at the same time as hers so the girls could be together with their father, but that there was no way I was setting up sleepovers and playdates with her. I'm not bitter about it anymore, I'm remarried, etc. But I just want nothing to do with her. Haven't since the affair.

She about lost it, crying even more about how I would keep our girls apart because we both know ex-husband barely keeps up with his visitation, blah blah, and how he gets when he's in a new relationship. Yes, NOW we both know. But before only I knew, and she didn't seem too sympathetic about my end. She brought up how when she started up with my ex, she didn't know he was married, so I shouldn't hold it against her, and he's the one who cheated, not her. But I really don't care about any of that.

Anyway, she obviously called me an asshole, though not in so many words. My sister is also saying I should think about my daughter's potential relationship with her half sibling, but I think that should be on her father to orchestrate if it's important for him that his children bond and have a relationship. So lay it on me. AITA?

**EDIT:** Popular questions, my daughter is 8 almost 9, and her daughter is close to 7, either about to turn or just turned. My daughter is completely indifferent to her half-sister on her dad's side for various reasons explained in the comments but suffice to say, the indifference isn't new. They don't and have never had a sisterly relationship according to my daughter. She does not have any specific desire to see her (but is presumably fine seeing her while they are both with their father), but if she did want to hang out with her, we'd make it happen.

**EDIT:** Also asked about the state of schedule. My daughter sees her father, generously, 8-10 times a year, never more than a week, usually for a day or two. Between 2-4 of those are with his wife and daughter. This is likely to decrease slightly since he's in a new relationship. Assuming the same pattern continues, the girls will probably still see each other at least 3 times a year. A bit in the summer, for one fall holiday, and father's day. I have also encouraged her in the past to attend his daughter's birthday parties at least briefly.

My daughter is very close with my other daughter and her stepfather, which likely contributes to her disinterest, but isn't something I can really control. I've never badmouthed her father, his wife or other sister, but they just don't really sit prominently on our day-to-day radar.",False,1589344767.0,2020-05-13 00:28:31
WIBTA if I don’t disclose that I’m a product of incest to my present partner or potential future partners,15816,Not the A-hole,1226,d2s8ht,1568245784.0,"I (22F) was adopted as an infant and never really knew much about my biological family since it was a closed adoption. I received infrequent letters and photos from my biological mother. I connected with my mother, half sister and aunt during my freshman year of high school. I still really don’t know anything about my family because my biological mother  is a chronic liar. However, she did tell me that my father was no longer  around and had no interest in meeting me. I talked to my half sister and she said that she was told by our grandmother that it was due to him being a familial relation. I did some research, and was able to corroborate with DNA testing that he is indeed my mother’s first cousin. Obviously that was shocking, and I feel like my existence was a mistake. I’ve been struggling with it. Thankfully, from what I’ve read, there’s very minimal genetic overlap in that kind of relationship and I don’t have any medical issues. I do wear contacts, have ADHD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Auditory Processing Disorder, and I’m prone to getting lung infections (mother smoked while pregnant). But none of these are major in the slightest and I live a very normal, slightly more anxious, life. I’m in a relationship right now, I don’t know how long it’ll last or if it’ll last. I would love to eventually marry him but I’m 22 and I’m  being a realist here. WIBTA if I didn’t tell him since there’s virtually no chance our kids would have issues....and also I’m scared that he would break up with me because of it. 

Also before anyone makes any Kentucky/Rolltide, my bio family is from Ashland, KY. My life is a meme at this point

Edit: I honestly did not think this would blow up so much. Really glad this is a throwaway. I guess some info for people.

1. My mother didn’t know she and my father were related. Growing up she never knew her mother’s side of the family as my grandmother abandoned them for her second family. My parents were very much in love and dated as teenagers, it wasn’t a sexually abusive situation. They went to the same high school and they didn’t look related in the slightest, or share the same last name (I think their mothers were siblings). Mother found out when grandma got a divorce and came back into her life, I think they my parents were 18-19 
because it was right after high school. 

2. Boyfriend and I have been together about a year, which isn’t long but I can see it leading to marriage. Also he’s not American, so no chance of us being related! Trying to keep it out of the family. 

3. Views of incest are a bit different here in America for you non Americans. Especially since I live in a very religious area, my family are strict Catholics. It’s not illegal everywhere, but it is in some states.

**Edit 2** This blew up like crazy and I was certainly not expecting it! I really appreciate all the kind words and reassurance!  Ive been in my own head about this and I appreciate that so many of you are willing to offer advice!",False,1568249797.0,2019-09-11 16:49:44
WIBTA if I tell my lodger she gets no say on what house I buy?,15818,Not the A-hole,609,gxxay7,1591500364.0,"I (36F) live in a house that I own with a lodger (34F) who has lived with me for 9 years. We've had other lodgers come and go in that time but it's just the 2 of us at the moment.

For personal reasons there are bad memories for me in the house but I haven't been able to afford to move until now.

Recently I received some money and decided I'd like to sell my current house and buy a ""forever home"" where I plan to live until I'm old. Hopefully that house will see my lodger leave and me get married again, kids etc. over the next few years.

Lodger has suggested she would like to move with me, which is great as I like having her around and the rental money is useful. But has now started making a lot of demands about features the new house ""must"" have or locations where it ""must"" be.

She's lived with me a long time and I want her to be happy in the new place but WIBTA if I chose what I want and tell her that her choice is to move with me or find somewhere else to live but I'm choosing MY forever home and not taking her wishes into account?

I'm a part time wheelchair user and expect to need to use my wheelchair more in the future so there are already quite a lot of requirements when trying to buy a suitable place for my future.

EDIT: Wow, I wasn't expecting so many responses. Thank you everyone, I've read every response so far and will try to keep up with any more.I appreciate the NTA / NAH consensus but you've raised some good points about her expectations and understanding of the situation maybe being different from mine so I'll make sure I have a calm but honest discussion with her about life goals and expectations then make a decision about whether I actually want her to make this move with me.Thank you to those who have commented with thoughtful and insightful suggestions, it helps to stop and think about how she might be feeling and what her motivations might be.

EDIT2: Lots of people are asking what a lodger is. I own the house, she pays me rent to live with me. She has her own bedroom and shares the kitchen/lounge/bathroom etc with me. We are friends and get on together pretty well, as you'd hope after living with someone nearly a decade. She is not my carer and there has never been any romantic relationship between us.

My husband and I live fairly close to his parents (like 15 min) and his brother who has severe intellectual disabilities at age 36. 

My husband is a doctor and with the pandemic we’ve decided to live apart for the time being so he doesn’t have to worry about accidentally infecting me. So now I’ve moved in with my in laws and his brother. 

I love his in laws like my own parents. His brother, however, is another story. He’s disabled but he has an incredibly foul mouth and very offensive opinions that he’s formed from years surfing deep corners of the internet. 

But he’s disabled and is not all there sometimes, so I do my best to help out and keep my mouth shut. Last Saturday I was going on a walk with him (daily exercise) when we were walking past this big grocery store parking lot. We see a dad and son loading groceries into their car and my BIL started yelling racial insults at them (they were Asian). 

I was horrified and I tried pulling him away. But it was heartbreaking seeing the look on the little boy’s face and the exhausted/defeated expression on his dad’s face as they drove away. I was so angry that night I called my husband and basically told him I will rent a hotel room myself because I can’t stand another minute in the same house as his brother. 

It’s been a week and my husband has told me he can’t sleep because he’s so upset over what I told him. I admit I used harsh words and fully laid out my feelings. He said he still loves his brother and can’t stand the thought of us never getting along. AITA for telling him directly how I felt about this brother?

AITA for protecting my children who were technically born from an affair?,15780,Not the A-hole,3511,f4smld,1581897975.0,"I'm trying to keep this vague for obvious reasons. I'm in my mid-30s. I got pregnant from a one night stand. Honestly, I always wanted kids, and for various reasons, it's not likely that I'll ever have a long term partner. I've tried and had many heartbreaks. He's in the military, and pretty much ghosted me once I told him the news. It's fine, it was a one night stand anyway, hardly a love affair. 

I busied myself preparing for motherhood and welcomed twins. When they were just born, he was apparently back in town. He was shocked to see that I'd given birth, and came clean that he had a wife and she could NOT find out about this, but seemed pleased that one child was a boy (gross). I had no idea he was married, but I realized I had to act quickly. 

I promptly filed a paternity case and child support, making sure I could beat out his wife in getting an order as legally, child support is first come, first served. Whoever has the earliest date on the order wins. I knew my children would never get a dime past an order now, so I had to grab what I could for them. My kids were apparently also eligible for some military dependent benefits, which wouldn't hurt them.

Turns out, his wife has five children, all of whom would now get less in child support than my kids if she left him. My one boy is apparently the only male child, and he's apparently obsessed with that. Child support now also apparently takes a huge dent in their finances. She's a SAHM, which I figured but didn't know. She's financially trapped in her marriage now. I'm not a typical mistress and I only slept with him once and didn't know he was married, but to her I am. I'm only trying to protect my children as best I can and get them what they deserve.

AITA for refusing to babysit my nephew on my day off?,15774,Not the A-hole,1144,gdw9o5,1588708017.0,"Context. Story happened in early 2020. I (F31) have a brother (34), we're both no longer speaking to our parents. He has been with his GF for 10 years who has no sibling but is very close to her parents. Four years ago, they told me they were having a baby. Of course, I was thrilled for them.

Few months later, BOOM baby boy! (G) For reasons stated earlier, we're pretty small family, I'm his only aunt, I don't want children.

Here's the thing. While she was pregnant, B & GF kept implying stuff like how awesome it was going to be for them that I will be there for my nephew, for babysitting etc. TBH, at that point, it felt... awkward? Not at first, but they were really pushing it. Stuff like ""Don't worry babe, if we want a dinner date, we'll drop baby at auntie"" so I was very clear at the time : yes, I want a relationship with that kid, no, I won't  be a third parent. Ok to babysit, not to parent every time they feel like ""just being a couple"" in their words.

So I did that. I babysit only if I was available and with some notice. Sometimes, they have been very short (Like day before, because GP were not available, or something came up). Note that I ADORE this little boy, he is amazing and we're doing a lot of stuff together, but still. He is not my child, I don't want to have any, won't change my mind. I also have a very tiring job, with weekend and night shifts so sometimes, I really want to just be by myself at home.

Early February, B called, asked if I could have G for the day. I said no, that it was my first week-end off in months (Has been crazy at work and got promoted to manager) and I wanted it to be mine, relax, see some friends. He insisted. GF insisted. They both said ""G will be so disappointed"" but I stood my ground, I was so exhausted, I just wanted a weekend at home, not entertained a 3 years old with too much energy.

Then on the Saturday in question, at 8 am... Someone knocks. B, GF and little G. They were dropping him off because, well, I was going to stay at home and they really wanted to go out for the day in a different city. I was livid, told them the same things I already said while trying to stay calm because G was watching and listening. No, week-end off, not available, happy to see you, but goodbye. They did not want to hear anything. B told me that I was being selfish, that they told G he was spending the day with me and he was so thrilled etc, that I did not have kids so it was the least I could do etc. Stood my ground, again, told him me not having kids was in part because I knew I was not willing to sacrifice my days to kids, that I was not a third parent or at their disposal.

They left, G was upset/crying. Of course he was, he thinks I don't like him anymore for not wanting to have him, and I'm pissed for that. Friends think I should have agreed, for his sake, but I feel like they weaponized their son to make me cave and it's infuriating.

"AITA for telling my friend to remove his Mental Illness from his resume, to boost his chances of getting an interview?",15768,Not the A-hole,1790,fpv21h,1585335957.0,"A close friend of mine has bipolar disorder, and he is religiously committed to his treatment - he takes his meds on time, never misses out on any of his therapy sessions. He also has an incredibly supportive family and a wonderful, accepting girlfriend. I think he's thriving in his personal life and his diagnosis is being taken care of very well.

Anyway, he lost his job a while ago and has been applying ever since. He approached me with his resume so I could help him out because he was not scoring any interviews. At first I thought he was being hyperbolic but he actually applied to more than 95 places over a span of 2 weeks and got no calls. He has plenty of experience, excellent reviews and is more than qualified. So it was quite puzzling to me that he couldn't get any calls out of this massive exercise, but when I went through his resume I found out that he had mentioned in it that he has bipolar disorder and depression and that he is in treatment for it. That would explain his failiure rates, because of the stigma attached to mental health.

So I told him that he should consider removing it from his Resume. First of all, his mental health is his business alone. Second, he is being responsible enough by treating the condition for what it is - a health related condition. He wouldn't be writing that he has Asthma in his resume, for instance. He didn't have any objections, just that his Girlfriend told him that he should embrace his disorder and not shy away from it.

Later that night his gf texted me and politely told me that it wasn't right that I told him to remove it. It's a part of him and he shouldn't be hiding such things from potential employers. If they reject him for his diagnosis, they weren't fit to work at anyway. I put across my perspective and she just asked me to stay out of it.

AITA for refusing to wear a bra while my boyfriend’s friend is staying at our apartment?,15743,Not the A-hole,2556,cnqa5h,1565319717.0,"About a month ago my bf asked if his friend from out of town could stay over for a couple days and I said yes. So the next day his friend shows up while I’m at work. When I get home I greet the friend (who I’ve never met before). I then proceed to go to the bedroom where I change out of my work clothes and throw on a T-shirt and a pair of shorts with no bra. I never wear a bra at home as I find them immensely uncomfortable and hate them with a burning passion. I then go out to the living room to join them. As I’m sitting down the friend makes a comment, something along the lines of “dude, put on a bra”. I figure he’s joking since he kinda laughed before he said it so I just brush it off. He doesn’t bring it up again for the rest of that visit. 

Fast forward a few weeks and my bf wants to have his friend over again. So his friend comes over and this time I’m home when he gets dropped off.  I was not wearing a bra when he arrived. I would like to point out that I was wearing a rather baggy T-shirt so it wasn’t as if you could really see anything. That being said I do have enormous titties (I wear a size 40I bra). Immediately after walking in the door the friend says in an exasperated tone “I thought I asked you last time to please wear a bra!!”  I’m taken aback and I don’t really know what to say. I kind of stammer our a “what,why?” 

Him: I feel really uncomfortable seeing your boobs 
Me: But you can’t actually see my boobs 
Him: Are you kidding me? They’re huge! Of course I can see them! 
Me: Dude, I’m wearing a baggy shirt. At most you can see a bit of an outline. I don’t understand what about that makes you uncomfortable. 
Him: you’re joking right??
Me: No...? 
Him: fucking unbelievable

I look to my bf for help and he  kinda just shrugs at me. So I excuse myself to the bedroom. A little while later my bf comes into the bedroom to see if I’m ok. I tell him I’m fine, just a bit taken aback. He asks if I wanna come play video games with them in the living room and I agree. Before we’re out of the bedroom though he turns around and tells me that maybe I should put on a bra.  I had explained to him before how I felt about bras. He said he understood but didn’t want to make his friend uncomfortable. I was annoyed and told him I would just stay in the bedroom. So for the rest of his friend’s stay I stayed in the bedroom and only went out to go to the bathroom, get food, or go to work. 

So finally his friend leaves and everything is back to normal. Then last night out of nowhere my bf brings up the bra thing again. He tells me I should’ve just sucked it up and put on a bra and that I was kind of being an asshole about it. I feel like I should be allowed to not wear a bra in my home but also I wonder if I should’ve been more accommodating to a guest that’s very important to my bf.

AITA for not allowing my friend to bring her service animal (guide dog) to my wedding?,15805,No A-holes here,2240,hfzmkb,1593168553.0,"
I (28f) will be getting married in September. I have a blind friend who mostly relies on her guide dog. The dog obviously has access rights to all places.

Now I am in a sticky situation and I can sense that I will be TA. I have three chronic illnesses that I take 23 pill a day for, severe asthma and you guessed it, an extremely severe dog allergy. Usually when I meet with my friend we meet in the open and I take two allergy pills. However, because of all the other medication I take these pills make me extremely drowsy to the point where I am officially not allowed to drive and I usually crash as soon as I get home from our get togethers.

Our wedding will be very intimate, i.e. we will be in relatively small rooms. I feel horrible about this but I don’t think I can let my friend bring her dog. It just wouldn’t work. I talked about it with my fiance and some friends. Finally, I talked to my friend about it, explained the situation and said I would love her to come but she can’t bring her dog. I said that four of our mutual friends had offered to “be on a roster” and assist her should she need it. Alternatively, if she is not comfortable with this she could bring a person of her choosing to the wedding or I’d pay for a professional aid for the day. I think it is important to note that her dog is not for any additional issues like seizures or anything like that.

Unfortunately, she was less than happy with my suggestions. She accused me of being ableist and thinking her disability can be switched off for the day.

I understand what I asked was a lot and it is a difficult topic. I told her to tell me if she changes her mind and I’d be happy to make arrangements. But I won’t budge.

AITA for making a dark joke at my SO’s expense,15715,Not the A-hole,1579,e72nlq,1575686561.0,"Some context:

I’m extremely pregnant (like waddling Danny-DeVito-as-The-Penguin pregnant) and fighting a chest cold, back pain, bruised rib, overall fatigue, and a womb resident that won’t quit moving (which is a good thing, but can be painful!). I work from home, which makes it easier. 

My boyfriend has an abscess that requires a root canal. YIKES. I’ve never had a root canal, but tooth/mouth pain is no joke. He works in a field where he’s on his feet for sometimes 12+ hours a day. 

The setup:

Yesterday, he came home early after the dentist. Knowing that he’s been tired and feeling bad, last night I got him set up in bed, made him dinner (twice), picked up his antibiotics, brought him ice cream and tea, and overall just made sure he had everything he needed. I even slept in the other room, as I tend to get up a lot because pregnancy is uncomfortable and I didn’t want to bug him. Truly, I’m happy to do it. 

This morning, I woke up to a text from him that just said, “I need water.”

*I need water.*

I was annoyed, because even though he’s not feeling well, a tooth abscess doesn’t take away your ability to walk. I brought it to him anyway, and he made a big deal about lifting himself up to drink from the cup and take two ibuprofen. No “thank you.” Just put his head back down and closed his eyes. 

Pain is pain—I get it. I don’t have a monopoly on discomfort just because pregnancy can sometimes really blow. It’s not a competition. But it is kind of cringe-y to demand your pregnant girlfriend, who already has some mobility issues and near-constant pain, to grab you something you could easily get yourself. 

The AITA dilemma:

Trying to be lighthearted about the audacity of that text request, I drew a picture on his breakfast cup (something I do every day when I make his breakfast) of a tombstone with the words “I need water” on it, surrounded by flowers and with his birth year - 2019 on it. 

He was...not happy. Like, actually mad that I did that. He said my humor “is not normal,” and that it’s not at all funny. He left in a huff and without saying goodbye. 

So, AITA for the joke? Or am I missing the real issue entirely?

*ETA: We both apologized for not being considerate of the other person, and it’s all ok. He’s a good dude, just off his game today. Still doesn’t think I’m as funny as I think I am, though—lol.*",False,1575664312.0,2019-12-06 18:42:41
AITA for kicking my little brother out for not shoveling the walk way and side walk?,15716,Not the A-hole,1305,eabow7,1576308003.0,"My little brother (26M) lives with my wife and I (30f/30M), he used to live his GF, but since breaking up, he couldn't afford his own place so has been living with us since July, rent free.

My wife is due with our first child any day now (Her due date is Jan 2) and I have been working long hours at my job. The company I work for is doing a merge, and I have been putting in longer hours to try and get things done so that when my wife has our baby, I won't constantly be pulled away or called while trying to support her and our son.

My little brother works a trade that usually has next to no work during the winter (he does roofing and siding for his friends dad, and we live in Canada) so lately, he's just been sitting at home playing on his computer or going out with friends.

It's been snowing here pretty heavy the last 3 days, and now that its finally lightened up, we can  do the sidewalks. I called my wife on my break and she mentioned that some of the kids that come by have a hard time getting through the snow (we live by a school and on a corner lot, so we are responsible for shoveling the side as well) 
I told her to get my brother to shovel the walks, she said she asked him, but he told her he was  going out, (this was at about noon).

 I texted my brother and asked what time he would be home, he said around 2, so I asked him to shovel the walks when he got back, he asked when the last time I shoveled them. I got annoyed and told him again to please shovel the walks as I wouldn't be home till around 8, he didn't respond.

I got home and saw they were done, when I went inside, my wife was laying down and holding her stomach (just some Braxton Hicks she said) I asked her if she was okay, and she said yes, just exhausted from shoveling. I was furious. I asked her why my brother didn't do it, and she said he refused as he is not the home owner. 

I went into our basement and lost my shit at him, reminding him that he lived rent free in my house and ate my food. He told me I was over reacting, that it was just snow, and that him living there didn't mean he was obligated to do ""my chores"". I  told him to get out. He left and about a hour later I got a call from my mom yelling at me to call my brother and apologies, that he has no where else to go, and how I shouldn't be acting like this a few weeks before Christmas. I told her he needed to apologize to my wife and I, and that if he wanted to come back, he needs to be contributing going forward. 

He ended up staying at a friend's last night, and I have yet to hear from him, AITA here?

Edit: just wanted to add, my brother's response to  my wife shoveling was that she made that choice to do that, as he told her to wait for me. I've also had a coworker tell me it was a huge over reaction on my end, and that while my brother should apologize, I should as well.

Edit: thanks everyone for the responses, just to answer a few questions though: 

My wife told me it wasn't that big of a deal that she ended up doing it (she still shouldn't of had to though) and in our city, we usually have about 24 hours to clear the snow until a bylaw officer comes around, so I'm surprised they weren't around sooner (I'm assuming it was due to the amount of snow we were getting for 3 days straight) so that, plus my wife watching kids struggle, plus us being liable for any injury was her reasoning for doing it.

So yes I was mad that my very pregnant wife ended up doing it, but also his complete lack of respect to her and myself, asking me when I had done it last, saying it was a home owners job......

And as for my mom, her and my dad live in one of those 55+ retirement communities out in a county about 90 Min away, I guess he could stay with them for a bit, but I think it has to be okayed with the condo committee (I'm not sure how that works) 

I have also yet to hear back from my brother in regards to my stipulations about him coming back.

Edit: sorry, one more thing since I see it coming up alot. In my Province and I believe most of Canada, the Residential Tenancies Act doesn't apply to family members living with landlords, he is in no way legally considered a tenant in my home, so unless his name is on the deed to my house,  we can have him come and go as we so choose.

I ran in to the the office which was really crowded. There was only one secretary, and I knew instantly who it was- My mother and alot of other parents complain about her being a short-tempered smart ass.

I ran in but there was a line up, I told her my urgent need to talk to her right now due to my sisters allergic reaction and she looked at me and asked if I was blind ""there's a line hun"".

I waited for about 2 minutes before telling her this really cant wait, she put up a finger and picked up the phone.

I got upset and she called a hall monitor to escort me outside the office until she was ""Ready to talk to me"" I was yelling to tell her about my sister's allergic reaction yet she told me she didn't want to hear it. I was in absolute awe at her attitude, especially with the situation I was in.

I dialed 911 because it seemed like the school didn't give any fucks about my sister. The secretary saw me and ran out to to tell me to hang up.

She started by telling me ""See hun, I told you to wait for a reason- there was a mix up, A student told your sister that she gave her something w/ peanuts as a joke, we are dealing w/ that student right now, I could have handled this situation a lot better- I have a lot of students to deal with""

I looked at her and said ""what on earth are you talking about, my sister is deathly allergic and you expect me not to be worried and to wait and do nothing? Every fucking second counts in an emergency you fucking idiot, what were you expecting? Were you waiting to keep me on edge for as long as possible before telling me?""

I yelled at her for a bit more and she started to tear up and walked off, the monitor told me to leave ""The school isn't going to deal with a hysterical child, we are waiting for your parents, where we will then deal with your attitude""

Are you serious? How am I supposed to react in that situation? Yes, I agree I was really angry, but I feel like I was justified- My sister could have fucking died, all she had to say was there was a mix up- I would have waited if I heard a logical reason like that as to why she didn't need to talk to me right at that moment. AITA?

EDIT- 

To add context, some people are confused as to why I didn't immediately go to the hospital, the reasons why are because

1.) I don't know what hospital to go to

2.) they were not contacting me, even though im on her emergency contact

3.) from my understanding, she ran to a teacher and told her she was going to have an allergic reaction, so she got sent to the nurse and my mom was notified, before anything went down the idiotic student who tricked her, told the teacher that it was a ""prank"" and that she didn't actually have any peanuts, obviously it was a really dumb and small prank that turned in to a big situation, I guess the faculty themselves were confused about what was actually going on so they were unsure what to actually do.",False,1571437634.0,2019-10-18 20:20:38

It'll cost me $2800 dollars to attend (there's no option to adjust the dates/costs. it's for a full week).
My sister would be very upset if I don't attend.  My parents say I should go, and that I'm being selfish for saying I'm not going.  

My sister lives far away and we see eachother once a year due to cost/ busy schedules.   I don't make a ton of money, but I have enough money to attend the wedding and my parents and my sister know it.  While I really want to support her --and would attend a local/ more reasonabley priced destination wedding in a heartbeat-- $2800  just seems too much. And less importantly, I have zero desire to go to an all-inclusive resort as I don't drink or enjoy suntanning.

  In my defence, I've worked hard for my money and I sacrificed quite a lot to be where I am financially.  And while I have accumulated significant savings, it isn't because I earn a big salary. But, because I work long hours, and very rarely spend money on anything beyond the bare essentials.  The cost of this trip would exceed the value of my worldly possessions including my car.  It would also require me using a full week of what little time I get off work.

It's worth it to me, however, and I save money from my paycheques every month to go towards these purchases. I probably spend $80-100 a month on makeup.

When I got home from last night, my brother (28M) had his girlfriend over and they were watching a movie. I said hello and went on to do my own thing the rest of the night.

The next morning, when I went to put my makeup on, I couldn't find either of my mascaras, my eyeshadow palette or my red lipstick. I didn't start to panic yet, as I thought it could've been me or my mom who just moved something temporarily.

I WAS PISSED. I asked him what gave him the right to lend MY makeup to his girlfriend without my permission. He told me to chill out because he'd get it back from her tonight anyways. I told him that wasn't the point - it was MY stuff and he should've asked before just giving it to his girlfriend. I told him I didn't want her using my makeup because that's totally unsanitary. He got angry because I've let ""Olivia borrow my mascara before"" - Olivia is our sister, so to me sharing makeup with your sister (who reciprocates the favour) is a TOTALLY different story, and I wouldn't let her borrow my lipstick.

AITA for ignoring my step mother in front of her boss?,15646,Not the A-hole,1497,gn9oto,1590003057.0,"So I have been living with my step mother and dad for the past few months.

I really dislike my stepmom. She is always insulting me for things that aren't fully my fault (like being socially anxious) and she doesn't treat me like a family member.

She also refuses to use my real name, because that's her other (older) kids name too. She calls me by my middle name instead, which I absolutely hate. I told this to her a thousand times, but she just doesn't care.

Yesterday I went shopping with her for groceries. After we got out of the shop and walked over to the car, she noticed her boss a few cars away and went over there to talk. After a few minutes of me awkwardly standing by the car she shouted to me to go there and introduce myself, but she, as always, didn't use my real name. 

I decided to ignore her. I hoped that she will realize her ""mistake"" and correct herself, but she kept shouting my middle name. She gave up trying after a while and said goodbye to her boss very soon.

Needless to say, that she was extremely upset. She remained silent while she was driving home but I knew that I won't get away with this without a big argument.

When we got home she basically exploded: she was shouting at me for like twenty minutes of how I embarrassed her in front of her boss and that I'm immature and childish. My dad also took her side. He understands that I don't like being called by my middle name, but said that I should act like a grown up and know better than petty revenge.

Are they right? Was I acting childish and should I apologize?


Update: So I talked to her... She said that she didn't realize how much I hate my middle name, and that she doesn't understand why do I care so much. She also said that she's willing to call me by another name of my choosing, but not my real name, because that's her other daughter's name. I'm not saying that I'm happy with this, but it's still better than my middle name (sadly it's impossible to make normal sounding nicknames out of my real name)

I'm sorry that I can't answer everyone, but thank you so much for all the advice and support. :) I will try talking to my dad too when he gets home.

Plus, shoes, clothes, tools & stuff I know he'd like. He went shopping on 12/23 at 7 pm, alone. He gave me the kids stuff to wrap. Xmas comes, my stuff wasn't wrapped, it was still in the store bag.I got a lotion set for a teen girl, a vest 3 sizes too big, and 2 identical purses in different colors, 1had a busted zipper, they smell like plastic and not something I'd buy. It looked like he walked into the store, last minute, and grabbed whatever was in the 'return to shelf' cart. I said thank you and told him I love him. I didnt get upset until Saturday. He was going to his aunt's b-day party, I stayed home (w the flu) but I asked what he got her... he goes to the car and got a huge beautiful gift bag. Inside, was a designer purse. I lost it. Not bc it was nicer than what I got but because he really put thought into it. It was her fav color and designer... When I asked why he put so much effort into her gift but not mine, he said 'omg, I spent hundreds of dollars on you' That's not true, he left the receipt in the bag w the purses. Price isnt important to me (so why lie?). I have purses that were $5 that I absolutely love. We got in an argument and he left w/out his aunt's gift. I took my gifts and the 1 for her and put them in his closet. I dont want them. The next day, he said I could have the designer purse, then got mad bc I didnt want it. I wanted a gift that he put a bit of effort into. He admitted he didnt think I'd like the purses and that he was in a hurry. After 22 years, he knows that a hand written letter or a new clock (I collect them) would have been cherished forever. He says I'm mad about the money but I think it's about effort.

WIBTA if I buy my girlfriend a cheap engagement ring?,15597,Not the A-hole,1530,cynajq,1567449084.0,"I guess it goes without saying that I am proposing, but I should mention my girlfriend doesn't know I will be. I picked out a ring I think she'll like. She never wears rings and isn't a massive fan of diamonds. So I found a really nice gold one with an emerald that's surrounding by small diamonds. She loves green and gold jewellery, and I spent a long time finding this one. It's a created emerald which I think she'll prefer because she definitely wouldn't want any sort of conflict jewels. 

The ring is cheap. It was £300 and has actually gone down to £180. I mentioned this to my sister who said I was a dick, essentially. Apparently, she'll be showing it to her friends (some of whom are engaged), who will know about rings and clarity and such. She says they will see that it's cheap and it will be embarrassing for her. I'm 90% sure my girlfriend doesn't know much about jewellery and clarity.

I could probably get a similar ring that's more expensive. I certainly wouldn't know why I'm paying more, I don't think she would either. However, I am starting a new job soon and was going to buy a new TV for £250. I kind of realised I'm willing to spend more on myself for a random treat yourself present than an engagement ring and I started understanding my sister's perspective a bit more. So WIBTA?

AITA for not helping my coworker move after I showed up and no one was ready for the move and they started to belittle me over my life choices.,15607,Not the A-hole,803,h8etl5,1592107938.0,"This happened this morning.  I agreed to help a work buddy to move since I had a large truck and a trailer that I could use.  The plan was simple, I would show up around 6:30-6:45 AM.  And we would start with the large stuff (couch, beds, ect) and file any open space left with the packing boxes.  So well not everything had to be packed and ready to go (They were still living in the house so you need access to some stuff) I told them to have at least 70-80% of it ready and the his wife and kids can pack the rest for when we were traveling to the new place about 50 minutes away. He agreed to pay for the gas, breakfast, and lunch, I agreed to be the driver and mover. 

Well I show up at 6:38 on and give them a call. No pickup.  So I go up to the room which is on the 3rd floor, knock on the door and no answer.  So I try the phone again, and after checking that I have the right address (I don't want to wake the wrong person up) I try the door again.  One of the kids opens up and I am relived to that I have the right place.  I enter and find that a small pile of boxes on the wall, and a large amount of junk just tossed around the room. I ask to make sure that everything is packed. I get some attitude from her about how she has kids and I don't, so I need to shut up about it. Buddy shows up, and joins her, and I get about a dozen or so bingos about my life choices and how I need to help them out more since they have kids and I don't, and I can start with buying everyone breakfast and helping pack the boxes.  After about 20 minutes of this, I just left and went home. I have about 100 missed calls and texts right now from them, and have no real motivation to return and help them out.
______________________
Edit:  I started to read though the texts after cooling off a bit and reading your replies.  I have gotten half apologies, blaming a hangover, and that they were joking about breakfast, and asking what are they going to do without my help? So far I have not responded, but I think my only response should be is ""Rent a truck""
______________________
Edit 2:  Thank you every one, this is going to be my last response for the day (did I mention I got up at 4 am to get everything ready and to leave at 6am to be there on time?) So I am going to get ready for bed soon.   A few updates

-I did call my/his supervisor and gave him a dry rundown on what happened, that they were not ready to move, and to ask if they needed me to come in for the day since I was only 5 minutes away, I texted the other 2 managers to make sure as well, I am a jack of all trades guy and can cover for everyone, but if they think I am busy with Buddy's move they won't call me, and I am always happy for some overtime cash when I am already in the area.  I picked up some Hardees and went home and killed some digital ninjas with the all clear response. 

-It seems that they are using the kids phones to text and harasser me as well (I think they are the kids numbers, since they are not in my caller ID all I see is the phone number and provider), I have muted all the conversations, but I am keeping a record of them. 

-Buddy was given a 3 day weekend just for this move, so I will not know more until Tuesday. I am actually covering his shift for this on Monday. (normally I only work 4x 12-16 hour days a week)

______________________
**UPDATE**
I'm Back, way later than I wanted to be, but I have a some updates, and a few clarifications

-Tuesday came and past, I did get an apology and Buddy asked if I could help them again, my answer was nope, and I continued to work 16 hour days for the rest of the week.

-Buddy's wife decided to go the facebook route, it did not work in her favor, she deleted the post, the whole office knows now. 

They were supposed to be out by Friday, I have been working non-stop since then today was a half day (as I only worked 9 hours today) Next Monday will be my first day off this week.  As far as I know, no one in the office will help them.  They had to rent a truck, and I got a text message, asking me to please help them on Thursday, I did not respond. 

My favors to my co-workers almost always involve me getting paid more, as it is mostly me covering shifts. I am supposed to only work 4 days a week, but lately it has been way more. Most of management is on my side, and they do not give me any grief over my decisions. 

What is a ""BINGO""  Basically when someone complains on how you live your life.  It can be a bunch of different things, but in my case, mainly because I am gay and childfree. 

**Reasons why I though I maybe the ass hole**

-I was just raised that if you agree to do something, you follow though no matter what. 

-The 20 minutes of belittling, may have been closer to 7, I was in the apartment for only about 15 minutes before I left and I spent a good 5 minutes trying to get the door to open.

-When I did leave, I did say I was going to get breakfast, I did not saw I was only getting it for myself.

My husband and I have a son. He's just turned five. The early years were the normal struggle of trying to teach basic human functioning to a kid, but now it's become so fun! During this time there were definitely  low points, when he wouldn't sleep, juggling work and childcare, potty training, etc. There were quite some bad days, but my husband and I got through them and my brother in law and his wife have never been asked to help. Whatever their plans are at home or out, we have never asked them to change their plans or watch our kids.


Recently they had their own child and are going through the newborn stage. Sis in law is on maternity leave and brother in law is working. So a few days ago, I pick up my son from school and we come home before going to a highly anticipated trip to the movies. When we get home, sister is in the living room in tears. It seems her newborn didn't sleep much and has been colicky all day. I sympathise with her and tell her that this stage will be over soon.Then my son and I leave for the movie.


Today my husband told me that both my brother in law and his wife are angry that I didn't offer to take care of the baby for a while so she could have a break. I'm kind of shocked that I'm being asked to do something that they never have offered to do and we have never asked them to do. I feel like they should take care of their kid just like we did.

My wife told me to pick my daughter and Anna up from school, get them something to eat, and take them to dance.

I pick them up from school and ask where they want to go to eat. My daughter asks to go to this noodle place we go to sometimes, and I ask Anna if she would like that and she says sure, so we go. We all order and start eating, when suddenly Anna looks distressed and said she thinks she is having an allergic reaction. I ask her if she has allergies and she says she does to peanuts... and I look in her dish and it's clearly a peanut sauce.

I rush her to the hospital (we were pretty close so it was quicker than 911 would have been), and everything ended up being ok. I felt horrible. I call my wife when Anna is in the hospital room, but there is no answer and I do not have Anna's mother's phone number. So after Anna is given the all clear I immediately take her back to her house and explain what happened to her mother.

Her mother is furious, saying that I could have killed her child. I said back that she should have told me about her daughter's anaphylaxis, why would I assume something like that. She responded that you always ask about a child's allergies before getting them food. She also said that she didn't know I would be getting them dinner (School ends at 4 and dance isn't until 6, so I thought it would be safe to assume I would be giving them food..) I apologized for what happened, but still feel like Anna's mother definitely should have let me know in this situation, and also Anna is old enough to be aware of her anaphylaxis.

At the beginning, I went along with it, told her how cool it would be, we talked about if I would go with her, how crappy our current country is (I’m an expat and she’s a local), etc etc 

Recently, however, every few times she mentions it, I’ll bring up her spending habits. In the time we’ve been together, she’s spent around 8,000USD+ of her own money (plus her credit cards) on a few high ticket items. 

The last time she brought it up we sat down and calculated how much money she’d need to save to get started. 

After we had the number, I started calculating something else. Balenciaga shoes + LV bag + Gucci sunglasses etc etc until we came up with the number she needed to move and told her it’s never going to happen if she keep buying expensive things 

She’s called me TA, that I’m trying to control her money, I’m trying to humiliate her, make her feel “small” and it’s none of my business what she buys, and of course all of her friends are saying the same thing

WIBTA if i failed a Juniors probation period because he's reported me several times to the bosses?,15751,Not the A-hole,1034,hijfi8,1593535138.0,"This is a weird one.

I work in a digital agency, we hired a 19 year old to pick up and learn how our business works for our digital sector. I'm the manager of the digital department, i have a team of about 8 members, we're a close group as most of us have been working together for over 5 years. I've been here for 8 and i've been with the company since it was only 6 of us. We're now a business of over 70 people.

This 19 y/o that we hired is a big clients son. My boss who is good friends with the client offered him the job (subject to probation period) without us posting anything online for people to apply. I am the one that trains him up and i will be the one to approve his probation period, but i'm not sure if hes aware of that as my boss is the one that hired him.

This 19y/o was meant to start in March but then lockdown hit so we pushed it back a month, we thrived during the lockdown and thus needed more resource, so we took him on in April - It was challenging training someone through Microsoft Teams but he was picking up things very quickly, i'd say that we spent a good 2 hours a day on a call together. We got on pretty well and i liked him.

After the first 2 months, he was fitting in well and it was all good. Our digital department had a quiz night a few days before we were planning on coming back into the office. Since a lot of the digital guys  know my partner, i invited my partner to the quiz. I'm guessing that the new Junior didn't know i was gay as i'm considered very ""straight passing"". The quiz went well and we all had a laugh.

Now, last week we were in the office and i immediately got pulled into the the HR's room. I know most of the HR people well and some of us are friends outside of work. ""Someone"" had reported me of trying to make a pass at them on Microsoft Teams meetings. They were time stamped and its very clear that it was the Junior. I told them that nothing at all happened and i didn't make a pass at all (The HR lady knows me well, and knows i'm not into anyone younger than me at all). It was kind of left at that.

Yesterday, i got called into the HR office again, this time i was reported for the same thing but i was also reported for leaving the office early on friday (half hour early, but i confirmed with my boss before hand). I'm now under investigation for sexual harassment, although my HR representative said i shouldn't worry as she doesn't think anything will come of it since i literally haven't done anything.

Now, i'm not meant to know who this person is but i know 100% that its the Junior who is reporting me (my HR friend heavily hinted to me). This is his last week of probation, a lot of the digital guys aren't fond of him, and i can fail his probation based on ""Failure to work collaboratively"" but he's a pretty good worker. I'm not worried about the sexual harassment investigation since i have nothing to hide.

WIBTA for terminating his probation?

**EDIT:**

A colleague has found the Juniors twitter (same username as his instagram and same dp) where he has stated multiple homophobic tweets - one that was posted a week ago that seems possibly directed at.about me. This has gone into my document which i will be showing to my boss on Thursday, i have asked for the HR rep that is handling the case to join.

I'm feeling a lot better about this situation and feel like it will work out for the best for me.

So the title is stupid, i apologise for that, it definitely makes it seem like i'm failing him purely based on him going against me. Terribly worded.

I have a high paying job as an attorney and I'm currently moving to another state to start my own firm. 

My husband passed away 4 months ago. It wasn't a pretty end to our marriage as I had just found out that he was cheating on me with one of the waitresses working for his restaurant. They had been having an affair which went on for 3 years. He told me he didn't love me anymore and left to be with her. He passed away due to a sudden cardiac arrest after 2 weeks of leaving our marital home. We weren't legally separated. It wasn't official. 

As his wife, I inherited everything, including the restaurant as he started the restaurant after we got married. My parents helped him financially and I supported him after I got my first job. 

After finding out about his infidelity, I had no interest in keeping the restaurant. It was doing really well, but I needed a fresh start. 

My husband was emotionally attached to his restaurant and wanted his kids to take over after he died. He wanted it to be  a family enterprise. 

I didn't want any part of that. I made the decision to move to another state for better prospects, and decided to sell the restaurant. 

2 days before I made my final move to sell it, his mistress showed up to my home begging me to not sell the restaurant because she was pregnant. She wanted her unborn child to take over the restaurant. She said that the child was morally entitled to the restaurant as his unborn child. 

I simply asked her to leave and went ahead with my decision.

I figured they did this because they didn't want anyone booking next to them, but they were the only seats left so I booked the window for myself and the aisle seat for my girlfriend. 


When we boarded the guy openly admits to booking the middle seat just so nobody would want to book seats next to someone sitting alone, he even stated that it usually works and he’s very proud of it. Then he asked if I could give up my window seat to get to sit next to my girlfriend. I was admittedly a little upset that he openly admit to just taking the middle seat so nobody would sit next to him. I honestly didn't want to give up my window seat and my girlfriend didn't want to give up her aisle seat since that's what we both like. So we denied him, and he just comes at us with, ""you really don't want to sit next to your boyfriend or girlfriend, do you guys hate each other that much?"" I answered, ""no, we just really don't want to reward you for booking your seat like a dick.""


As I said my girlfriend said I was a little harsh and we could have switched seats, yeah it would have been nice to sit next to my girlfriend, but at the time she didn't want to sit next to me either.

AITA for wanting my husband to start paying more for our housing?,15463,Not the A-hole,4358,f9tgvs,1582753706.0,"Hi all. For reference, I am 29f and my husband is 30m. We’ve been together since I was 20, and got married when I was 26. When we moved in together when I was 25, we were splitting our rent evenly. I was making 65k and he was making 80k, and we live in a large US city. It didn’t really make a huge difference in my budget vs his to split rent 50/50 for 2600 a month rent.

However, things have changed. I got pregnant a few months after we go married (which we were so happy about and wanted). I didn’t want to not work, but I wanted to be home with our baby, so I found a full time remote job in my field of work. The downside is I took a cut to my salary from 65k to 50k. We continued to split rent in our apartment.

My husband, between being 26 and 30, has received a number of raises and has switched his job. He is now a senior business analyst, making roughly 195k a year. Since we were having a child, we were going to need a bigger apartment. We found a 3 bedroom for 4000k per month. He still wanted to split rent evenly, despite my protests, and despite me wanted to try to find a smaller apartment for less. In the end, I sort of let myself get walked over because he really is such a smooth talker and I do love him.

Anyway, flash forward 2.5 years, our rent has increased to 4400k. My take home pay monthly after taxes is roughly 3600k. I am paying 2.2k monthly in rent. I am also taking care of our baby and our home, doing chores, and cooking daily. My husband works from 8 - 6, but typically doesn’t get home until 7. I am burnt out. I barely have enough money per month to do things I enjoy. I feel like I am financially struggling while my husband is living a life of luxury. Yes he does take me out on dates and on vacation, but he doesn’t seem to understand that this is not enough for me.

I spoke to him two days ago very seriously, and when I asked about trying to split rent based on our income and pay an equal percentage of our income so that it is more fair than fully equal. His reaction stunned me. He asked me why having 1.6k extra a month wasn’t enough for me. I told him I’m not saving anything. He told me I should spend less on extracurricular activities - which makes me laugh because what extracurricular activities? All I do is work, cook, clean, shop for the house and raise our child. I told him I am basically working two full time jobs at once and I need help. Then he asked me if I am suggesting he pay me for being a mother and that stunned me - I really had no response to that.

Anyway, he told me that this is the lifestyle we agreed when we moved in together way back when. However, he doesn’t seem to understand, or rather does not want to understand.

Now he is mad with me because he thinks I am being selfish and has been acting cold to me these past few days. I am getting the itch to apologize and take it back like I always do, but I really feel I am right here.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: Thank you all for all of the responses. I can honestly say I did not expect to get this feedback. 

I am honestly overwhelmed and cannot reply to all of you, especially while I am working but I wanted to update some things here.

I love my husband with all my heart, and it is heartbreaking for me to read these comments and realize that I am being taken advantage of. I need to figure out the best way to approach this issue and solve it before it gets too far. I want to work this out and the fear of being alone is haunting me.

Yes I did sign a prenup that was overseen by his family attorney. My husband comes from extreme wealth and I was young and stupid and went with it. Head over heels like my mother always said I was.

As for his family - we get along great and they love me. It’s very confusing because they are such incredibly generous people, and they are family. But they don’t know about our financial situation because my husband and I believe that our marriage is private. And I would feel like I was betraying him by telling them.

I’m sorry I cannot reply to all of you, but please know I am reading all of the comments and making of plan of approach with them.

EDIT 2: for those talking about the dates and vacations bit that he pays for - I have asked him numerous times to help lighten my financial load instead of going on these trips and dates and he has refused. He said he can do what he wants with his money and if he wants to take us on vacation that is what he will pay for. If I could afford vacation I would pay. In fact, when we were in a more even financial situation, unmarried, not kids - I paid for almost ALL of our vacations and dates because I love to treat people. And I can’t do that anymore.

EDIT 3: I also DO NOT have bad spending habits. I worked my way out of my student loan debt in two years after graduating. I saved 60k but the time we got married, and I have that all in my retirement which I am thankful for because I can no longer contribute to it. This has NOTHING to do with how I spend. I am actually pretty frugal when it comes to shopping, especially since I prefer to keep things cheap for my budget.",False,1582746008.0,2020-02-26 13:48:26
AITA for booting my mom & her negative attitude from the hospital room after my daughter was born?,15457,Not the A-hole,1188,eon6gr,1579046602.0,"Settle in, this'll be a long one...

New 1st time dad here to a healthy little princess born this past Thursday. Unfortunately, the joy my wife & I felt in this scenario was temporarily halted by my mother's wholly inappropriate behavior that I'm just not ok with.

Some background: my mom has always been one of those people with a massive victim complex. People she knows go out to dinner & don't invite her? Must have been intentional. A decision is made without getting her input? Must have been done on purpose to spite her. You get the idea. 

This behavior manifested heavily 5 years ago when we got married and became a sore point for a long time. Once she found out we were expecting, again the negative behaviors came out. 

Tired of her leaving a stain on every moment that should be joyous, I finally had a sitdown with her. I told her in no uncertain terms that I wasn't going to raise my daughter in a negative environment like this, that we want her to be around and involved but her attitude needs to change. I was polite but firm about all of this. She resisted at first, resorting to her usual ways & thinking I was just plotting to get away from her completely, but in the end she claimed to have understood where I was coming from and promised to try and change her tone.

Well, the big day arrives and everyone is at the hospital. Baby is born, we had some bonding time as a family, then invited the grandparents (both sides) up to meet her. On arrival we introduced her and shared her name (we'd elected to keep it a secret). My wife and I come from different religious backgrounds and thus different naming traditions. Mine is to name after a departed loved one, hers is to name after a living relative. So our compromise was to name her after my grandmother (mom's mom) who passed a while ago and make the middle name for her mom, our daughter's grand mother.

After being in the room a bit and meeting her the question inevitably comes up of how we came up with her name. So I explain and at first she's beaming that her granddaughter is named for her mother, then when we get to the middle name her face changes to a look of pure anger and she says YOU DID WHAT?!? I calmly explain again, only to get OK, folded arms and a pouting demeanor clearly displaying her disapproval at this choice. This is supposed to be a happy occasion and I finally decided enough was enough and told her it was time to go. This lead to resistance from my dad, her going off the rails again about how everything is against her, and my wife hysterical that another even has been messed up. So I told my dad flat out that this behavior is the reason why and I won't have my kid around it, that when she's ready to behave like the grandmother we want our daughter around she can return but for today we're through. Apparently according to any and all in my family I'm the asshole for stepping in this way.

I don't think I did anything wrong here, but I leave that decision up to you guys. TIA",False,False,2020-01-14 16:03:22

Basically I [20M] recently started a job where I have mostly female coworkers. Amongst them is a small group who all have young kids around the same age. They go to mum-and-kid activities together, babysit each other's kids, have coffee mornings, hang out at the weekends etc. There is one coworker who has  complained to me a few times that she feels deliberately left out by this group. She refers to herself as ""mama"" and often talks about ""the kids"", so I assumed she had children of her own and sympathised with her that she was being excluded from the mummy group. However, Friday I asked to see a picture of the kids...and she showed me a photo of three cats. Quickly dawned on me that she's a fur mama with fur babies, which I get bc I love my animals too, but it made it weird to me that she's pissed about being excluded from activities involving actual human children when she has none herself. When she later complained again about not being invited to something I kinda gently said ""maybe it's cause they're hanging out with their kids, I don't know if fur babies really count in that context"". Coworker got upset and ran out crying. 

Turns out, she's infertile and desperately wants kids but can't have them, so her considering her cats as her kids is how she copes. Obviously I feel *awful* now, I didn't mean to insult her or invalidate her feelings like that. Still I'm saved a little by the fact that I didn't know, right?

I have a child with my ex from whom I recently split. We're on good terms though, and he doesn't have family where we live, so he's been coming to all my family's holiday events.

My father wanted to move here for more opportunities, and my mother, being a devoted housewife moved along with him. In my homeland's culture, women don't work once they're married and my mother married straight out of High School so she'd never had a job before.

My parents had me here, and when I was 8, my father passed away from cancer. My mother could have taken the easy route, she could have moved back to her homeland where relatives would look after us. But instead, she chose to get several jobs here (for cash so no benefits, no one was willing to have a middle aged foreigner that speaks little english work for them legitimately) and work hard to raise me in the US. If she'd gone home, I would probably have had to work on a farm till I died, but because of her, I got to have an education and have a well-paying office job. 

Since my mother had no benefits at her various jobs, I've always known it would be my duty to look after her in her old age. I've always been very upfront about everyone I've been in a relationship with, that my mother is a part of the package. That until she dies, I'll be paying for her bills, rent and some money for her to spend. My husband agreed to this when we started dating, and after we got married. 

But with corona, he got laid off, and we've been living off my income. I make quite a bit more than him, so we're still living solidly middle class lives, it's just that we don't have excess fun money anymore for hobbies till he gets another job. Obviously, my mother also is only receiving what she needs to get by too.

And now that it's affecting him, he's been making snide comments about my mother being a freeloader, and that she's still young enough to be working (she's in her late 60s). I told him to cut it out, that he knew what he was signing up for when he married me, so unless he wants to leave me, this is how it's going to be.

I didn't say the dreaded D word, but implying it was enough he stormed out. I got a few messages from my SIL and BIL about how I was being ridiculous expecting my husband to be second fiddle to my mother.

AITA for not explicitly correcting my child's language?,15387,Not the A-hole,1454,fba0io,1582996050.0,"I am from a small non-English speaking country, but my partner is American and we live in the US. We have a five-year-old daughter who is in kindergarten this year. I almost always speak to my child in my native language. It's important to me that she learns my native language.

We've taken the approach of ""Don't explicitly correct when Daughter confuses the languages"". For example, if she says ""I want Mëllech"" instead of ""I want milk"", we ask ""Oh, do you want milk?"" instead of ""Not Mëllech, milk."" She doesn't get words confused as much anymore, but it does still happen.

Last week, she came home from school and has absolutely refused to speak anything but English, and was much, much quieter than normal. If I spoke to her in my native language, she would respond in English. I tried to read a book with her, and she started crying. I asked her why, and she said that she ""had to speak English"". After some more coaxing, she told me her teacher had told her she could only speak English because my language had ""naughty words"" and punished her by taking away recess.

I was furious, but I talked to her teacher the next day. She told me that my daughter was cursing in class and I needed to talk to her about appropriate language. I asked what words she was saying exactly, and was told ""ass"". Now, ""ass"" is ""is"" in my native language, and is pronounced more like ""ahs"" than the English word. I figured out that my daughter was switching ""ass"" and ""is"", and the teacher thought she was swearing at everybody.

I explained what I thought was happening to the teacher, and explained how to correct Daughter, and said that we would be more vigilant at home. The teacher absolutely refused and insisted that I stop speaking to Daughter in my native language because it was obviously confusing her and affecting her English ability. I told her nevermind and that she should leave all correction to to me and my husband, and that if I heard anything more from my daughter, I would be filing a complaint with the principal. She had no right to tell me how to raise my child, and to make my child cry for mixing up a word.

I was telling my friend about the incident, and she says that I made too much of a scene. I shouldn't threaten the teacher for trying to correct my daughter. But we've tried very hard to make both languages equal for my daughter, and now that work was undone by someone who apparently can't understand that a young child will mix up words sometimes. But I admit I was very angry in the moment and maybe wasn't thinking as I would if I was calm.

Am I the asshole here?

Edit: Thank you everyone for the kind words. I am definitely continuing to teach my daughter my language. That was never up for debate. I was just wondering if I had been too harsh with the teacher.

My sister is 19, four years younger than me, and she became pregnant unexpectedly with her boyfriend of only three months. She’s way too young for a kid, and that shows in a multitude of ways, but none so egregious as her name announcement.

She posted on Facebook yesterday a calligraphy banner with “Anakin Skywalker *last name*” printed on it.

I put a laugh react because obviously I thought it was a joke? But then later when I called her to ask for the real name she said “no, that’s exactly what we’ve decided to call him.” I asked how the BD felt about it and she said “well I’m carrying the baby for nine months and pushing it out of MY body so I get name privileges.” Wtf.

I said dude, you know this kid is going to be abysmally bullied, right? You’re giving him a name that is fully entrenched in pop culture. It’s not a name that he can fit to his own identity, he’s going to be known as Darth Vader his whole fucking life. I then said I didn’t even know my sister was a Star Wars fan.

She responded “It’s not about Star Wars at all, just really love the name Anakin Skywalker, it has good sonics (???). I’m sure people won’t care if he’s called Anakin.”

I started laughing and told her she’s an idiot for not seeing the problem here, and she got really really mad. She hung up on me and evidently called my parents because they FaceTimed me later and while dad thought it was an absolute riot, mom told me off for not being “gentle with my sister during a difficult time”.

So I never knew my biological dad. He and mum weren't serious and she doesn't like to talk about him, I don't even know his name. However, when I was 5 she married my stepdad and he was great! He had two kids (twins, 6 years older than me) already himself and he never treated me any different from them. Like, he literally got himself, his other son and me matching team jumpers with our names on for when we go to the rugby. Then, last year, him and mum got divorced. I've not been findng it super easy, especially since mum has a new partner now and he isn't as nice to me as my stepdad was, but I'm okay. 

Here's the issue though. For the 9 years they were married I called my stepdad ""Dad"". Like, if people asked me or I was talking about him I'd say my stepdad, but if I was addressing him directly I'd call him Dad, if that makes any sense at all. I haven't stopped doing it since they got divorced. I've been sleeping over at his house every other weekend, and seeing him sometimes on other days to do activities and things. Keep calling him dad. I will admit us hanging out has kind of been tapering off, though. 

Anyway, my big sister offered me a lift to school this morning. She told me when we were in the car that I should stop being so attached to Dad and that I should even stop calling him Dad. I asked why, and she said that he isn't my real dad. I told her I know that but he's been my dad for the last decade.

AITA for legally suspending my daughter's license?,15365,Not the A-hole,4454,en0zfr,1578736405.0,"My daughter is 16. Myself and her mom separated when she was 12, and we both live in the same town and maintain a healthy relationship, and split custody 50/50. I taught my daughter how to drive, and was with her when she got her license last month. Last week, my daughter came home with a ticket for texting and driving on the highway. This caused a huge concern for me. The ticket included a $200 fine and a 20 day suspension of her license.

I was obviously very upset and we got into an argument about it. Her points were that ""everyone does it"" and that she doesn't do that often, or when other cars are around. Not only was she defending herself, but she was essentially arguing that she does it safely. I told her that regardless of when the suspension kicks in, she is grounded from driving until she has shown that she can be responsible enough to not put her own life, or the other lives on the road, in danger. I took her car keys (a car that I had bought for her as a getting-your-license present).

She went and called her mom before I did, and next thing I know, I have her calling me and telling me that I had no right to punish her like that without talking to her first. I agreed that I should have talked to her first about it, but that I feel like the grounding is nonnegotiable. Her mom actually took her side, and said the same ""everyone does it"" bullshit, and that she needs a car to get to work and hang out with friends. I told her that it is ridiculous that she is even supporting this. The conversation ended with her telling me that she wasn't going to enforce the rule, and would allow her to drive one of her cars at her house.

I waited a few days, until it was her mom's turn of custody. I called her and she confirmed that she isn't backing off, and that she is going to let her drive until the suspension kicks in. I told her that she is actively letting our child endanger her life as well as everyone else's. She told me I am making this a much bigger deal out than it needs to be, and she said that if it was actually that serious, she would have gotten more than a 20 day suspension.

In my state, the parent that signed the minor-driving consent form when you get your license has the ability to have your license revoked, so I did just that. They warned me that this will count as a full revocation on her record, and that she will be ineligible to get it again until she is 18. I went through with it and texted her mother to tell her that I revoked her license, and sent her a picture of the paper the DMV sent me. She told me I am out of line and making decisions for our daughter without consulting her.

I also decided to get a upper end luxury car which was a huge upgrade from my old but reliable Volvo since I figured I'd earned it and I could pay for it outright.

I took my boyfriend with me to the dealership as you do as a couple. 

A salesman approached us and the entire time, from the start to finish, kept talking to my boyfriend even though I clearly introduced myself and told him the car was for me and that I would be paying outright for it.

My boyfriend was off put by thing and kept referring the salesman to me when he asked my boyfriend a question and even pointedly said at some point "" I don't know, it's Delicious\_Cancel's car, ask her"".

The salesmen would then look at me, I'd answer and then the next question, back to my boyfriend. 

The only question I was asked was around colour preference and leather vs fabric interior. 

I was kind of internally fuming at this point. The final straw was after the test drive (of course he gave the keys to my BF), I said that I really liked the guy and he turned to my BF and asked if he should get the paperwork ready.

I interjected and said I wanted to think about it. I had already decided on the car but I didn't want to commission to go to him. My boyfriend could tell I was a bit upset about this interaction and offered to go to another dealership with me tomorrow or leave a review or something.

So we left and came back the next morning, a different salesperson greeted us and this one was much better, ridiculously charming, flattered me by saying a hard working woman like me deserved a good car and all the flattery I was expecting when being sold to. 

I told him we'd driven the car yesterday and decided to buy it and we did, no hassles. I even managed to negotiate some extras since I told him I was giving him a sale for very little effort on his part.

I was recounting this story to a friend of mine yesterday who is sales (but in IT) told me I was a bit of an asshole because the previous salesman had done all the work and I gave the sale to someone else when I was wanting to buy the car anyway. 

He said I should have asserted myself a bit more on the spot and given the previous salesman more of a chance rather than try to screw him over behind his back because now he'd never know why he'd lost the sales. He also said that sales was a tough job and maybe old habits die hard. Or if I didn't want to buy from him at all, I should have given him a concrete reason so he could learn.

I think my thing is, it's 2020 and it's basic sales 101 to speak to the person who holds the purse-strings. Also it's not my job to teach a saleperson anything, I just want to have a smooth experience buying a car.

This is a topic we’ve been debating for the past almost two years now. It’d be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. 

My perspective (husband):

My wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache. About two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, I probably ate something delicious. 

After eating something delicious, I can’t quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. I’m talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. 

Over the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  I didn’t want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. 

Once they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. That with a couple Excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife’s contractions started to pick up. 

Am I the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?

Wife’s perspective:

My husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. It kept getting worse, and every time he’d complain I’d say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. 

So as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn’t in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. 

I did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. 

I’d like to also mention it wasn’t just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. 

He is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?",False,False,2019-07-23 20:57:32
AITA for telling my parents I have no plans to be involved in my unborn siblings life and I think they are wrong for having another kid at their age?,15349,Not the A-hole,3070,gt22oh,1590817791.0,"I'm a 21 year old college student currently stuck at home due to a viral pandemic. Both me and my sister (19 years old) moved back in when our dorms closed and plan to leave back for school in the fall (if the colleges re-opens).

The problem here comes from the fact that this week our parents (mom is 45 and dad is 53) decided to drop on us that mom is 3 months pregnant. Suffice to say, this situation is strange. I didn't dare ask but my guess is this is a ""whoopsie"" child. The thing that really caused issue though was not only are they planning on carrying the kid to term, they have slowly started hinting over the week that they expect me and my sister to stay nearby and ""be a brother and sister"" and help them out with this kid.

Ignoring the fact that my parents are already past middle age, this will not work at all. I graduate next year and am most likely moving to the other side of the US or even out of the country (I interned last summer in Germany and plan to apply to the company there). The same applies for my sister as she want's to move to France and work there. Both of my parents know this, yet as I've talked about htis over the week they seem like they think me and my sister need to stay close so we can be a ""family"".

Last night this kinda came to a head. My dad started talking to me about my plans after college and told me about businesses nearby that I could apply too. I told him that I had no intent to work here because the money I could make in other places is much better. We talked about this for a while before he dropped ""you know it will be hard for you too be a good big brother if you live so far away right?"". This was the last straw for me honestly and I bluntly told him that I really didn't care and I had no real intent to be in the kids life.

This was the wrong thing to say. Me and him started arguing and eventually my mom and sister got pulled in. I told my parents that it's incredibly selfish of them to not only expect me and my sister to drop our plans for them and this kid, but to also bring a kid into this world and raise it at their ages. My mom broke down at this and my dad started yelling claiming that i'm extremely selfish and childish and that I am horrible for shaming them like this.

They've been avoiding me since the fight outside of my mom crying to me today about how much i'm hurting them. I just got a call from my aunt calling me all sorts of names including asshole. She says that I am causing my mom and dad a ton of stress and that I owe it to them to be there for my sibling

I don't know how i'm in the wrong here. I'm an adult. This is the first time i've lived at home in 2 years and I have my own life ahead of me. How am I the asshole for just stating facts and not wanting to drop everything and plan around what I think is a mistake.

Edit:

Since there's nearly 2 k comments and I'm not gonna stay up past midnight responding to everyone I'll just put here some stuff most people want to know along with just my personal take away. 

On the topic of why I said what I said. 

My relationship with my father is complicated, to much so for me to even get into it here. But, my father has a mind set that he is ""Too old"" to do certain things. And will use this card to try to guilt me and my sister into doing things. This, along with a multitude of other personal reasons that have nothing to do with this post is the reason I decided to not come back until a virus that has shut down many parts of the world forced me home. 

This is part of why I used their ages in my argument. I don't have anything against older parents, I just believed my parents are in a place in their lives where having a child would be a bad idea. Was this wrong of me? Probably. Will I apologize for it? Yes. 

However, I stand by what I said originally. I believe that my parents intentions were to have me and my sister take responsibility in some way for this child. There are reasons why I believe this that again go into my relationship with them. This is why I reacted the way I did, because I believe they want to use me and my sister to co-raise this child. I stand by my statement about not wanting to be involved as a ""big brother"" and accept any judgement that brings 

This is something I've replied to a lot of people with already, but just put it here for anyone else coming in. Thanks for all the opinions on this matter. Was good seeing other points of view. Gave me some clarity on the matter.",False,1590815287.0,2020-05-29 22:49:51
Update: AITA for telling my son the truth about his mother?,15325,UPDATE,393,es3p8q,1579680823.0,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ekicbi/aita_for_telling_my_7_year_old_the_truth_about/

Brief Recap: I am a single dad to a 7 year old boy. His mother has struggled with drug addiction and hasn't been in his life since he was an infant. When he asked about his mom in the past I would just tell him that she wasn't able to take care of him the way he needed to be taken care of. He pushed for more information a couple weeks ago. He asked why he had to live with his grandmother before living with me. I told him, ""Because your mom and I weren't talking when she was pregnant with you. I didn't know she had you until your grandmother told me. After that I did everything I could to get you."" He asked if he would ever be able to see his mom again. I said, ""I don't know. I don't even know where she is. She has a sickness called addiction. Sometimes when people are sick like that they make decisions that no one understands. That doesn't mean she doesn't love you though."" He cried, I felt bad, and my mom told me I told him way too much information. I came here looking for judgement.

Update: I was overwhelmed by the amount of replies. I did get a lot of people calling it a validation post. I didn't mean for it to be but it was nice to see so many people say that I wasn't the asshole. It gave me some more confidence in my parenting. I don't know much about kids or parenting and am kind of learning on the fly here. Seeing his and my mom's reactions made me think I ruined my son's innocence. I have decided to get some parenting counseling for myself to help me navigate different challenges. For my son, I talked to him about joining a group for kids who have parents that struggle with addiction. We have a center here that does a weekly group session for kids. They separate it by grade so my son will be with about 10 kids around his age dealing with the same thing. The coordinator said the group has everyone from kids who have never met their drug addicted parent to kids who see their drug addicted parent everyday to kids who have lost parents to addiction. My son is very interested and I am glad he'll be able to see that he isn't the only kid dealing with this.

Thanks again to everyone who commented. I still don't know if I am doing the right thing but I am trying my hardest to raise a strong, happy, and healthy kid. I hope his mom gets to see him one day.",False,False,2020-01-22 00:13:43
AITA for refusing to change my accent and laughing in a classmate's face after she told me my accent is offensive?,15332,Not the A-hole,3510,fut9o5,1586033826.0,"A bit of a weird post but please bear with me.

I(19f) am from Germany and I also go to university there. Because of my major I have to take some advanced english classes, this incident happened about two months ago.

About three years ago I went to England for a month and I stayed with an english guest family there. Naturally all of them spoke with a heavy english accent and after a few weeks I started to adpot that accent.

It's normal for guest students to adopt a certain accent for the duration of their stay according to my guest family but what's weird is that my accent didn't go away after I returned to Germany. I have been speaking with an english accent ever since and it's pretty normal to me now but I still write and use American english words like ""color"" instead of ""colour"" and ""fries"" instead if ""chips"".

That was three years ago.

My english class at univerity last semester was pretty diverse with studenty from many different countries. One student was from England so naturally she also spoke with an english accent.

Our class included a lot of speaking exercises since the course was predominantely vistited by students whose second language is english.

During our last class of the semester one of my new friends (not the english girl my story is about) asked me why I speak with an english accent when I'm German. I shortly explained that I spent some time in England and that's why I speak the way I speak.

The english girl was sitting right next to me so she must've overheard. After class she pulled me aside and and told me how offensive she thinks my accent is because I'm not English so I shouldn't pretend that I am. She also called my accent ""borderline cultural appropriation"".

I was so confused in that moment that I just chuckled, said ""okay"" and walked away. I pretty much forgot about this incident afterwards until I checked the new entry list for the class and saw her name on it.

So AITA for speaking with an english accent even though I'm not english and laughing in the girl's face after she confronted me about it? I really don't know if it's an AH move of me to speak with an accent where I'm not from.

EDIT: A lot of comments don't really believe that my accent changed within only one month and accuse me of faking it to seem ""special"". I honestly don't know what to say except for yes, my accent is real and changed within that time span. I also didn't change the way I speak conciously, it just happened and I never even felt the desire to adopt an english accent or any other accent for that matter.

AITA for not letting my boyfriend’s best friends use my airline discount after saying they could?,15277,Not the A-hole,918,cfy0uu,1563737120.0,"Throwaway because all parties know my account name.

Backstory: My boyfriend (Alex\*) and I have been together for 4 years, I’ve become friends with his two best friends (James\* and Noah\*) but we’re not particularly close nor do we ever hang out without him. I work for an airline and one of the major perks is that I get discounts on flights that I can also use for family and friends. As I am in my first year with the company I only get a certain number of discount seats and I had 3 left for the year.

Situation: Alex asked me if I could use my discount to buy tickets for him and his two best friends. I happily agreed since he deserved a nice holiday. He booked his time off work and they made their plans. They were to send me the money and then I would put it all on my card just for simplicity.

Three nights ago Alex came home really upset. He told me his friends had decided to change the holiday dates, bringing them forward a week, because it clashed with a concert they wanted to go to. He was upset because he couldn’t move his holiday dates with work and when he told his friends they had decided to go without him because they had been looking forward to the gig for ages. I was pretty angry on his behalf especially since he had done most of the planning, including finding the hotel. To make up for I started planning a trip for me and him on his holiday dates.

James messaged me last night and said he would put the money in my account this morning. No ask if he could still use my discount, no explanation for what they had done, nothing. I was outraged that he would even suggest using my discount after fucking over my boyfriend. I sent him a polite but blunt message explaining that he and Noah were no longer able to use my discount on this holiday as I would be using the seats for me and Alex and that they were still welcome to use them on a holiday that involved my boyfriend in the future. He replied with a barrage of texts saying that I was being selfish and unfair as I had “promised” two seats to him and Noah and that they were using the money they were saving to go to the concert. He even phoned Alex to complain. Alex is torn. He thinks it’s a little unfair to let his friends down and doesn’t want this affecting the relationship between me and his friends so I should just give them the seats to keep the peace. I refused and was hurt that he was still taking sticking up for them.

Am I the asshole for going back on my word and choosing to use the seats for myself?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your support. I must admit I know this seems a bit like a validation post with all the NTA votes but I hate going back on my word and I guess I did feel a bit like an asshole just because I've known these guys 4 years and didn't want to make life hard for my boyfriend so I needed some honest opinions. This sub has shown me the light and I will be showing Alex this when I get home. He is a massive people pleaser and hates letting people down so that explains it but he's going to get a spine even if I have to grow it in a lab. I'm standing my ground and taking the trip myself. Any holiday suggestions?

2ND UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your votes and insights. It made me realise that even though most of you have voted me NTA, there are some things I hadn’t considered. I have spoken to Alex and shown him this thread (guess I don’t know why I used a throwaway) and he actually feels a lot better about speaking to them about it now. He apologised for making me feel bad for standing up for him when he didn’t stand up for himself and I apologised for not discussing my choice with him before I told his friends they can’t use my discount in the way that I did. He said he’s just going to let it play out but he’ll be willing to forgive them eventually. So for those wanting a final dramatic update, I don’t think we’ll be getting one.

AITA for telling my SO he'll need to limit gym time after baby?,15278,Not the A-hole,2789,d62kdo,1568862588.0,"I'm currently 6 weeks pregnant and have a 15 month old. This pregnancy is a surprise and honestly, I wasn't sure we should have another, because we had a rough go with our first. During the newborn phase, I was SO exhausted. I was breastfeeding, baby had colic, I was in pain with 3 2nd degree tears, etc. I do not easily fall asleep, so after waking up with the baby at night, it would typically take me another 30 minutes to fall back asleep, and I was roughly getting 2.5 hours of sleep a night for a good 3-5 weeks (it's all a blur now).

My husband had cut back his gym time once the baby was here, but was still going 3-5 times during the week. He would silently be ticked if I asked him to not go to the gym. I truly think he thought he was really pulling his own weight (he'd help with the bath, would feed her bottles, change diapers, etc.). But sometimes, that ""help"" wasn't enough. Sometimes, I NEEDED another adult to talk to and to lend me a hand in the evenings. Example: one Saturday I got up to pump. They were both awake (8:00am). He said he was going to head to the gym since I was awake, and I started crying saying ""please, can you let me sleep a little bit more- she was up all night and I got maybe three hours or so of sleep"" and he got pissed since he had already gotten up with her that morning and let me ""sleep in."" I told him that it must be nice to even have the ENERGY to go to the gym. The ONLY thing I wanted to be able to do was sleep. I got the response ""I'm sorry you hate being a mom!""

Now that I'm pregnant again, I mentioned to him ""if I thought the last time was really hard and overwhelming, how the hell am I supposed to get through it while also having a 23 month old?"" I told him this meant he was going to have to help out more and probably not go to the gym as much. Well, he did not receive this kindly. He texted me the next day ""Just to be clear, I feel like I do a lot. I will not be able to help out with daycare, as I drive a work truck and cannot have another passenger in my car. I will continue to go to the gym, because health is important to me and I need to go to relieve stress. The reason you're so stressed is because you choose to hold and entertain our daughter all the time, while I think it's ok to let her cry if she's bored. You need to think about if you want this baby. ""

I fucking lost it.

I said ""I cannot believe you would rather me have an abortion than make any more sacrifices regarding your gym time."" But he is adamant that I am the selfish one

If my husband got me lingerie, okay a little self serving but I wouldn’t mind that much. A friend? Weird.

AITA for telling my GF I do not want her sterilising her menstrual cup in our kettle?,15255,Not the A-hole,3394,eo33vy,1578945078.0,"My GF and I have been together for nearly 2 years now. We get along great and already have moved in with each other. I am a pretty laid back guy and like to ""go with the flow"", whilst she is very organised and likes to take charge, which works very well for us because we are always pulling in the same direction because our personalities match up well!

A couple of months or so ago we were having the conversation about women's sanitary products. We were discussing how expensive they are etc and we got onto the subject of ""menstrual cups"" (the ones where you can just keep reusing them, so it would save us so much money in the long run. My GF looked them up, we did some research and ordered one (specifically one called ""mooncup"")

It took my GF a while to get used to it, but by her second period she was accustomed to it; problem solved!

Now here is where the issue begins... I live in the UK and as many of you probably know, us Brits love a cup of tea... Whenever I make a cup of tea I always empty out the old water from the kettle, just so I can fill it up with fresh water and maximise the flavour. Yesterday I poured all the water out of the kettle to make myself a brew, and my GF's menstrual cup fell out of it!!

I was a bit shocked and called out to my GF (in the other room) ""Babe, why is your menstrual cup in the kettle?!""; 

To which she replied ""Oh I was boiling it to 'sterilise' it, to make sure it is clean for my next use, I thought you knew, this isn't the first time I have used the kettle to sterilise it""

I was lost for words and told her that is disgusting, we drink water from this kettle, who in their right mind would use it to boil something that collects blood from inside of you???

AITA for telling my ex I refuse to share custody of our daughter?,15241,Not the A-hole,3904,co0j4u,1565375527.0,"My ex an I have an incredibly long history. We met when I was 18 and he was 19. He was my first love and we dated about a year. But after the break up we continued an off and on again friends with benefits relationship until I turned 23. Which was also the same time I found out I was pregnant...

He was going to school to be a doctor and he was in his second year of getting his doctorates when I found out. He also was studying in another state that was on the other side of the country. I got pregnant during one of his visits back home. 

When I found out I was pregnant I told him immediately. He was very very angry and asked what I was going to do about it. I told him I’d be keeping it and he told me he wanted no part in the child’s life because it was going to ruin everything for him. I told him that wasn’t an option. 

I myself grew up with my birth father jumping in and out of the picture and it’s a big stem of my mental illnesses now. All things he knew.

After begging him to be in the baby’s life throughout almost my entire pregnancy one day he and his parents called me and offered me a deal. They offered to pay me a very hefty child support until the day the child turned 18 if I never forced him to be a real father. His parents (who are very wealthy) promised to take care of everything.

At first I said no. I refused and called them all assholes and told them my baby was gonna have a dad... but after talking to many of my friends and family they thought it best I take the offer. They told me there was no use in forcing him to be a shitty dad to my baby. I finally agreed about 8 months into my pregnancy.

I took sole custody of course. It’s been 7 years and I had a beautiful baby girl that I love more than anything on earth. Every single month I get a check and not once has it ever been late. I haven’t seen or talked to my ex since the day he handed me the first check. Until about a week ago. 

I get a call and it’s my ex. He tells me he wants to take joint custody of our daughter. The daughter he has never met in his or her life ever! I was infuriated and told him no. He told me that I can’t just say no because he’s gonna take me to court where a judge will decide. 

I was crying and screaming and asking why he was doing this. He told me he was sorry but he’s ready to be a father and he wants to be there for our daughter. When I told him I was going to fight him with every fiber of my being to make sure he got nothing he told me I was being ridiculous and I need to grow up. 

I’ve told my family and friends and almost all of them have told me I need to give him a chance and that I’m just being a bitch. The only person that agrees with me is my mother who watched me get torn apart by my fathers constant jumping in and out of my life when I was a child. I know that this is going to be a hard fight and ultimately it is the courts decision but I just feel like I need to fight this. AITA for being so against him getting any custody?

AITA for rubbing my belly?,15242,Not the A-hole,1763,hc4gta,1592615118.0,"I’m (28F) 6 months pregnant and the first in my family to be pregnant. My family has reacted weirdly towards my pregnancy so far, but this is a whole new level. I’m wondering if I’m TA or not.

Being this far along, I am constantly feeling the baby moving inside me. She presses on my bladder and makes a ruckus in there. I found that gently rubbing my belly up and down (over my clothes) “calms” her down and keeps her from jabbing my insides with her feet. 

Due to COVID I haven’t been able to see my parents until last weekend. So far I it’s just been me and my fiancé celebrating the pregnancy, so I was excited to show them pictures of my ultrasound and catch up.

My sisters (30F & 28F) came over to visit while I was at my parent’s house. We were sitting around and chatting when I felt the baby start to act up so I absent mindedly began to rub my belly. My sisters both gave me a look like I was doing something disgusting. They asked me why I was rubbing my belly and told me to stop after I explained. They said it made them uncomfortable. I obliged and stopped thinking they were just being weird.

An hour later I was grilling with my fiancé and was rubbing my belly again. My older sister saw and snapped at me. She told me to stop, it was weird, and I looked like Buddha rubbing his gut. It was offensive, but I stopped to keep the peace. I just wanted to have a good time.

Later we went out for ice cream. Before I got in the car, my twin sister (who is ALSO pregnant but not showing yet) stopped me and made me promise not to rub my belly in the car. She said loudly (to make my older sister laugh, I guess) “No belly-rubbing Buddha’s in MY car.” I said ok. I just wanted ice cream.

While standing in line for ice cream, I began absent mindedly rubbing my belly again. My sister saw, snapped, and shouted “THELACKADAISICAL! STOP! That’s SO weird!” Everyone at the ice cream joint turned and stared at me. It was so embarrassing!

Before leaving for home, I asked my mom what my sisters’ problems were with me. My mom said it was the belly rubbing and it was weird. My fiancé had my back and said explained that it calms the movements and it’s completely normal for me to do that. My mom said I was being overreactive and to imagine how hard it must have been for her when she was pregnant with twins. This still didn’t answer my question, but my mom told me to be “normal” around my sisters and to stop being so sensitive. 

I feel weird bc I thought I wasn’t doing anything wrong! So reddit, am I the big-bellied AH?

EDIT: TL;DR: I rubbed my pregnant belly in front of my family and they felt uncomfortable.

EDIT 2: I’m humbled by the power of reddit! Thank you all so much for your reassurance and advice. I realize now that my actions were normal but my family has some issues they need to work through on their own. I’m not going to waste my time trying to figure out their problems. I’m gonna keep on rubbing my belly and enjoying myself. Maybe I’ll update later after the baby arrives! Thank you all again!! Love, big Buddha belly <3",True,1592610513.0,2020-06-19 18:05:18
AITA for scaring my my daughter to teach her not to scare animals?,15231,Not the A-hole,1486,cqomyq,1565897878.0,"My daughter is 8, and has developed a bad habit of scaring and disturbing animals for fun.


She would jump from behind with a stomp and a ""WA!"" to any animals minding their own business, be it birds, stray cats and dogs and even butterflies and give them a fright, usually resulting them to either run or fly away. 


We tried talking and scolding her, but she just brushed them off. She thought it was okay as long as she doesn't physically harm them.


So a while earlier she was on the sofa playing Nintendo switch, looking very focused, and I decided to let her have a taste of her own medicine.


I approached her from the back quietly before snatching the controller from above(in case she dropped it) with a stomp and a ""WA!"". She was dazed for a moment before bursting into tears. 


My wife called me a childish AH for scaring her like that, but I meant it as a lesson for her to know how animals feel like when she scared them since words could not get to her. AITA?


Edit: I did talked to her and explain why I did it after she calmed down but my wife got in the way and insisted I apologise and make it up for her. I don't think that's appropriate since that defeats the purpose of teaching her a lesson, so I ended up posting on reddit to see if I am really in the wrong.

AITA for turning my son into the police?,15223,Not the A-hole,3365,e1622e,1574663667.0,"My 16 year old son was catfishing people on the internet for petty cash (10-50 dollars per person.) 

I couldn’t believe it. I don’t know how I screwed up as a parent this badly to fail to instill in him that this is wrong and morally depraved behavior. 

I asked why he’d do this to innocent people, mostly elderly people, and he said he needed money to buy things we wouldn’t buy him (video gaming equipment, expensive sneakers, etc.) 

I told him when he asked for those things to go get a job, but he said it would take too long to save up for those things with a job and this was faster. 

His excuse was if they’re stupid enough to fall for his scam, they deserve to have their money taken. But he swore he wouldn’t do it again. 

I didn’t believe him. I couldn’t risk that. I felt I needed him to have a wake up call now when there’s still a chance he’ll turn this behavior and life outlook around. 

I collected all the evidence of what he’d done and reported him to the police. 

After I did this, I was devastated, and called a friend to vent and ask where I’d gone wrong in raising him. 

She was horrified. Not at his behavior but at what I’d done. She said there was no reason I couldn’t have settled the problem within the home and didn’t have to open my son up to the risks of the legal system. 

Now I’m even more broken up. And I don’t want to put our business out there by running the situation by many other people.

AITA for dancing well at a wedding?,15214,Asshole,1957,cocpeh,1565435457.0,"Background: My sister and I have never gotten along. I don't know why, I wish I did so I could fix it but so it goes. I had invited her to come country dancing with me every time I was home, but she never wanted to go.

My date for the wedding was my swing dance partner. We tore up the floor all night long. Any time a country song was on, we'd go dance whether the dance floor was empty or full. We were having a blast which was great because I really didn't want to be there since my sister put my ex of 7 years in the bridal party (the groom didn't really know him at all and turns out he doesn't really like the groom). My dance partner asked my sister if she wanted to dance at least three times, she declined, and danced quite a few times with the maid of honor who doesn't swing dance, but can sure follow a lead and killed it!

A few members of my family have told me that my dancing at the wedding was inappropriate and I should have toned it down. They have even gone so far as to tell me that I hired a professional dancer to be my date (he isn't... I met him Jr year of college when we started dancing weekly together at a bar)

So my question is, am I the asshole for dancing like I know how to dance or should I have dialed it back a but for the wedding?

Edit: Just so it's not hidden in the comments because it's been the center of why most think I'm the asshole, we were doing aerials, not every song, but they were there. 

I've seen some follow up with thank yous and such on the AITA posts, but since this is my first timing posting I'm not sure when to do that. Thanks everyone, you all are right, I didn't think that I had done anything wrong coming into this, but wanted to get the crowd opinion. It seems like popular vote is I made an ass of myself. I just wanted to say thanks for the perspective check. You all gave me some stuff to think about. I had never heard the etiquette rules about aerials either, so that's good to know now too.

AITA for telling my friend that she isn't as attractive as she thinks?,15194,Everyone Sucks,1561,eo8ggg,1578970568.0,"A few nights ago I was hanging out with one of my friends, and we decided to order food through Door Dash. About 30 minutes later, I get a notification that the delivery guy is approaching with our order. Without a word she dashes out of the front room, I'm confused, but the doorbell rings, so I go answer it. 

Once she hears the door close, she saunters back into the room, grabs the food from me and starts pulling out items. Still confused, I ask; 

""What was that all about."" 

She then tells me that she doesn't like to be seen when delivery guys are at the door, because ""they always hit on her."" She then shows me a group of saved messages from delivery drivers/service workers asking her out. Apparently it's a common occurrence for her. 

I was shocked, and we get into a conversation about how inappropriate it is for them to do that. At some point in the conversation she says; 

""That's one of the drawbacks to being really pretty. I mean if I wasn't so obviously out of your league, then I'm sure you would hit on me all the time"" 

I laughed, because I thought she was joking. But she kept pushing this point, so I responded with; 

""Honestly, you're not that attractive, a lot of guys are just desperate, and they probably think they have a chance with a girl who looks like you."" 

She tried to laugh it off as well, but the rest of the night was pretty awkward, and we haven't really spoken to each other since. 

TL;DR - My friend who is constantly being hit on told me I was out of her league. I told her she wasn't as attractive as she thought she was. We haven't spoken since.",True,False,2020-01-13 18:56:08
WIBTA if I ended my friendship with my best friend who is gay?,15180,Not the A-hole,1595,dlig9w,1571782145.0,"Alright, hear me out, because I know how this sounds. I (22M) have been best friends with ""John"" (22M) for about 6 years. We always had a fairly affectionate relationship, but I never really thought much of it. About 5 months ago, John came out to me and I was completely supportive, but to be honest I started to consider some of his actions in a new light. 

For example, he tries to cuddle with me, hug me from behind, etc. I am completely supportive of him being gay, but some of these actions are making me uncomfortable. Also, he is pretty possessive and gets very upset if I ever spend time with a girl over him. He always says things like ""you don't care about me anymore!"", seemingly just to get me to say that I do. It's getting pretty exhausting, and frankly I am starting to wonder whether he has a crush on me based on his behaviour.

I told him about a month ago that I would appreciate if he reduced some of these behaviours, and he did not take it well. He was upset, and again it was about how I am trying to push him away. We haven't hung out quite as much since, but when we do there is just as much physical contact as before, even though that is one of the issues that I addressed.

I feel like I can't put up with this anymore. I want it to be clear that I have **no issue** with him being gay, but I would just prefer if these actions were not directed towards me.

AITA for not taking pictures of my wife at our wedding?,15156,Asshole,2279,czqssq,1567660004.0,"So we tied the knot and decided that after saying 'I do', 'Sarah' and I would each have our own digital camera to take any photos we wanted during the rest of the day to record our own personal memories, then put these in a section of our wedding photo album. It was her idea and I thought it would be fun. 

Fast forward to us getting these photos developed after the honeymoon. We look through them together for the first time- to summarise:

Her photos: Me in my suit, me with our God daughter, me with a few friends, me drunk at the after party. More of guests, decorations, the beaitiful cake but most of them are of me.

My photos: a seagull that was perched on the church, some guests, blurry lights, and many silly pictures of my groomsmen.

As soon as Sarah saw the pictures I had taken, she was clearly holding back tears, and not happy ones. I asked her what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me at first because she felt embarrassed, but after asking a few more times she admitted that she felt disappointed that I hadn't taken a single picture of her in her dress. I basically told her that I didn't really think to, as anyone who has been to a wedding knows that every camera is pointed to the bride. She replied that she wanted to see herself through my eyes on our wedding day. This conversation went round in circles until she just snapped at me that i found a seagull more noteworthy than my bride on our wedding, and now she's gone to bed angry. I feel like this conversation isn't over but as it's our first fight as a married couple, I need to know if I'm in the wrong.

So, am I the asshole here? I... feel like she's overreacting a little. I thought the cameras were intended to record whatever we felt like. I didn't know she'd expect me to take pictures of her.

**EDIT: Info: we did hire a photographer during the ceremony. The cameras were for after, she wanted candid pictures to make memories. I remember her saying she was okay with some being lighthearted. She prefers candid photos because they feel more natural and capture our own memories more**

**EDIT 2** I'm the asshole. And a clueless idiot. From now on I'm going to make up for it with all the candid photos possible, and have noted a few lovely little ideas from commenters. Thank you to all who have judged me, I accept my judgement",True,1567663572.0,2019-09-04 22:06:44
"AITA for bailing on a ""birthday party"" that my parents turned into a party for themselves and their friends?",15129,Not the A-hole,1696,ffycqs,1583804047.0,"I turned 18 a couple of days ago. My parents had been offering to throw me a party at home, and I had said yes at first, I'd like to have five of my female friends over for a girls night, just a chill night with dinner and sitting out by the fire and hanging out to catch up. We are all going to college next year in different places and time to just chill with my friend group is super special to me.

Then my parents got carried away with planning a party, they wanted to invite three families that we're ""family friends"" with... AKA the parents are friends and the kids are put together out of convenience, despite none of us getting along or having much of anything in common, plus the older ones like me always end up stuck babysitting.

I said no, I just want a low key party with my five friends, I don't want a bunch of my parents friends and their kids there. I want the party to be just a girls night, no children or guys because it changes the chill mood. I don't want a big production, just a chill night.

But my parents were adamant that the ""family friends"" were invited, even though I'm in the family, and none of them are my friends. Coming up to the day of the party, I could not convince them otherwise.

So my friends hatched a plan, they'd come to my house early in one of their cars and ""kidnap"" me from the party before it started.

We did that, and right after leaving the house I told my parents by a voicemail that I wanted to just have a chill night with the girls and they could have their party but don't pretend it's for me. And don't worry, we were just going out to eat, no drinking, nothing crazy. And I'd be home by midnight. 

Then my friends and I turned phones off for the night. 

It was really wonderful, just what I wanted. It was the best birthday party ever, I was so grateful that my friends put the whole thing together for me.

But my parents were furious when I got home, I had embarrassed them to the community, I had left without saying where I was or picking up my phone and that scared them, they'd called my friends families and nobody could get in touch with us, the party was a disaster because it was so humiliating to throw a birthday party without the birthday girl, etc.

I said that I'd told them so many times that I didn't want that party, they should have been warned that it wasn't a good idea from that. And that they ought to find some friends who aren't so judgy, because this whole ""keeping up with the Joneses"" game was getting old. And they wouldn't have to do it if they could just find some real friends. Like good friends who don't play these show-offy games.

My mom got mad at me for insulting their frienships, on top of everything else. And I've been suspended from my sports and activities indefinitely as a punishment.

AITA for letting my sister say “Arigato” and “Konnichiwa” at a Korean restaurant?,15122,Not the A-hole,1327,hagoal,1592383636.0,"So. My siblings and I (2 sisters + 3 brothers + me) decided to go to a Korean bbq place a while ago. One of my sisters, let’s call her Maddie is very proud of her language skills. Idk what that even means. She doesn’t let anyone correct her and gets very upset if someone tells her she’s wrong. 

So as soon as we enter the restaurant she greets a waitress with a “konnichiwa”. This waitress is a pro. Doesn’t even look surprised. She greets us in Korean and leads us to a booth. 

We all sit down and hope that maddie doesn’t say anything like that again. No such luck. Every time a waiter/waitress approaches our table she greets them with a “Konnichiwa” and says “arigato” when they put down our food. By the 3rd or 4th time even the staff are looking amused. 

One of my older brothers, brave soul he is tries to tell Maddie to “maybe cut down on the greetings and thanks” since we are at a *Korean* restaurant- emphasis on Korean. She doesn’t get it. 

Enter brave soul sibling number 2: attempts to directly tell her she’s been talking to them in Japanese - gets cut off. None of us try again. 

At the end of the meal, we are all trying to hold back laughter. As we are leaving, sister turn around and says “Konbanwa”. 

After leaving the restaurant I was the first one to break. I start giggling, then my other sister follows as well. Maddie immediately asks us why we’re laughing. We tell her that she’d been speaking Japanese in a Korean restaurant. She vehemently denies it.

WIBTA If I potentially humiliate my mom next time she tells a specific embarrassing story about me?,15103,Not the A-hole,1233,gjo8v8,1589498032.0,"Let me preface this by saying that while this story might paint my mother in a bad light, she did have flaws but was also a very supportive and good mom.

I’m 24 now. 

My mom loves to tell embarrassing stories from my childhood to people. I don’t mind most of them but there is one in particular that really makes me angry every time she tells it because of the backstory. Which is as follows:

I was probably 12/13 and near puberty, my mom was always very open about the changes I would be soon experiencing and bought me everything I needed for when the day came. I was nervous about it but not really embarrassed. My mom had a shower with a clear glass door that I would use because it was a lot nicer than mine. 

One day she’s in the shower and her phone rings and it’s her boyfriend. He was nice and at that point I had met him a few times and liked him. From the shower, she says go ahead and answer and say hello. As I go to answer the phone stops ringing so I unlock it and it opens to the screen of text messages with her and her bf. The most recent text is her saying that she had seen me getting out of the shower and due to the development of some hair in that region, she thinks I’ll be getting my period soon. And she ends it with “Ugh. Not ready for that”

I was fucking humiliated that she would discuss that with anyone let alone her boyfriend who I had met a few times. Her bf did end up becoming my step dad and he is a good man, so I don’t want to paint this in a super creepy manner, I think she was just venting? Idk but regardless it was fucked up in my opinion. I don’t know if it’s normal for parents to talk about their kids like that to people. My stepdad does have children, two girls and 1 boy. One of the girls is in the same age range as me. 

After this I became very secretive and eventually when I did get my first period, I hid it. For as long as I could. Just because I was embarrassed and didn’t want her to tell everyone. She ended up finding out I got it about three months after and flipped her shit that I hid it from her but she didn’t know why because I never told her I saw what she texted about me.

Now for whatever reason she thinks it’s a funny story to tell to people. She told my boyfriend (now fiancé) and I ended up telling him the story behind it afterwards and he was shocked. I’m not embarrassed by periods and puberty now OBVIOUSLY but it hurts every time she mentions the story. 

WIBTA If next time she says it, no matter who is around, I say “well maybe if I wouldn’t have caught you texting your bf about me getting pubes for the first time I wouldn’t have been so humiliated” I think this will really make her upset but also feel like it needs to be said. Also, let me know if I’m overreacting about what she texted.

ETA: When she goes in to the story, I would usually just keep my mouth shut and try to change the subject. The most recent time I told her as she was beginning that I did not want her telling this story again, and when she continued I told her to stop, and she continued. However, I have never sat her down and told her the details mentioned in my post. Seems the best course of action is, like most of you suggested, to just have this convo with her one on one. Maybe I was feeling a little bitter and just wanted to embarrass her like she has me time and time again. Point is I love my mom regardless of her flaws and handling it this way would do nothing but cause hurt and more anger. Thanks everyone :-)",False,1589488568.0,2020-05-14 16:13:52
AITA for not giving the source of my beaded earrings to a white woman?,15087,Everyone Sucks,971,dfgj02,1570653998.0,"I was born on a Res and lived there for most of my life until going to college in a nearby state. In my community, we have a number of talented women who are amazing at beading. They make some truly remarkable stuff. Caveat is that they will only sell or trade to other people from the community, and possibly another tribal group. It's just how they do it. 

I have 30 or so pairs of all kinds and wear them with pride. Almost every day I wear a brick stitch earring of some kind, it's just part of who I am, where I'm from, etc. Brings me a lot of joy.

Anyway a woman at work has really fallen in love with them. She compliments them and examines them. No issue there. Lots of people do. One day recently though, she asked me where I got them and if the person has an ""Etsy"" shop or something where she can buy her own. This woman is white with not a drop of the heritage in her, by her own admission. 

Now... personally I have no issue with white people wearing the earrings! It's not about that. Wear whatever you want. But the women in my community do not sell them to outsiders (again, for the most part). It's just not done. 

I told her no, and she asked for the contact information so she could commission a pair. I told her no again, that the person who makes them is very particular about who she makes them for. She kept pressing me, telling me ""Well let her make that decision!"" and stuff like that. 

I got tired of this and told her, point blank, this person will not create or sell anything for you because you are white. She got extremely upset and threatened to make a statement to HR about me being racially discriminating.

AITA? 

My reasoning is that if she wants beaded earrings, she can learn to make them herself, she can buy them from anyone else (there are so many white women on etsy who make ""boho style"" earrings), etc. She is merely upset because this one person will not cater to her.",True,False,2019-10-09 13:46:38

I was already feeling pretty stressed and anxious about how their conversation was going to go. I don't really have a great relationship with Ashley, so I was just keeping to myself in one of the guest rooms on my laptop with a large glass of wine. About an hour later she comes in, panicked, asking if she can borrow my car. Apparently, her high school aged sister got in a really bad fight with their extremely dysfunctional father and needed to be picked up.

My car is a new Mercedes that cost me around 80 grand. I absolutely did not want her taking my car, especially somewhere that was almost an hour away. I asked her if their dad got physical with her sister in this fight and she said no. So, I told her I would rather her wait until my in laws got back and see if she could take their car. 

She starts yelling at me that they probably won't be back for a few hours and she needs to get her sister ASAP. I told her that unless she believes her sister's safety is at risk, I don't feel comfortable with her taking my car. She asked if I could drive her to get her and I told her I had too much wine to drive. She then proceeds to shit on me for being ""irresponsible"" for drinking and not anticipating I might have to drive, as well as ""selfish"" for not letting her take my car.

There is a treatment I’m on a waitlist for and I can’t start it till they have a copy of my insurance which has been a huge headache to work with. I’ve been waiting for months for this treatment so it’s a pretty big deal that I get my card to then as soon as humanly possible. 

Before I went to the mailbox I saw the neighbors in another one of their fights standing right next to the mailboxes. My boyfriend told me to just wait and check the mail after my appointment to avoid getting involved in their drama. He said we can just drop the card off at the clinic later if it had arrived. I didn’t want to do this because I didn’t want to risk delaying things any longer since this is a treatment I really really need. 

Unfortunately when I went to the mailbox the girlfriend started berating me about “enjoying the show.” I told her I didn’t care about what’s going on with them I just needed to get the mail and then I went back inside. My boyfriend called me an asshole for involving myself and kept saying I told you so. He thinks it’s going to cause problems with them.

WIBTA for contacting the mom of my daughter's (15F) boyfriend (15M) regarding some concerning behavior and messages?,15000,Not the A-hole,658,cpwhrr,1565746625.0,"So my 15 year old daughter is in her first ""serious"" relationship with a boy she was friends with before they started dating.  I put serious in quotes because while they spend time together frequently, they are only ever alone in public places like the mall.  My daughter and I have a good relationship and she has shared that they haven't done anything more than kiss at this point.  I am not naive enough to think they couldn't be doing more, but my daughter has given me no reason to mistrust her.

The problem is that the more time they spend together, the more demanding of her time the boyfriend is becoming.  He calls and texts her constantly and gets upset when she doesn't respond immediately.  She has explained to him that she is not tied to her phone, especially during the summer when she is doing things outside or with friends.  He has told her that he worries about her when she doesn't answer, and if she really loved him she wouldn't make him worry.  She recognizes this as manipulation and has told him that it is not okay.

She sat him down and explained that she does not like how demanding and controlling he is becoming, and explained that if he doesn't stop she will break up with him.  I was very proud of the way she handled it.  We have taught both of our kids that it is important to define your boundaries and then expect the people around you to respect them, as well as taking the time to understand and respect the boundaries of others.  I think this is especially important as they navigate their teenage years.

Last night while she to a 30 minute bath he called her 7 times and sent her over 30 texts that started with him just saying ""Babe, call me"" and culminated in him saying there would be consequences for her ignoring him.  It was the last straw, and she told him she was done.  He then blew up her phone until she blocked him and removed him from all of her social media.  He then started contacting all of the people in their shared group of friends, trying to get them to talk her into giving him another chance.  She.  Is.  Done.

As a mom, I would want to know if my son (13M) was treating someone like this.  I recognize that this is a learning experience for both of them, and hope that this boy can learn to have healthier relationships on the future.  WIBTA for contacting his mom and letting her know everything that has been going on?  We have chatted in the past, and I have her contact info, so it would be easy to get in touch with her.  Or would I be overstepping my bounds by getting involved, since at this point my daughter seems to have done a good job of handling things on her own?

&#x200B;

UPDATE:  I talked with my daughter tonight and told her that I was considering calling his mom to discuss his behavior.  (For the record, I would have done this even without all of the suggestions to do so.  I respect her enough to keep her in the loop.)  I explained that I don't think she could have handled the situation any better than she did, and I am so proud of her for advocating for herself and her boundaries.  But I have concerns about the way he continues to stomp those boundaries and try to manipulate her.  I am also concerned about his future relationships if he doesn't make some serious changes, which probably won't happen without some intervention.

She was not upset at all and said she understood why I would want to call his mom.  She asked that I wait a couple of days to see if he stops the behaviors on his own.  We agreed that if he is still trying to call and text her and her friends by Friday, I will make the call.  As a side note, the friends he has contacted have all told him that he needs to give her space and understand why she broke up with him.  She is lucky to really have a great group of friends.  

&#x200B;

Also, for those of you who have asked... From a very early age we have always emphasized the importance of boundaries with our kids.  We never forbid them from being friends with kids we saw as potential bad influences, but focused on what makes a good friend.  When problems arose, we would talk to them and help them see when someone wasn't respecting them (or when they weren't respecting others).  So her recognizing that he was being manipulative and needy was an extension of that.

I'm 47F, my husband is 49M, my son is 28M, his fiancee is 27F.

When my son proposed, we talked to both he and his fiancee to find out their game plans for the future. We wanted to buy them a house but one question decided *how big*: do they plan on having children?

Their answer was ""yes"", so we did buy them a house, but kept it in our name. Because they were common-law at this point and not yet married, we worried what if they broke their engagement: if the house was in my son's name for example, she would be entitled to some of it. At least in our names, our family is protected. We think the world of his fiancee, this was just a devil's advocate, worst case scenario thing.

They've been engaged for two years and the wedding is coming up this October. But we were hit by a bombshell a couple of weeks ago that they no longer have any desire to have children. This is fine: we don't expect or assume anything, if they don't have kids, it's their life, we don't respect them any less for it. But it made my husband a little tiffed that we specifically bought them a big house under that assumption.

We would have bought them a smaller 2+1 bedroom or thereabouts if they planned on being childfree. But instead we were told children are in their future so we bought them a 5 bedroom home. This is like the difference of a factor of two. We spent our money needlessly.

I'm pushing my husband to sell the house because it's in our name still. My husband says it will create a rift between families but this whole thing was based on misinformation. I don't think they did it with malice ""hehe we get a bigger house if we lie"", but I think they knew they didn't want children. You don't be in a relationship for 8 years and don't have that conversation, right?

Would I be the asshole for selling their home? We'd get them a smaller one, of course, we just don't think they'll need anything bigger. They'd never be homeless.

**EDIT**

Just so it's clear, we don't mind or care if they have children or not. The problem is they have a larger house we bought specifically for a family. Children need extra space. Now that it's out of the question, they can make due with a smaller house.

Our other son is married to a wonderful man and we bought him a house, too. Same kind of scenario as this, they got a 2+1 bedroom house. In our names until they got married, then transferred to their name once married. This is how we're giving our two children wedding gifts. There's already been hubbub between my children ""why does x get a 5 bedroom home when we only got a 2 bedroom"", etc. ""Because they're having children"" can't be our reasoning anymore.",False,1563814478.0,2019-07-22 17:16:08

So there's this guy at my work, James, who makes derogatory jokes about his wife. Any time his spouse comes up in conversation, he'll make one of those 'oh, my wife is such a nag, the old ball-and-chain, *women*, eh?' jokes.  He'll always say it with a big grin and then laugh, but he does it *constantly*.
  
And when I say constantly, I mean constantly.  In the three years I've worked with James, I've only heard him mention his wife without making a joke along those lines maybe three or four times.  It really gets on my nerves to hear him trash talk her all the time.  

Today another coworker of ours said that he was making plans for his anniversary with his wife, and James butted in and said ""oh, yeah, mine's coming up soon, too.  I guess I need to do something or I'll never hear the end of it.""

And I kind of lost my temper and asked him ""If that's the way you feel why are you still married to her?!"" 

James kind of sputtered a bit that he was joking, and I told him that he always talks about being married like it's a burden, and that there comes a point when even the funniest jokes get old, and that his jokes about his wife haven't ever been funny.

It kind of went to an awkward silence until James left for the day.  Some of my coworkers are glad I called him out on it, some of them think what I said went too far.

she made an announcement this week saying that she’ll be charging 50 dollars for every guest who’s coming. she said that they can venmo her the money so there won’t be no problems and everyone who paid will be added onto the “exclusive guest list” which basically means you won’t have to wait in line while other guests pay.

once i read this, i was shocked. i responded asking why and she said she wanted to get the money she spent on her special day back. i told her i wouldn’t be able to come because this was outrageous and that i wish her well on her special day. she contacted my aunt and my aunt called me cheap and rude. my parents offered to pay for my entry, but i refused.

Jake was quite popular and sociable but for some reason kept targeting me, calling me names, slurs, etc. I hated him so much, I'd hate going to school and him being in class. I dreaded it.

Well we found out that Jake unexpectedly passed away in his sleep. When I saw this on Facebook, I saw lots of RIP posts from classmates, but my first reaction was relief. I felt a weight lift off my shoulders.

When I came to class, people were crying and my teacher (50F) said we need to take a moment silence for him. After the silence was done, I just said out loud ''I don't care that Jake died. He was a bully''. People looked at me instantly and gave me death stares, I could hear some people muttering swear words.

But then some people came up to me and thanked me, they said they hated Jake too. Honestly I'm fucking glad he's dead. I feel so much better about my life now. Some classmates called me AH, his girlfriend (ex now lol) came up to me and called me every name under the sun, AH was one of them. I just said to her ''You need to calm down and relax'' and walked away. 

I honestly feel good and so do some other classmates. AITA?

WIBTA for cutting off my mother because she tried to make me talk to my ex?,14946,Not the A-hole,751,gvtfnj,1591217750.0,"My ex and I split when our son was a year old. I have majority custody of our now 6 year old, and my ex only has alternate weekends due to failure to show at the meeting where we were meant to agree on custody. My boyfriend of 4 years proposed 3 months ago, and a month later we posted about it on social media to inform anyone who hadn't already been told. My ex contacted me privately saying he wanted to ""check him out"" before he becomes our son's stepdad. They've met but it's always been a 10 second thing as he picks up/drops off our son, so my boyfriend said they could talk properly over skype. He decided to record before going on, and he was right to as my ex says in the recording that a kid needs bio parents, not step, and that my boyfriend should ""bow out"" so my ex can step in and try and get back with me, and hinted that if he wouldn't do that he'd go for full custody. My boyfriend ended the call and showed me the recording.

I've consulted my lawyer every step of the way, I've kept logs of weekends he hasn't shown and screenshots of his explanations, and my lawyer has a copy of the recording. She said there's not enough for any further action as of right now, but if anything happens we can probably do something with the evidence I've given her. She gave me a template of what to say to my ex.

I sent the template to my ex. It said that I knew what he'd said to my boyfriend and that while he was still welcome to have his weekends with our son, I didn't want to interact with him, I don't want him talking to my boyfriend like that and he could contact me by texting my phone but I'd be blocking him on social media. My ex replied that's fair, he understands and he'll respect my wishes.

Today I took my son to visit my parents (fiance is working). My parents are aware of what happened with my ex. Haven't seen my parents since Christmas, and now we're safe to see them so we took the opportunity. Dad answered the door and whispered ""your mum invited \[Ex\]. She wants you to talk. I told her no but he's here"". My son and I got back into the car and left.

We got home and I turned my phone on (I always have it off while driving) and I've received nearly 30 calls in the 3 hours I was driving, all from mum, saying leaving was immature and escalating to her literally crying because she's not seen my son and I in about 6 months. I called her and said she had no right to do that and I had half a mind to cut contact with her because I don't need people I can't trust in my life. This didn't exactly cheer her up and while my fiance agrees that that was a stupid thing for her to do and he no longer trusts her, my dad, who has been on my side up until now, has said that if I'm cutting contact with mum then he's cutting contact with me, and saying that she went too far but I'm going overboard.

WIBTA for cutting mum off?

Info: mum is a big believer in the regular family dynamic of 2 married parents, and no step parents/step siblings/half siblings (my fiance and I are planning on having 1 or 2 more after marriage) and therefore mum dislikes my fiance as she, like my ex, feels that my fiance is the only thing stopping me and my ex from getting back together (he's really not).

They're mostly younger men who will turn ANYTHING into 1 of 2 things: A dick measuring contest, or a very obnoxious joke.

They have jumped on the 'Karen' meme with both feet, both hands and a duck. The only issue is that they don't just use the name Karen to talk about someone who is behaving in that snobbish 'I want to speak to your manager!' way, they use it for all women.

Woman standing in line? Karen. Hairdresser full of women? Crowd of Karens. Older woman getting on the bus? Old Karen. Couple of female kids (looked about 8/9) in their brownie uniform doing litter picking with a group? Little Karens.

Resultantly, all women = Karen and Karen = deserving of ridicule and mockery, and thus we have ended up at all women = deserving of ridicule and mockery.

And I ignored it at first, figuring that it wouldn't last and they'd move onto something new, as they normally do, but it's been MONTHS, and they're still doing it. An attempt at a light hearted convo I tried with one of them pointing out that maybe it was problematic got me, unsurprisingly, called a Karen. So....I started calling all men Kevin whenever I am in earshot of one of them.

Including them. And when I am referring to them, I really go all out. Like, make it a really loud nasal whine and draw the word out. ESPECIALLY if they're pissed off about losing a sale. ""Awww, is KEEEEEVIIIIIIIN having a bad day?""

This, apparently, is a lot funnier than their Karen line, so other people have picked it up and run with it. So now sales are pissed, and telling me I'm the AHole. I don't think I am, and am planning on letting it run for maybe a week or so after they drop the Karen thing, THEN I'll drop it.

"AITA for ""poisoning"" my cousin by feeding him cooked onions?",14883,Not the A-hole,2295,gy4rjf,1591527918.0,"I know this sounds ridiculous but please bare with me.

My cousin (M16) is spending the summer with me (F16) and my family. As both of my parents work, I am expected to get food for lunch for me and my cousin and to cook dinner for the family.

The problem is my cousin is super picky with food. He has a very odd list of food that he will eat (traditional french dishes, fast food, junk food, sushi, pizza, steak tartare, etc) but he also has a long list of foods that he will not eat. This list includes most vegetables (including broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and corn), some sorts of meat (turkey, duck, rabbit), most types of grains (barley, couscous, and brown rice), and then a bunch of other random foods (ketchup, apples, mayonnaise, bananas). 

He will basically throw a fit if a meal isn't to his liking. It's become a big problem because my family and I normally eat a very diverse diet with a lot of different dishes from different cultures with many ingredients that he won't eat. He complained incessantly when we ate at a vegan or Moroccan restaurant, and one time when I made Indian food (palak paneer) he refused to eat it.

His most annoying food restriction is that he hates cooked onions and won't eat them AT ALL. He is way more serious about this restriction than the others. I have seen him eat raw onions so I know he's not allergic, and when I visited him last summer I'm pretty sure he ate cooked onions in a dish his dad made without his knowledge. It's very annoying because I put onions in almost anything, and if he even detects an onion he won't eat any part of the dish.

Yesterday I decided to make a quiche for dinner. The way I make quiche includes onions as a major part of the dish, but I knew my cousin wouldn't eat it if I put onions in it. So I decided to chop them up very finely and hide them amongst the rest of the quiche and hope he wouldn't realize they were there. 

When it came to dinner time I didn't tell him it had onions in it as I usually do with other dishes. He ate it and he liked it. I probably should have left well enough alone, but after dinner I told him that there were actually onions in it and that he should try to be less picky.

He got very angry and called his parents. His father thought it was hilarious and so did my parents, but my aunt is angry at me, said it was basically poisoning, and said I shouldn't have done it. AITA?",False,False,2020-06-07 04:05:18
AITA for refusing to leave my (24M) brother’s (24M) funeral after cursing out my aunt (55F)?,14867,Not the A-hole,1082,gzyxbb,1591773811.0,"I’m not a good storyteller so I’ll try to keep this short and sweet... Last week, my family and I (24M) put my twin brother to rest. He crashed his motorcycle, and the EMTs weren’t able to arrive in time to save him. It’s been a lot to deal with since we were making plans to hang out now that restaurants and bars have begun opening back up.

The funeral was a pretty small family gathering. Two of my brother’s friends came and offered their sympathy, which was nice. Our mom was inconsolable. Dad did his best to comfort her. I stepped out for a minute to have a cigarette before the service, trying to decide what I wanted to say about my brother. My aunt (55F) came out to say hi, then brought up how awful she feels for my parents, having to bury their own son.

I nodded and started to say something, but then she was like, “Do you think it’s really appropriate for you to be here?”

I was so confused like uhhhh that’s my fucking BROTHER. I didn’t say that yet, just stared at her like she must be telling some weird joke. I settled for “Are you kidding me?”

Then she said, “With you two being identical twins, it must be like seeing a ghost. I really think you should leave, it might make this easier on your mom.” 

I completely lost it. I tried to stay firm but calm, saying she had NO RIGHT to say something like that to me, but my emotions got the best of me and I started screaming. I called her some choice words, and my dad came out as I was calling her an evil bitch. I admit that may have been too much, and my dad yelled at me not to talk to his sister that way. He pulled her back inside and looked at me with this disappointed expression.

I went back in before the service. My aunt sat far from me and didn’t acknowledge me for the rest of the day. My parents didn’t bring it up either. A few days later, my dad calls and says he wasn’t sure what had happened, but there had been no need to cause a scene on a day like that. I explained myself but he’s not replied. My cousins think I’m a douchebag.

AITA?

TL;DR: My aunt told me I shouldn’t be at my twin brother’s funeral because it would make my parents uncomfortable, I called her an evil bitch

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who offered their sympathy. I didn’t expect this to blow up so quickly; I am trying to get back to as many people as possible.

I want to say that I finally heard back from my dad yesterday — he is technologically illiterate so mom had to show him my message that he never opened. He called me and we talked for a while, then he confessed something really bizarre to me in defense of my aunt. When she was my age, she had been pregnant with twins, and she was really excited about them — she had little matching hats and booties ready and everything even before her second trimester. 

Well, one absorbed the other. She was so distraught, and she ended up aborting the other (it may have been pressure from her now-late husband). This is somehow bringing up that old wound.

I feel like my dad’s kind of grasping for straws, but I held my tongue this time and apologized for making a scene. I’m going to talk to my aunt soon, too.

I know that Dina is super private and comes from a really conservative household, and wouldn't dare tell her parents about her being sexually active. I asked my sister how my mom knew, and apparently my mom's best friend, let's call her Miss Annie (not Dina's mother) is very good friends with Dina's PCP, who told her the gossip.

Throwaway because my friend knows my main reddit account. Also English is not my first language so apologies for any grammar or spelling mistakes.

I will refer to the country we initially planned to go to as country X and the country my friend might be going to as country Y. I might also consider editing this post later on to hide other personal information to make it less obvious it’s me in case people I know see this post. Hope that’s fine.

Ever since I was a child, I always dreamed of studying abroad. We all know the benefits of studying abroad and I am sure if I don’t profit from this now I will forever regret it later on. Luckily for me, my parents are financially stable and can afford sending me abroad in order to gain such an invaluable experience. However there is one catch, that is, I must go with a friend of mine as they won’t send me there alone. I thought this wasn’t a problem since I have been planning to go with my friend to country X.

This month, things changed. My friend and I applied to 2 universities in different countries. One of them doesn’t have a capita on the number of students it can accept but the other one does. My friend got accepted to both of them but I only did to one. Both of them are good universities and objectively one is not better than the other but their education system does differ. When my friend got accepted to the university in country Y she told me that there is a possibility she will go there instead as she has relatives there that will allow her to stay in their house without her having to pay rent.

I was heartbroken by the news. How could she do this to me? She knows how much I want to study abroad and is well aware of the fact that my parents will not let me go alone. I told my parents about this and they assured me that if there is no other person I can go with then I will be studying here instead. I could not let this happen. Although she didn’t say she is going to do it for sure yet, I need a definite answer or else I’ll keep being stressed about it. My friend once told me her password on a game we play and I tried to see if she has the same password for her email and it turns out she does. So I logged in and rejected her admission offer and logged out. My friend still doesn’t know this but she will soon. I told my parents about it to assure them that my friend will now be going with me but they got so upset on me and are now threatening me that they are going to call my friends parents and tell them what I did. I begged them not to but they are not listening. They want to do it in case she can still email the university. In the end I told them to let me tell her instead and they agreed to it (although I don’t think I will).

Now that you guys know why I did this, do you still think I am the asshole here? What’s my fault for being forced to go with a friend?

AITA for not saving food for my boyfriend's pregnant stepmom after she commented about my ethnic food looking like poop and making the whole dish for her again?,14822,Not the A-hole,1252,g1envl,1586929767.0,"I'm a 24 year old woman of Indian heritage and I've been dating my white boyfriend (26) for the past 3 years. 

My boyfriend loves my cooking I often cook Indian dishes like Butter chicken, saag paneer, tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala for him. 

So back in mid march, my boyfriend's father and his wife came to visit us all the way from Alabama to tell my boyfriend about their pregnancy. Of course, we had no idea that she was 5 months pregnant when they told us they were coming over. 

We assumed it would a 3 night thing and then we'd go back to living our normal lives. 

Obviously, the situation changed and they're now stuck here for a while. 

Truth be told, we were definitely not prepared for their extended stay. Now, I often cook Indian for my boyfriend and I have a lot of spices and masalas stored in my kitchen. (Some of which I actually got from my ancestral village in India).


Turns out his stepmom can't handle the smell of Indian spices, so we decided to stop cooking Indian food. 

However, last night we were basically like F it! we have had enough! and decided to treat ourselves to a garlic naan and butter chicken dinner. 

His stepmom and father were at the hospital the whole day, and I utilized that time to cook. 

When they got home, my boyfriend and I were just about to start our dinner. The moment she stepped inside, she scrunched her nose up in disgust and complained about our home smelling like curry. 

Then she asked what was in the menu. When I offered them to eat with us, she said that she'd rather not as the food apparently looked like poop. I was legitimately angry at this point, but I wasn't going to lose my cool on a pregnant lady. 

Later in the night, she had a craving and woke me up from my sleep asking for left over butter chicken. Oops. We didn't save any. 

She then ordered my boyfriend's dad to get her  Indian food. The poor dude spent 2 hours out driving in the middle of the night looking for Indian food but he didn't get any. 

When he came back empty handed, his wife threw a toddler tantrum crying about wanting butter chicken. His dad then asked me to cook it for her. I put my foot down. It was 4 in the morning and I didn't want to spend 4 hours in the kitchen. 

His stepmom then guilt tripped my boyfriend about not caring about his unborn brother. (WTF?)

AITA for coming off as pregnant at my sister's wedding? I'm a newly sober alcoholic.,14823,Not the A-hole,1605,f2sz8n,1581550652.0,"
I am a woman in my late 20s and I've very recently started to realize I've got a binge drinking problem...

I've very recently started going to a therapist, and she is also referring me to a recovery program that I'll be starting soon. But as of now, I'm really early on in this whole process and I've only told my husband, who had been the only person to really notice I had a problem.

Last week was my sister's wedding. We aren't too close, she's almost ten years older than me. I wasn't in the bridal party, she had a small party of her friends. I wasn't upset or insulted by that.

At the wedding, there was an open bar, champagne at every table, and pretty much everyone was drinking. 

I got myself a glass of water and I felt like I stood out a little for not drinking. A couple people offered me drinks, my brother, my uncle and aunt, even family of the groom who were mingling with us. I'd always decline politely, ""no thanks"" ""I'm good for now"" Nobody asked any questions for a while. 

Until it was time for speeches and toasts. 

My aunt was pouring out champagne for everyone and I was like ""no thanks"" and she asked ""Oh why not?""

I didn't want to say much so I was just like ""oh just for personal reasons, I'm not drinking right now"" and she was like ""Are you..."" And wiggled her eyebrows in a way that seemed to mean something.

I had no fucking idea what she was getting at. The anxious part of my brain was filling that empty space with questions like ""Are you an alcoholic?"" ""Are you afraid you're gonna binge drink if you start drinking?"" Etc...

I know how dumb it sounds that I didn't realize, all I can say is that none of my friends or close family have kids, I don't think much about what signals a pregnancy. But I've had a couple people in my life get sober because of drinking problems. So that's the connection that I saw as obvious.

I just froze up and shrugged awkwardly.

I didn't think any more about it until later. My husband came to me and said that people were congratulating him on the baby. I was like ""what the fuck, what baby?"" And he was like ""yeah I asked the same thing, apparently your aunt is going around saying we're expecting. I was baffled.

It was only later that i understood. My sister came to me furious at stealing the spotlight from her on her wedding day, being jealous I'm not in the wedding party, making drama by making people think I was pregnant when I'm not, being all coy about not drinking when ""everyone knows what that means"" 

I told her that I wasn't drinking because I've had a drinking problem for a while, and needed to stop. And she just didn't believe me. She said that the timing was too convenient, that she's never seen a problem before, and that I was obviously bitter that I'm not the center of attention for once.

I didn't know what else to say or how to make her understand.

My FWB knew this because we’ve had many discussions on how we’d both be unfit parents and as such I always make sure to wear protection. She uses the pill but hey, here we are, she’s pregnant and she’s insisting it’s mine. 

I told her that there’s no way I’m about to be a dad. I simply can’t do it. I’ll find the money to pay whatever I got to pay her but I’m not about to play daddy when I never wanted this. She in turn has reached out to our friend group and one by one they’ve turned on me and told me I’m worthless for not wanting to step up to be a father.

AITA for pressing charges on my Daughter for Fraud?,14785,Not the A-hole,3187,cg7vm0,1563793901.0,"Me and my wife recently found out that her daughter (my step-daughter, though I consider her close enough to my own after having raised her for 18 years) has taken out about $60,000 in loan debt under our name, without our permission. For some basic context, she took out a Parent Plus Loan for school, under our name and social security number, without asking us. In her first semester of her Freshman Year, she did come to us, asking if we would fill out the paperwork for her, since her school's loans were only for about $5000 for the whole year. We explained that we didn't have the financial means to take out a loan for the amount she was requesting; about $14,000 a year, but offered to help her find scholarships or work-study, and other ways to potentially help her cover her costs. After me and her applied for about 5-10 scholarships, and she got a part-time job, she never came back to me and my wife with any financial aid concerns again, so we figured that she had largely figured it up. We brought up tuition a couple times, but every time we'd ask, she'd just say that she was able to cover it all, and didn't need any help with it or anything.

Come us, a couple years down the road. We've gotten a letter from the Department of Education saying that 'our' loan has gone into default, and has been so for about a year at this point. We reach out to her school and, after a little bit of digging, we discover that after we had told her ""no"" on the loan, she had gone around our back and applied for it all online. She filled in her own contact information instead of our own, and the loan went through just fine, since she had the correct Social Security Numbers and all. We've spoken with the school and the DoE a fair amount about this already, and we basically have 2 options for this. We can either eat the loan, and pay it all back ourselves (something not at all financially feasible for my family, since we have about $40k in Medical Debt on top of this now), or to go through the state to press charges on each one of the 5 loans she's taken out; each loan being over $10,000, making this a Felony in my state with a minimum prison sentence. At this point, I'm not certain what my family \*can\* do. We don't have the money to be able to pay this loan back, but me and my wife are emotionally wrecked at even the thought of pressing charges against our own daughter. So, here's the important question, reddit: if I press charges here, AITA?

Edit: Since there's a little bit of confusion, a bit of clarification. A Plus Loan is a loan that we would take out in our own name, to give her extra funds for education. Because we would ordinarily be the ones taking it out, she's not involved with the Repayment Process at all; she's not even technically eligible to make payments towards it, since it's under our own name.  


Edit 2: I promised myself I would never do anything stupid like this if I ever had a post blow up, but now I truly understand what RIP Inbox means. I really truly would like to thank everyone here for their support; I know reddit is one of the few places I can make a post and expect to get a reply.  


In reality, even though I've gotten a huge outpouring of support saying I WNBTA (is that a thing? idk) if me and my wife go through with this, I'm still 100% split about how I actually want to go.

They flew us out for their anniversary. Our parents buy all of us tickets on the same flight.  My sister has two kids - a 6 month old and a 5 year old. She is currently separated from her husband so she would have to handle 2 children by herself on a 10 hour flight. Or so I thought.

She calls me up a week or so beforehand and asks me if I will be willing to help her take care of her kids on the flight, and something about taking shifts so we can both sleep. I tell her that I wasn't comfortable with that, but she says ""nephew loves you so much"" so we can work something out on the flight and hangs up.

I was pissed. I didn't sign up for mid flight babysitting. I called my airline office and asked if they had any business class seats available. They said yes, and I upgraded using a mix of points + money. The upgrade cost me $50 out of pocket, the rest covered by my frequent flyer miles and it was money well spent to be able to sleep.

I get to the airport, check in and wait around for my sister to show up. She does, and I eventually tell her that I upgraded. She... didn't seem too happy. She still sends me little screenshots of how important family is and how we should care about them.

I mean, the only reason why I upgraded was because she expected me to babysit. And I didn't give her a heads up.

And for everyone that said I didn't tell her I didn't want to do it: I did. I did tell her over that phone call I didn't want to do it. She does have a history of dumping her kids with me, and I didn't want to spend 10 hours on the plane with them, only to spend another week with them in a foreign country - where I did babysit them while she went sightseeing for ""me time"".

I don‘t normally go through her room, but the router for the house is in there, and I needed to reset it. When I go into her room, I found a mushroom cap on black paper hidden underneath her desk. I look up what the hell it is and it is a spore print for magic mushrooms. I go through her room further to find an entire damn aqarium filled with mushrooms in the back of her closet. obviously I am enraged, so I wait for her to get back from school, and I called the police. She was arrested, booked and released into her mother’s custody.

Her mother is pissed, and saying that I may have ruined the kids life for no reason, but we have tried to correct her drug abuse several times to no avail, and it has escalated.

AITA for being so upset with my bridesmaids behaviour on my wedding day?,14731,Not the A-hole,1548,ey9wsy,1580777376.0,"Throwaway.

I got married two weekends ago. I asked my three best friends Anna, Kelly and Laura to be my bridesmaids 2 years before the wedding and found them very helpful when planning.

For the morning of my wedding I hired a fancy penthouse apartment for myself and the bridesmaids to get ready. We had champagne and as we were pouring it out, Laura said none for her. Now Laura is the biggest party animal of us all so naturally we questioned why she wasn’t drinking. Laura then told us she was pregnant. 

Of course I was happy for her but obviously the focus was then on Laura and her pregnancy and not us getting ready for my wedding, something I had been planning for 2 years. 

Anyway. We all got ready and headed to the venue. The photographer kept us outside the venue for a short while so he could do posed photos with myself and the bridesmaids. I was holding my bouquet, Anna and Kelly were holding theirs but Laura placed hers on the floor and was standing with her hands cradling her stomach as if to emphasise her bump (which wasn’t noticeable as she’s barely 12 weeks). The photographer asked her to pick her flowers up so all of us were holding our bouquets and Laura refused and said “oh it’s ok I’d prefer to stand like this” and carried on cradling her stomach. So now those photos just look weird.

The rest of the day went smoothly until it came to the speeches. As Laura was my oldest friend naturally I asked her to say a few words. She stood up and said some nice words, then ended her speech with “and I’m so excited to announce that as Bride’s best friend, I’d like her to be an honorary aunt to my baby who is due summer 2020!”. With her being an old family friend of course my family were over the moon and again the attention was on her and her pregnancy and not me and my husband. 

I felt so upset on my wedding day and haven’t really spoke to Laura much since. She has since sent me a text saying I’m acting like a spoiled brat and the world doesn’t revolve around me.

To make it you need breadfruit, which I could not find anywhere. I've driven around the town trying to find it, but no dice. Instead I've been making the curry using potato. The first few times she asked what's in it, I told her truthfully that it was potato. She looked so sad, and even cried a little. She refused to eat anything those nights. Now when grandma asks what's in it, I reply ""it's breadfruit"". Her face absolutely lights up. She used to have this breadfruit curry as a child, but now can't really tell the difference between it and potato. She's in her 80s, I honestly think she has good memories of eating said food, but can't really remember its taste.

She's going back to a nursing home in a few weeks, and I know that ""breadfruit curry"" will not be a menu option. I'm still running around trying to find actual breadfruit, but until then potato it is.

She's been consistently asking for this for dinner every night, and refuses when I offer to make her something else.

My family found out what I was doing and is kind of split. My sister thinks I'm being incredibly deceptive and should stop lying to her, while my cousin thinks that I'm just making grandma happy before she goes to her nursing home.

AITA for telling my wife we shouldn’t call 911 every time our daughter has a seizure?,14701,Not the A-hole,1399,ehpxix,1577759607.0,"Background: Our 4yo daughter has febrile seizures, which cause her body temp to spike during fevers, resulting in a short seizure. My wife has an anxiety disorder and becomes easily overwhelmed under stress. 

After her first seizing episode, we went to a neurologist who diagnosed the febrile seizures. His directions for responding to a seizure were to strip our daughter down, put a cool cloth on her body, and wait for her temperature to drop. Then pump her full of Motrin to manage the fever. He said, while scary, the seizures were harmless and she would grow out of them. No long-term effects, no worry of anything beyond 5 minutes of shaking while her body cooled itself down. 

Since then, we’ve experienced about 6 seizures, 4 of which I was home for. I followed the neurologist’s directions and we got through the seizures like a breeze. In a matter of minutes, she was up and wanting to play again. My wife’s initial reaction, however, was to cuddle our daughter in the bed, which actually increased her body temp. In each case, I had to argue with my wife to let go of our daughter so I could cool her down. The cuddling was a result of my wife’s anxiety and her need to soothe herself by nurturing our sick daughter. I get that, but it was the opposite of what we needed to do in that moment. 

On the 2 occasions I wasn’t home for the seizures, my wife called 911 and an ambulance came. Both times, I rushed home to inform the 1st responders about her condition and instructed them on how to cool her down. Both times they recommended taking her to the ER, and both times we ended up paying $1000 for a 4-hour ER visit where they gave her nothing more than a dose of children’s Motrin. 

AITA for telling my wife that we need to follow our neurologist’s directions instead of calling 911 and racking up unnecessary medical bills? I showed her the most recent bill and she accused me of caring more about money than her mental health or our daughter’s health. I don’t think that’s the case at all. In her words, it’s worth $1000 for her (my wife) to be surrounded by medical professionals, and if I don’t agree, then I’m the bad guy. In my view, my wife needs to work with her therapist so she can better handle stress, and can follow our doctor’s directions when our daughter has a seizure while I’m not home.",False,False,2019-12-30 18:33:27

My husband and I have known each other for about 15 years. He's always had this really bad pain in his back, but he's tolerated and been relatively fine... until now. In about January it reached a point where he couldn't be up for more than an hour or else he'd be on the floor in agony. You don't have to be a doctor to know that this is NOT normal.

Unfortunately, my husband refused to go to the hospital despite all my pleading with him. Told me he was fine. HE WAS NOT FINE. His whole family, (me, our kids, his parents) begged with him to go see a doctor and he would just outright refuse. (I've been trying to convince him for roughly 15 years, since I met him.)

So, at the beginning of this month, I stopped eating. I told him ""Husband, you need to see a doctor. Until you see a doctor, I'm not going to eat."" He initially didn't believe me, but after a week he started to get nervous and worried. At a week and three days, he broke and went to the hospital. While he was in the hospital, I got something to eat.

When he got back home with his sister, she started berating me and basically told me that I was a ""manipulative cunt"" and ""how dare i bully him like this?"" He stayed silent, and when she left, he agreed.

No diagnosis, unfortunately, but now we got confirmation that something is really wrong and he's getting tests done.

I'm completely fine, but I do not recommend this method of persuasion.

Now, though, I'm wondering if I really am a manipulative cunt for doing this. It felt like a last resort.

We were invited to a party, I had agreed to bring a cake to (yes, stupid me). We had to leave at 4.15pm.
After breakfast my husband went outside to cut down a tree. Don't get me wrong, it had to be cut down, but on that day?

So this took him a lot of time. I came outside a few times, carrying our crying baby, asked him to please consider the time and that I had to do things too (including making a cake and taking a shower). Well, he didn't, so I had to make a cake with a crying baby.

My husband finally came in at 3.15pm and took a shower. At about 3.40pm, he finally took our son, so I had my very first time alone that day, which I had to use, to rush with showering and getting ready for the party.

As this was my only alone time in the day and I had counted on it to survive the rest of the day, I got really angry and told him, to at least leave me alone 'till I was ready.

So my toddler is in the throws of her terrible twos and has her back molars coming in, which makes any time she is awake an absolute misery. Naptime and bedtime are currently my favorite times of day. I'd finally gotten her down after MUCH struggle. About 30 minutes into her nap theres a knock at the door. Now, while a knock might not awaken the toddler, my idiot dogs will. They get excited because they think every knock at the door is their favorite person (the UPS lady who always has treats and pats) and started barking.

I opened the door slightly so the dummies couldn't run out only to see two young mormon missionaries. I should note, they stop by here like every other month because my husband is WAY to nice and will engage them every time. I'm not as nice, admittedly, and will usually let him just deal with them. But he works 3rd shift so sleeps during the day, so I couldn't get him to deal with them. As soon as I spotted them I told them ""Sorry. I've got a napping toddler, I don't have time for this."" 

The guy steps closer to me, puts his hand on my door as if to hold it open and starts saying ""ma'am we just need a moment of your time"" (which we all know is b.s., it is never 'just a moment')

I. Got. Pissed. I yanked the door slightly to dislodge his hand off of my door and then told him ""yeah, you need to F*CK RIGHT OFF"" before I slammed the door.

Husband came out and, while he gets I didnt want to wake up the baby, he tried to tell me I should've ""handled it better and not been such an asshole""

I pretty much told him the same thing I told the mormon kid. Luckily, angry child is back asleep and dogs have calmed down. So AITA??

Edit: I wanted to add, cause I'm getting tired fingers from saying the same thing over and over; we've tried signs in the past. My hubs has worked 3rd shift for almost a decade so we've tried variations upon variations of ways to keep people from waking him up. Everyone but the religious door knockers respect the sign.

AITA for accepting an inheritance?,14625,Not the A-hole,990,ga41du,1588169182.0,"EDIT: I am honestly floored with this response. I just posted on here to kinda vent about my situation since a friend brought it up yesterday and asked how I was doing. Thought I'd post an update to share context and how things are going.

My mom, dad, and Sarah are all from the same home country. When she got pregnant my mom was already in the process of moving to the US. That's the only reason I grew up away from my dad. They're from a country where having a ""second"" family is pretty common for men of a certain social class (even prominent politicians have several families on the side), but our situation was frowned upon because it's expected that you treat it super discreetly and in secret, and we were pretty open about it which is practically unheard of, and apparently embarrassing for some members of the extended family.

With regards to how things are going now: my oldest brother is a lawyer and has assured me several times over the past few months that the family doesn't really have a legal claim with contesting the will, and with the courts closed because of [redacted] he's confident that this will all blow over soon. The entire situation really isn't about the money, a lot of the comments were right in saying that it's mostly about appearances and keeping money within the family. He actually saw this post and called me, and he agrees that I should honor his mom's wishes in keeping the money, and that if I feel a bit uncomfortable taking it to think about it as a last gift from his mom to show that she thinks of me as family, too. I admit I had a good cry over that. My brother says I should go and buy something nice for myself, but I'm thinking of using some of it to donate to animal charities since Sarah really loved her dogs (they were in her will, too!). All in all, I feel so much better about the situation knowing my family has my back.

So that's it. Thank you for all your kind comments, especially the ones talking about how lovely Sarah was. My brother really loved those!

Throwaway because some of my cousins might recognize the situation.

I won't mince words: I'm (22F) the product of an affair. My father comes from a wealthy family and is a businessman in Asia, and my mother used to be a flight attendant in the 90s. My dad has always been there when I was growing up, even if my mom and I live in the US, and has provided for us financially. His “real” family knows about me: he and his wife “Sarah” got married out of business convenience and she’s never resented me or made me feel bad in any way. I’ve always respected her for letting me have a relationship with my older brothers, and letting me come with their family on summer vacations. She even sent our family flowers when my mom got married a few years ago. Sadly Sarah passed away from cancer a few months ago. It’s been rough on my dad and brothers, she was a wonderful, kind woman and I miss her a lot. 

Sarah was very, very wealthy and left my brothers a significant inheritance. Apparently she also left me something in her will: a few thousand dollars. I burst into tears when my brothers called me with the news, I didn’t expect her to even acknowledge me in any way as her husband’s bastard child even if we had a good relationship.

AITA for not fessing up to causing a coworkers allergic reaction?,14617,No A-holes here,2060,dby7xn,1569986141.0,"Last week one of my coworkers started to feel unwell and another coworker took her to the ER. She was having an allergic reaction. She has an allergy towards peanuts and thinking back on it I probably caused the reaction since we both had had to use the same computer to check order and I had peanut butter on my waffles that morning. I definitely don't think I washed my hands after either. Once somebody got the call she was ok they asked us all in a group who had had peanut butter that day and I stayed completely silent.

Well, yesterday she came back into work. She was fine and everything, but apparently the trip to the ER still cost her $300 after insurance plus the money she lost not going to work for a two days. Our coworkers all sympathized and a few started saying whoever had the peanut butter should have to pay. Since I wasn't part of that conversation. I just heard them from across the room, I just focused on my work an tried to avoid the subject for the rest of the day.

Now C trusts me and despite knowing that John might be interested, he let’s me handle it by myself.

I’ve tried to make it painfully a obvious to John, who knows I’m in a relationship. I might say things like “wow you’re a great friend to me”. 

When asked if I’m interested, in front of him, I would say “No, he’s like a brother to me”

Now John and I were at a friends place (still social distancing ofc) and were helping set up her tv. 

The others were in the living room, while John dragged me aside and to quote what he said “-twinklefloof- I’ve really liked you for some time now, do you mind maybe giving me a shot”

I was really surprised and the only thing I could think to say was “yikes” and dashed out of there, it was awkward the rest of the time, and he never said a word after that.

When coming home and telling my boyfriend, he was pissed that John tried to initiate something, but is glad I shut it down so quickly.

We obliged and she’s staying in what is normally my husbands home office/computer room. He moved all his stuff to the master bedroom, which took a decent amount of effort.

We normally watch TV together or sometimes he’ll play on the ps4 and I’ll watch and we’ll cuddle. It’s not overtly sexual and we don’t make any noises, just a generic side hug and maybe some hand holding. I figure pretty normal stuff, even if we were in public. 

My sister yesterday asked me to stop doing that and “save it for the bedroom”. I think that it’s pretty outrageous for her to ask to stay in our pretty small apartment, and then ask us to accommodate her further by hiding away in the bedroom. I told her no and we continued like normal today.

Today she interrupted us by standing in front of the TV, and said that she asked nicely and that it’s “gross” that we’re intentionally making her uncomfortable. My husband then asked what she was talking about because I never told him, and it just devolved into a three way fight. My husband is mad at me because he thinks I should have told him because he doesn’t want to make it weird since she might be stuck here for months, even it’s slightly unreasonable, she’s mad at me for the obvious and now I’m mad at both of them.

When he leaves I open the gift and there it was. A decent looking WHITE stand mixer (that's important for later) and was around £80 in value. I used this multiple times in the kitchen and enjoyed using it as it was a great tool for the kitchen.

A few months later I wanted to make some croissants and asked my mom. She said yes. I went to the kitchen looking for the stand mixer and it was gone. I looked everywhere for it and couldn't find it. I asked my mom where it was and she said she gave it away to charity. I WENT MENTAL

I said a few hateful words saying how stupid she for giving away MY birthday present away for FREE when it wasn't cheap. She said I was in no position to tell her what she can and cant do as it was her kitchen and apparently HER STAND MIXER. I was done at that point and asked why would she even do something like that and her answer was.

It didn't fit in the kitchen since it was white, not black.
I gave up at that point and went to sleep as I had nothing to do. And two weeks later she bought another stand mixer which was almost double the price same brand, same wattage but black. Now, since this wasn't my mixer I was not allowed to use it anymore, so now my mixer is gone and I cant even use the new one anymore

AITA for feeding my sons vegan friend meat?,14593,Not the A-hole,4439,ct5tg1,1566362527.0,"Hey guys, short time lurker first time poster, I'm not one to really do this but I'm genuinely wondering if I'm in the wrong.


So my son had a friend over for dinner the other night. For context, they're both 13, and the friends parents are vegan.


I don't know anything about vegan food and don't have many vegetables I normally cook - pretty much all I ever make for vegetable sides is buttered corn, brocolli and cheese, brown sugar carrots, or mixed veggies.


Well, normally his friend isn't over for dinner, but this night his parents weren't able to pick him up until late so asked if he could eat dinner with us. We said of course, and they reminded us that they are vegan so he'd need a vegan friendly dish. We told them we don't really have anything we could make vegan, but we could find some small things to give him until they picked him up and they said to just make whatever we were going to make ourselves and leave out the animal products.


Well, that night was meatloaf night. With homemade mashed potatoes (lots of butter) and buttered corn. I offered to make him some roasted carrots and potato wedges, but he said he'd actually like to eat what we were eating and that it looked good, and that he usually eats meat at school anyways. So, we just made him the same plate as ours. 


Well when his parents asked him what he had for dinner and he told them, they were PISSED. They said we're a bad influence and turning him against veganism?? Even though it was HIS choice to eat our dinner rather than me making him some small sides. Apparently now he's also no longer allowed to hang out with our son. Our son is heartbroken, me and my husband are pretty upset that they're trying to end our kids friendship over this, and our friends are kind of split. Some people say that their son is old enough to make his own decision on if he's vegan or not, some think I should of done as the parents asked and made him something vegan. I also think that at his age, it's his choice to eat animal products or not, and if he asks me for some I'm not going to say no.

She does not pay for any of my bills. I pay for my own tuition, books, food, gas, car insurance, etc. This is not new.

My younger brother also lives with us (19) and just works BUT does not pay any rent. In fact my mother gives him money. It's like any money I give my mother goes directly to my other siblings and it's a point of contention. To make matters worse, she not only lies about my brother paying rent and not giving him money.

My mother discreetly dropped me off her work insurance plan. I only found out when I called her job up to get a new health insurance card and they told me that I was no longer on the plan anymore. That actually hurt that she did that. She is under financial stress right now because she is also supporting my loser sister, her baby daddy and they just had a kid.

In the past, I would give her T-1098 which is the tax form for college. It was of no value to me because I was listed as a dependent (which was required to get health insurance under her job). Basically she would say that she paid for all of my tuition and books so she could get a bigger refund and more credits on her tax return even though I was the one who personally paid for all of my college expenses.

She asked me for my T-1098 from 2019 and I refused to give it to her. Since she kicked me off her insurance because she couldn't afford it (and didn't bother telling she did that), I am now deemed an independent and I am filing my taxes as such. She blew up at me saying that things are financially tight and tried modifying our rental agreement to where she would claim my college expenses as her own. I won't budge. I would actually get a big enough refund to cover next semester's tuition.

EDIT: My mother's employer pays 100% of her insurance and like 50% for dependents. She had the high-end plan. It's not ""free."" I ended up getting insurance through my part-time job, which costs me $100 a month.

AITA for grilling my sons new girlfriend and telling him I don’t approve?,14534,Asshole,1194,gyztaf,1591653501.0,"My son (m20) has been dating a girl he goes to university with for about 6 months now. She’s an international student from New Zealand, but has family here so is staying with them during covid-19. Due to lockdown restrictions and such, we hadn’t met her until a couple nights ago, when I invited her over for dinner with my family. We had FaceTimed a few times but not spoken a lot. 

My husband and I are very Catholic and traditional, but spent a lot of our 20s travelling the world, including New Zealand. We visited her hometown so asked her a few questions about it which she happily answered, but when I asked about her Maori heritage and family, became quite uncomfortable and said she didn’t know a whole lot about it which I find hard to believe. We asked her if she was religious, she laughed and said no. We asked her about her degree which she seemed very passionate about, but it’s a fashion degree which isn’t exactly going to get her very far, in comparison to my son who is a law student. 

It’s clear she loves my son and it’s mutual, and my other children adored her, but I don’t think she’s the right fit for my son. Her parents were both 16 when they had her, and she’s very open with the fact that they have a strong dislike for each other and haven’t spoken since she was 6 months old. She also seems to have a bizarre relationship with each of her parents. 

After dinner she went and played monopoly with my daughters and sons, and made a couple crude jokes, as well as laughing at my son, her boyfriend, when he lost. My son asked me if she could stay, and I said she could as long as she slept in a separate room which he said was ridiculous as they’re both 20 and are living together next year. She decided to leave as she “didn’t feel welcome”. 

After she left I told my son I didn’t approve and that I could set him up with a nice girl from my church if he preferred but he said he loves her and was furious I would even suggest it. My other son, who’s 16, heard me and said he really liked her. My husband said that even if I felt like that, I shouldn’t vocalise it because it’s clear my son loves her.

AITA for stealing my friends bird,14499,Not the A-hole,1935,d75q2g,1569067083.0,"I love birds, and I'm the proud owner of 2 budgies. I've had them for about a year and a half. When I first got them, my friend fell in love decided she wanted one of her own.

She then proceeded to spend the least amount of money she could on a cage and decorated it with minimal accessories. She got the bird, and while she seemed to like it at first, she basically ignored it after a month. 

Every time I went over to her house, I told her that it needed more attention. It just sat in the corner all day, silent, occasionally gnawing at the only toy in the cage, which was shredded and worn within the first couple of months. Its food and water were probably only changed once a week. It was living above a mountain of poop because she never changed the tray.

I told her repeatedly that she was neglecting her bird. And despite promising to do better, she never did. 

I asked her if I could have it. She got really upset with me, saying that she had paid for it so she had the right to do what she wanted with it. 

I felt really horrible every time I went over there. I decided I wanted to steal it. I felt like I could give it a better life. It could even make friends with my 2 birds. I just couldn't let it live the rest of its life unhappy in the corner of a cage, doing nothing. 

So I did it. She was in the bathroom, and I took a shoe box I had hidden in my backpack and got the bird in. It was scared at first, but it calmed down in the box. I left without even saying goodbye. 

Soon after I got a phone call which basically consisted of her yelling at me for a long while. I said that I'd give back her bird if she bought it a bigger cage, more toys, and promised to take better care of it. She once again used the argument of, ""Its my bird, I can do what I want with it.""

I took it home, where it livened up in the presence of my 2 other birds. It began chirping for the first time I had ever heard. It seemed very happy. 

This was all 3 days ago. My friend is still extremely pissed at me for not giving her bird back and is saying I'm being an asshole. So Reddit, AITA?

UPDATE: Wow, I was not expecting this to get so huge. 

I honestly went into this thinking I was going to keep the bird for probably 1 day or something before she profusely apologized and vowed to change her ways. She didn't. Like I said, I would have given it back if she had. 

I guess I just figured that she needed something drastic to snap her into the reality that she was neglecting her bird. Which now, after reading the comments, I understand was a pretty immature way of handling things. 

Today I offered her $50 as reimbursement, which was double what she bought the bird for. She took it and is letting me keep the bird. But she still hates me. Honestly, at this point, I couldn't care less. The bird is safe. That's all that matters.

I think I could've handled it better, but I don't regret my choices. Thanks for the advice, support, and reality checks, everyone.",False,1569122960.0,2019-09-21 04:58:03

I got home a few days ago and wanted to give everyone an update. The rest of the week was pretty much the three of us again, except for one other night where we were alone. So essentially in a week we only had two nights out together (I slept in her house so we spent nights alone anyway but I mean going out alone without third wheel).

I decided to do what a lot of you were suggesting and I confronted the other guy about wtf was going on. I guess something didn't feel right and my gut was telling me I should probably talk to him because I felt she was lying. So I went out on a ""walk to the shops"" and ended up at the guy's hotel and room.

Straight up asked him what's going on, it was incredibly awkward but we ended up having a good conversation about her and he basically was told the same as I was. Except she lied and said I purposely told her I couldn't afford a room and she ""had to offer me her place"". This isn't true, she offered me her place from the get-go and I never insinuated I wouldn't get a hotel room. She told him she liked him, was incredibly flirtatious with him too and they actually took it much farther than we did. They had a lot of phone sex, he had her nudes (he didn't show me out of respect for her), and they cammed a lot. A lot more than she did with me. I felt heartbroken, still do but I'm feeling better. On this trip alone they actually had sex when she was at his room, he confirmed it with a text she sent him when she left to go out with me. He does really like her, I'm not sure if she likes him back but she did sleep with him so maybe, She never did strike me as that type of person yet here we are, I told him he could have her.

So yeah. In essence, she lied a lot. She told me she really liked me, told him she doesn't like me at all. Was incredibly flirty with both of us and leading us both on. She told him she didn't want me at her house yet totally invited me to stay there. She told me she didn't like him, he's just a friend visiting, but then turns out she's had a sexual relationship with him for months and they even slept together while I was also there. It's shit.

Shit update and it's 100% what you lot expected and were telling me was gonna happen. Turns out I am really fucking stupid however I'm working on it and you can bet I won't make the same mistake again.

AITA for outing something private about an ex on social media?,14441,Not the A-hole,1484,gpjcm7,1590323115.0,"We dated 15 years ago and have remained friends this whole time. Over the years, his political view points have changed drastically from what they used to be. He's now very heavily right-wing, which is fine. It doesn't interfere with our friendship really at all. We just don't bother to argue about the things we disagree on.

Lately, his Facebook posts have very aggressively focused in on the subject of abortion. I think he needs to have more grace on the subject because he pushed me to get an abortion when I got pregnant by him as a teenager. I absolutely believe it was the best decision but at the time, I was so torn and scared and had no idea what I wanted to do and he pushed it.

Nowadays, he has absolutely no tolerance on the subject at all. He digs his heels in and says that anyone who would make that decision is a murderer - no matter what their circumstance is. I know that people grow up and change their views but he's just so extremely against things that he's benefitted from in the past. Another example is how adamantly he believes that state assistance programs need to be completely abolished... Even though those are the programs that fed, clothed, and housed him his entire life. It just rubs me the wrong way. 

Anyway, he was berating people on this particular thread about what an abhorrent choice it was to terminate a pregnancy. Even belittling people on his thread who were sharing their own personal stories. 

I ended up commenting something along the lines of ""your comments here are really shocking considering the fact that you sang a very different tune when you got me pregnant as a teenager....""

He ended up deleting the whole thread and messaged me about how that was completely different and very personal and that I shouldn't be spewing his private history all over the place. 

I apologized because it did feel wrong but now I'm wondering if I'm actually the asshole given how he was acting toward people who have made the same decision as himself..

We had two sons together, J who is 14 and M who is 16. 

My wife passed extremely unexpectedly a month ago and it absolutely shattered our world. I feel so alone and have even started going to counseling to help with getting over her. 

Here is the hard part. Two nights ago I decided to go through my wife’s cell phone to read our text messages and look at some photos she had taken I never got sent. That’s when I found the messages after I decided to look through her browser history. 

Messages to men in their 60’s sending dirty photos she had sent me. Nights she told me she was visiting her sister, she was actually out with these men doing god knows what for money. I don’t want to get into to much detail with how filthy some of they were, but I cannot believe she could have done this to me. I suspected nothing. Ever. 

My sons are obviously still crushed and always talking up their mother and how sweet, amazing she is. How much they miss her love and honesty. I cannot see her as the woman I thought I knew and I am torn on what to do. On one hand, I don’t want to make this passing harder for them and hinder their thoughts about their mother but on another hand I feel they are old enough to know the truth.

AITA for skipping my own wedding to see my dying grandma?,14418,Not the A-hole,3133,cisjdx,1564323711.0,"This actually happened about 5 months ago, but since my girlfriend (no longer engaged) refuses to let it go, and I honestly don’t think I’m in the wrong, I figured I’d ask for an outside opinion.

My girlfriend (then fiancée) were engaged to be married about 5 months ago. 

Now, my biological mother is a useless drug addict that I’ve never cared for nor wished to pursue a relationship with. She left me with my grandma and I was raised by her since birth. I have always and will always consider my grandma my real “mother”  because she raised me and cared for me all my life.

About a year ago, we (me and my uncles) had to put grandma in a care home. This was a hard decision to make, but we simply didn’t have the means to care for her properly anymore even with her carer’s help. She had a lot of age related health issues as well as dementia. 

Fast forward to my wedding, a few days beforehand we get a call from the care home saying grandma’s condition was deteriorating rapidly and she most likely would pass away in the next day or so. My uncles and I immediately went down there and spent the entire time by her side. 

She doesn’t pass as soon as expected and it extends up until the day of my wedding. I called my fiancée multiple times and explained we had to postpone the wedding. Not only was I not in the best state of mind (again, she’s my mother to me) but I needed to be by her side when she passed. I felt sick at the idea of not being there when I could.

My fiancée was extremely (to put it mildly) opposed to this and insisted I get ready as soon as possible. She obviously did not want months of planning to go to waste, and I understand that it definitely sucks. She also said there was no point in me being there since she won’t even know I’m there due to her dementia. I understand why it might seem like that to her, but to me it didn’t matter if she realised I was there or not. I just felt I had to be there with my uncles. 

She ended up passing the night of my wedding. My fiancée didn’t talk to me for roughly two weeks before we finally began patching things up. She said I was completely assholish to her and humiliated her by not showing up. She thinks that as my fiancée she should take top priority no matter what. My opinion is that weddings can be rescheduled (albeit costly) and being with my grandma when she passed was more important.

So yeah that’s the back story. We have both agreed to go with the majority judgement given here and move on from it. Will answer questions when possible but will refrain from defending myself in order to be fair to my GF.",False,False,2019-07-28 07:21:51

His father threw a huge tantrum about it and screamed horrible things at him (my son let me overhear a phone conversation where he called him a faggot and said he was obligated to have biological children). I don't really know all that happened because my son didn't want to tell me, but I was scared for his safety so when he didn't want to see his dad anymore I agreed. He was obviously devastated.

He obviously didn't take that well and tried to get a custody agreement change but the judge didn't have any of it. My son blocked him on all social media and I think on whatsapp too so he probably doesn't have a way to him anymore so he's trying to communicate with him through me. Now, he told me he is sorry and he ""wants things to go back to how they were"". I think my son is ready to forgive him as he told me he wanted an apology and I told his father so. I told him to write a letter with an apology and he got back to me with a lengthy text message mostly whining that he lost his son and how sad he is about it. No expression of regret whatsoever. I let my son read it, but I sort of regret doing that because it just hurt him more. He still doesn't want to talk or see his father.

In the last two weeks, since the current global crisis has aggravated I've been getting lots of messages from him telling me how much he's suffering from not seeing his son, etc. I believe that he's genuinely sorry for what he did but he's too prideful to apologize to a child.

He said he wasn’t comfortable being in a relationship where the female doesn’t have a traditional role in the household and going forward, he expects me to resume the cleaning and cooking. 
So I broke up with him and he didn’t believe me. So I moved my stuff out back to my mom’s today while he was at work and took the dogs (not that he ever looked after them). Thank you people of reddit! You have really helped me see my worth and what I was blind to. Thank you 


My boyfriend (25M) and myself (22F) have been living together for about a year. Dating for 4 years. We have a little 3 bedroom house with our 2 doggos and both work full time. I actually work more hours than he does, and my job is more physically demanding than his (I love my job). My issue is, he never helps me with housework. Ever. I have to beg him to help me. He won’t even take the trash out unless I literally nag him. I often come home later than him, and the dishes haven’t been done/put away, the dogs haven’t been fed or their area cleaned up, his hair is all over the sink from shaving etc! He makes a coffee and leaves the mug in his office for 3 days until I go in there and get it. He puts his dirty laundry next to the bed instead of the washer or the hamper. He never contributes to the laundry, so I do that. I also cook, and he doesn’t even bother to offer to help clean up afterward. He doesn’t help with ANYTHING unless I fully beg him, and at that point, he complains and says I’m annoying and high maintenance. My final straw was 2 days ago when he took a massive shit and didn’t scrub the toilet after. It was disgusting. He didn’t see the problem (?!?!?!) So I told him if he wasn’t going to help me with housework and make things more equal, then I was going to stop completely. He didn’t see the issue. 2.5 days later and the house is so yuck. It smells. The dishes have been piling up this whole time. I haven’t done his laundry so he had no clean clothes for work. I didn’t vacuum or clean the bathroom so the floor is super yuck and bathroom is pretty gross too lol. When I got home tonight, I happily poured myself a wine and watched some Netflix in bed. He got angry at me and demanded that I help him clean up. I said no, he is more than welcome to do it and he did. He cleaned the entire house and is now not speaking to me. He said what I did was disgusting, I could have made him sick and I made him late for work by not having his clothes washed and ironed. He also said he is very sore and tired from cleaning for hours and is angry because he wanted to play Xbox. He’s been bitching about me to his friends, saying he thinks he can’t be with me anymore. I’m 99% sure he didn’t know I was listening.

AITA For Never Telling My Son About The Existance Of His Twin Brother,14386,Asshole,3574,cgd82t,1563831014.0,"My 4 year old son Jon is the one of the twins I had. My other son was mishandled by a nurse and passed away shortly after birth, it was an unfortunate accident. 


Me and my husband left our unnamed son with the hospital and did not press charges against the nurse, much to our parents'(both his and mine) displeasure. Our reason was that we had no time nor energy to deal with them, our priority was to look after Jon, who was much smaller than his twin and needed more attention.


While growing up, despite never being mentioned, Jon seemed to know that he once had a brother. He told us his made-up stories that he had about brothers, he played roles about brothers with his toys, and he even asked us to give him an older brother.


Initially, me and my husband made a promise that we would never tell Jon about his unnamed brother, but now he wants to tell Jon about it when he is older. It must have been the guilt that we have never acknowledged our unnamed son's existence, even though they are both our sons. 


I am still still standing firm to our promise. I believe that we should not dwell on the past and move on. Jon is my son and my little bundle of joy, I would never want him to know the sorrow of losing his brother. I want to convince him that his brother is just a fragment of his imagination.


Now both my parents, my husband's parents and my husband is calling me cold blooded. They want so much to included a deceased brother into Jon's life. He is still little, so it wouldn't be now, but they intended to tell him one day and I cannot stop them. However, I will still try to convince them while there is  time, he needs no such negativity from the past.

AITA for getting my neighbors’ fire pit shut down?,14362,Not the A-hole,1215,gogf0s,1590169892.0,"My husband and I are new homeowners and moved into our first home a little less than a year ago. 

We’ve had a rocky relationship with one of our neighbors from the start, an older couple— the husband is pretty chill and kind to us but the wife has been confrontational and made sure when we moved in that we knew exactly where our property ends and theirs begins. We’re in a city and our lots are about 2000 sqft each so we’re talking a matter of inches that she does not want us crossing. When we moved in, other neighbors on the street welcomed us and also warned us about her attitude and nastiness. Basically the point being that honestly I am intimidated by my neighbors and do not want to confront them directly. 

They have a fire pit in their backyard that is roughly 20 feet from our house. The weather has been getting nicer so they have been using it for recreational use— just to have a fire going while sitting outside and chatting. Naturally being so close, the smoke comes right into our home so we can’t open windows and we can’t be outside in our own yard without being covered in smoke. It has even set off the smoke detectors in our house if any window is opened a crack. 

I checked our local laws and any fire pits require a permit and must be 75 ft away from any structure (which is impossible considering the size of our houses and our small yards), and can only be operated from January to May 1st. 

I called the non-emergency line of fire department yesterday (anonymously) and within 5 minutes they were there and it was put out. I plan to call the non-emergency number whenever their smoke gets into our house/yard. According to local laws they will probably be fined and prohibited from having it entirely if there are multiple complaints. 

WIBTA for continuing to call the fire department when this happens again to get my neighbors’ recreational fire pit shut down?

EDIT: I called the fire department office number specifically listed for questions/concerns/complaints on outdoor burning. I didn’t call 911 or emergency fire services. They sent a couple of guys over to speak with them, without a truck.

EDIT 2: Edited again to make it clearer that *no emergency services were used.* My fire department has a non-emergency number specifically on their website to call about fire pits and outdoor burning. 

Also I’m not sure why there are so many comments claiming that I’m lying about the fire alarms going off. It’s happened at least 3-4 times. We’re talking big fires with a lot of smoke in a very dense neighborhood, not a little grill.

I know the rules say this is not an advice forum but yes I do have a whole lot of anxiety over talking to them so if anyone can message me constructive tips on how to gain confidence and stand my ground when talking to her I’d appreciate it :)

FINAL EDIT: Wasn’t expecting 1000+ comments and can’t keep up with them all, but thank you for your input! To answer a couple common questions: yes, our properties really are that small and close (exactly 7ft from the side of our house to their fence, and the fire pit is just a few more feet back) and yes, I would want the fires to stop even if they were nice neighbors— I almost lost my childhood home to fire so I’m super paranoid over smoke and fire being so close to my house. 

Yesterday’s fire was the biggest and smokiest one they had yet so I was kind of in a small panic when I called the non-emergency line and only after the fact have been reflecting and agonizing if I’m an AH for it. General consensus seems to be NTA even though I’m a pussy for being scared of an old lady but I’ll probably talk to the husband at some point if he’s outside alone.",False,1590179832.0,2020-05-22 10:51:32

They bought my younger brother (let's call him brandon) a phone recently and since they don't know anything about parental controls, my mom stays concerned about what he uses it for.

Tbh, he's just a lot into games and music and not a lot else. 

This morning, my mom and I were having breakfast when she asked if Brandon's gmail is logged into my dad's phone too. I said he might've used dad's phone to check his inbox or whatever, no biggie. Mom then said Brandon's been watching ""dirty stuff"" because she saw it in his youtube history. 

I rolled my eyes bc I know it's none of my business but I'd have to deal with it because it's a big deal for mom.

I checked if Brandon's gmail was logged into my dad's phone that she so confidently claimed, it wasn't. My dad just has the same profile picture for no apparent reason. 

I said nothing for a while but she said she'll have to speak to my brother about this. This was when I decided to intervene. I told her she saw dad's youtube history and not my brother's. She was noticeably embarrassed. Called me in her room after a while and said I shouldn't walk around in short clothes or be braless around the house bc my brother's ""growing up""

Two days later one of the kids mothers comes by and begs me to drop the charges. She says her son is the first one in the family to go to college and that he has a scholarship and that if the university finds out they will rescind their offer, and the scholarship.

I told her I am sorry but I already have made up my mind. Since then people in the community have treated me much worse I believe she probably told a lot of people I don’t know her version of events.

  She has started transitioning & wearing male clothing and wants us to start referring to her using male pronouns instead of female. I have no problem with him being transgender however my other girlfriends and I don't feel comfortable including him in our night outs once he's done transitioning.



   We don't feel it's appropriate anymore because it's, well, girls' night out. I mentioned this to my bf and he says it's transphobic to exclude him but we don't feel comfortable with him anymore and I think our feelings overtake his. Plus in my defense if excluding him is transphobic then girls' night outs are sexist because they exclude men. I don't think we're doing anything wrong because my safety overtakes his feelings.

"AITA for telling my sister a ""wedding tattoo"" is a curse (even though I have one), and now the curse is coming true?",14276,Not the A-hole,760,ddvaiq,1570347396.0,"My partner and I are in our 30s and we live in a country where gay marriage is illegal. We got engaged years ago knowing we wouldn't be able to marry, but we set a ""wedding"" date and had a party for friends and family. Instead of an actual ceremony, we got matching tattoos. We had been together 7 years when that happened, and it's been another 6 years since then.

Anyway, my sister has been with her husband for just under 2 years. They got engaged almost as soon as they started dating, and they married 3 months ago. However, they're both not into wearing rings, so my sister suggested to her husband to get tattoos instead.

I jokingly told her that it's a curse (that getting a tattoo of a boyfriend/husband/partner's name will result in a break-up) and she said that my relationship is still going strong despite the curse. I said yeah, but we were together for 7 years when we got the tattoos, and btw we didn't tattoo each other's names but something else (a picture of a memory we have together), whereas she was going for straight-up ""Samuel <3 21.6.19"" in huge thick letters across her wrist. I told her not to do it, and to just wear her wedding band on a necklace or something, but she told me to piss off, and did it anyway.

Fast forward, her marriage is falling apart. Nothing happened, they just seem to be realizing they're not a good fit, and it's only a question of time when they'll divorce. They don't even live together anymore, he moved out 3 weeks into their marriage.

Now, my sister is blaming me for subconsciously influencing her and making her marriage fail. She thinks that me saying it was a curse subconsciously made her act towards her husband in a certain way that resulted in him being pushed away and not loving her anymore. I've never heard of something like this before. I very much doubt I have this superpower of destroying relationships. But my sister is currently going around telling our relatives I'm the asshole that ruined her marriage.

AITA for Ditching my Cousin's Baby Shower and Taking the Food Away from the Party?,14276,Not the A-hole,1416,dyp191,1574219384.0,"UPDATE: My Dad heard the whole thing and told my mother about it, who was working in the kitchen. They both (politely) excused themselves afterwards and drove over to my place to talk about it. My Dad drove my half of the groceries to my cousin's place and then came back. There's now a massive feud on our family WhatsApp with two groups:

1) Family who are sticking up for me and telling other people to stop provoking me (mostly older relatives).

2) People who are saying I'm an asshole (mostly the younger generation).

&#x200B;

My cousin and her boyfriend (soon-to-be-married) were having their baby shower and the whole family was invited to the party. My mother and aunts love to cook so they wanted to gather the ingredients and make a huge dinner themselves. I drove my car and my father drove his, and we basically pushed the shopping carts along and got our credit cards ready while the women shoveled everything they wanted into the carriages.

We finally got everything to my cousin's place and we started off-loading my Dad's car first. While I was inside, I got a chance to say hi to my cousin to congratulate her on her baby shower. The conversation started off light, but took a weird turn. She asked me how my parents raised me, and specific details like if they grounded me, what kinds of punishment they used, what I did when I was little and what regrets I had as a kid that I would change. I thought they were trying to learn how to raise their child, but it was weird because I'm a single guy. They would've been better off asking my parents about these things.

Here's where things get dark. I ask my cousin why she's asking me all this, and she says, ""I just want to raise my baby better than you,"" That made no sense because I never raised any babies. The vibe I got was definitely that it was an insult but on the off-chance she wasn't intentionally being rude, I just laughed it off and said, ""Well I'm no Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs, but I do alright for,"" I assumed she meant that she wanted to raise her baby to be better than me, which is fine since parents want the world for their kids.

Nope, she just kept going. ""Well that's true. Did your parents ever think you'd turn out this way?""

I said, ""Well I think they just wanted me to be happy,""

Her, ""Are you?""

Me, ""Well I'm definitely happy for you, congratulations!"" (I'm trying reaaaaaaally hard to steer things away from me).

Her, ""Thanks. Do you ever plan on having kids?""

Me, ""I just gotta find the right person, but until then I'm gonna enjoy life as is. There's no need to stress out wanting something else and taking what we have for granted.""

Her, ""Sure... Well I'm younger than you and I already have a family. Don't wait too long... or else you might ending up dying alone,"" I ask her directly what she meant. She just laughs, shrugs, and leaves. I her again and she says, ""Don't get angry at me, you're the one who refuses to go out and meet people. If you bothered to leave your house every once in a while maybe you'd have a family of your own by now. I just don't want my baby to end up like you,""

Everyone within earshot was dead-silent. I just stared at her for who knows how long and she just ends up rubbing her belly and waddling away.

AITA for not letting my sister have one of my eggs?,14258,Not the A-hole,2336,f09w7t,1581107784.0,"When I was in my mid-twenties, I froze some eggs. We ended up freezing 10 eggs. I was lucky enough that my job covered part of the costs. 

Fast forward: when my husband and I were ready to get pregnant, we ended up just getting pregnant naturally (I am currently 35, I had my baby a year ago). We do want two more children, so we will likely use a few of the eggs. 

My sister (30) had one kid in her teens (my 12 year old niece) and has recently gotten married. She and her husband have been together for less than six months. Even though she was young, my sisters first pregnancy was a struggle. She has been told that she probably will not be able to have another baby. 


Now, she and her new husband are asking me if they can have one or two of my stored eggs. I instantly told her no, I would feel very weird about it. 

I then softened my stance, and told her that if she paid me a substantial amount of money, I would let her have two eggs. I have been paying $70 a month for the past nine years to store them and paid a hefty fine for the process of removal. I gave her a price of $5,000. I admit that this is mostly done to dissuade her from asking me. 

She’s really torn up, and blaming me for not being able to “enjoy sharing a child with her husband”. I told her to find a donor egg, and she would be able to do that. She says she wants a baby that is related by blood (my baby??). 
I also told her, frankly, that if she can’t afford 5K for the egg, she can’t afford another baby. Before she got married, she was constantly asking me for money. 

She has now gone on to whine to any family member or friend in ear shot about how much of a horrible sister I am. My parents are begging me to help my sister start a family, and are saying that if her new husband leaves her because he wants kids, it will be my fault. Other people are even coming out of the woodwork to shame me for not giving her the eggs.

"AITA for not wanting to ""return the favour"" by having 3 babies?",14249,Not the A-hole,2600,fxl4rt,1586432340.0,"I'm going to preface this by saying I don't think I'm TA, and neither does my wife, but my in laws all think we are hypocrites and we want to see the other side of this and hopefully use that to figure out a way forward.

My wife and I are both women. My wife and I want kids, and we would like it if they could be related to us, but obviously there's an issue there as far as making babies goes. We were considering adoption when my wife suggested asking her older brother to donate sperm to us. I know this sounds batshit crazy but they're siblings, so they look a lot alike and they're really close, and this is the closest we could possibly get to having a child that's biologically both of ours. The brother said he'd be willing to donate when we're ready and can't wait to be an uncle.

Since the brother agreed to this he and his wife have found out that his wife can't have kids. Recently the brother told us he wants to renegotiate the sperm donor situation. In short, he wants to make 5 babies with me. Again, I know how this sounds, and I wish this was fake. He and his wife want 3 kids, me and my wife want 2. He wants me to go through 5 pregnancies, and he'll provide the sperm for each one, so biologically all 5 kids will be full siblings, but raised as cousins.

We get how big a favour he'd be doing us by donating, and we were honestly thrilled when he agreed, but the thing is the amount of time he'd spend creating 5 babies is about an hour or so, and the amount of time I'd spend is nearly 4 years (without recovery time). I was fine with 2 lots of 9 months when I was keeping the babies, but the idea of carrying those 2 plus 3 additional pregnancies where I didn't keep the babies is a whole other thing.

When they asked my wife and I said no. They asked why not, and our response was that he was asking me to go through 3 more pregnancies on top of the 2 we'd agreed on. He then said that if we weren't willing to give him children, he wouldn't do the same for us. We said that was his right to change his mind, but he was asking too much from us.

So now no one is having biological children. My wife and I were seriously considering adoption before the brother suggestion ever came up, and we do still want to try that, so at the end of the day we'd be just as happy to have a non biological child as a biological one, however the brother, who doesn't want to adopt, has told their mother who has told the extended family, and it appears that just about everyone in my wife's family believes that we should agree to it and ""return the favour"", so basically if he gives us children then I should do the same for him, and by the time I'm done everyone has their desired number of biological babies. The brother and his wife are similarly pressuring us, telling us they'd give us children so why won't we give them kids, and that the two things are the same, and called us hypocrites because we'd have kids with their help but won't help them have kids.

Like I said at the start, my wife and I believe we're in the right, but we want to hear if we actually are or not and what the other perspective might be in order to know how to proceed.

AITA?

Info: neither wife in this scenario (my wife or his) is able to produce viable eggs or carry to term, so some form of IVF/surrogacy wouldn't be possible involving either of them, and I'm basically the only chance at biological children for any of us. The brother and his wife can't afford to pay a surrogate. My wife and I are going back to adoption as our preferred route in the hopes that this will stop any further tension.

We have tried to negotiate the number of kids but they want exactly 3 kids, and they want them all to be full siblings because they're worried if I gave them one child with the brother's sperm and they adopted the rest then they'd subconsciously prefer the one who was related to the brother.

To clarify: of the 2 biological requirements of creating children - producing viable eggs and carrying to term - I am the only woman in this scenario that can do both, while my wife and my brother in law's wife can't do either. The only people in this situation capable of having children are myself and my wife's brother.

AITA for not wanting to quit my job to look after a baby,14219,Not the A-hole,1114,gv6abu,1591129131.0,"Background

My boyfriend (23, M) and I (23, M) met at university about 4 years ago and have been together for about 3.5 years. After university, I moved back to my home city to get a job whereas he stayed in the city we met as he had a placement that offered him a job once he graduated. We live about an hour apart. We make it work because we see each other on weekends, and I take time off in the school holidays etc.

I work as a PA for one of the partners in a pretty decent sized law firm and have been here since I graduated about 2.5 years ago and he works in a primary school. I love my job - I get to travel, great benefits and bonuses and it’s a workplace where everyone knows each other and gets along great. I would consider my boss a friend outside of work since we often go out in groups together. 

So then, we were talking about what we wanted our future together to look like – when and where we’d move in, a pet - things like that. He mentioned children at some point (not necessarily now but before he turned 30). I have never been too bothered about kids and he knows this. I would have children, but it’s never been a must (for lack of better wording). Maybe it’s because I'm the youngest in my family so I never grew up with babies or younger children around me or maybe it’s because I'm only in my 20s and haven't really thought about it in that much detail.

He then said that (not word for word) 'You would have to start getting used to being around a baby since you're going to be the one looking after it throughout the day'. I was taken aback, never had a said I wanted to be a stay at home parent or shown any interest in doing that. So, I told him that. I said I wasn't going to give up my job to be a stay at home parent. I said if it ever came to children, I would take the allowed paternity time off to bond etc with the baby, but I wouldn't be quitting my job. He went off on one saying how I was only a PA (who makes more than him WITHOUT the bonuses) whereas he was a teacher, shaping the minds of young children and furthering their education. How I was unloving and a monster for not willing to put a baby first and how it would feel unloved if we just had our parents look after it. I asked why he wouldn't do it and he couldn't answer so went back to shouting and name-calling.

My argument was that children were never a be-all-or-end-all part of my life and while I would love the baby, I would not put my career on hold. My life (to me) is pretty fulfilled as it is as I have a great family, I've got nieces and nephews who I love and spend time with but it’s nice I get to hand them back to my cousins at the end of the day/weekend. Another point I made was how willing would he be to come and take over from me on an evening when he had been around 30 young children all day and then coming home to one.

Also, when she has her kid here, numerous people come over to our office to chat and coddle the kid and ""meet"" the kid and baby talk the kid and it's really disturbing when you're trying to concentrate on writing or creating graphics for a project.

AITA for saying I don't want a car with strings attached; I'd rather save for my own car.,14187,Not the A-hole,2827,emv42p,1578710122.0,"I am 16f and I just passed my driver's license test. My parents had been saying for a while that they'd get me a car when I passed the test, and I passed on the first try! 

My parents sat me down and said that the car would come with some restrictions and expectations...

- I would pay for my insurance and gas, and tolls, with money from my part time job. (I'd be on their insurance but I'd pay my part)

- I would drive my siblings ( 14m 11m ) to school, home from soccer and robotics club, etc.

- I would run family errands twice a month. 

- I would be responsible for car maintenance and cleaning.

- I would have my car privileges suspended if I got a speeding ticket, other moving violation, or was seen driving unsafely

- I would not drive more than one friend at a time as they might be a distraction.

- The car was to stay at home as a family car / learner car for my brothers when I go to college

Afterwards, I thought through all that, and realized I'd basically be paying a lot of my own money to be a driver for my brothers all the time. And I wouldn't even be able to use my car for much of what Id want to use it for. Like doing things with friends. And I wouldn't have a car for college.

So I thought on it. I made a budget of how much I'd spend a month on maintenance, gas, tolls, cleaning, insurance, etc... Versus how much I was making at my job. 

Then I figured how long it would take for me to save up and buy my own car, and still be budgeting for all the monthly costs. And I figured that if I put my savings into a car fund and also saved for six to eight months, If be able to afford my own car and all its costs.

I thought that would be a much better choice; I'd have a car to take to college and I wouldn't have to be the chauffeur to my brothers every day. 

So yesterday I told my parents ""No thanks; I'd rather keep working and save up for a car I can totally own. I've worked out a budget and think it will take under 8 months."" 

I honestly thought my parents would be OK with it; they value budgeting and personal responsibility a lot so I thought they might even be proud of me making this my goal. But they had a lot of problems with it, that I'll just summarize here

1. They want me to drive my brothers so my mom and dad don't have to any more.

2. They think the sort of car I can afford (a mid 2000s sedan like a Honda Civic or Toyota Camry) would be a lot less safe than what they were planning on getting. (A new Hyundai SUV)

3. The car is not just for me, it will be a third family car for when my brothers learn to drive too.

I feel like that's really unfair, that they won't let me save for my own car instead. It's like they've decided they're gonna give me something I don't even want, and I don't have a choice in it.

I’m sitting there having a good laugh with a mate through text and the content wasn’t exactly PG I guess and I could see her looking at  my messages in the corner of my eye so I did try to move the phone out of sight so she wouldn’t get offended but It was too late she advised me that I shouldn’t bother moving it out of her sight because she had already read it and called me a disgusting millennial and that I should be ashamed of my language (I’m 26 next month) not exactly that young....I looked at her and said how about you mind your own fucking business!

I've gotten it a few times and it's so hard to get rid of, my hair is thick and curly. My sister's are also so gross, they won't be careful what brushes or hats or scarves they use, they'll lay down on anything, even the shared sofas or sometimes my bed with it. It's fucking nasty. 

My parents get us shampoos and try to comb out my sisters hair, I do the treatment on my own, but it just won't go away. Even now when my sisters aren't even going to school anymore, lice is back and I'm so done. Each time they promise it's gone, it isn't, and I'm so fed up.

I took my dad's hair clippers when the rest of the family had gone for a hike and gave myself a buzz cut, I mainly did it because I am so grossed out by this lice thing.

But I also think that it's gonna be a long time till I'll be seen by anyone; schools cancelled for the year and only restarts in September now. So who cares how I look?

I think I look badass for the record, but I know short hair on women isn't a super common look and a lot of people don't like it.

My parents were so mad, calling me dramatic, impulsive, stupid, etc.

They also found out I put a picture on Instagram saying I'd buzzed my hair, and mentioning it was because I was stuck in a house with sister's who couldn't stop spreading lice, and I'd needed a new look anyway. And they were so mad I was publicly bringing shame to the family's reputation.

They are so mad that I did it because I'm supposed to get a job this summer, whenever businesses open again, and I'm ruining my chance of getting a job with that haircut

Around 6 months ago a friend on my father's lost his job and because of his age (mid 50s) he was having trouble finding other work so I was asked to give him a job, so I did because i knew the guy had a lot of experience in the area. 
As soon as he started I noticed him either not listening to me or just rolling his eyes when ever I took charge and he would occasionally make comments like ""I know what I'm doing"" and ""I've been doing this longer then you. But I ignored this because I figured it must be hard for him to be taking orders from someone almost half his age so I mostly ignored it...until yesterday.
Yesterday I was having a few issues with one of our clients (nothing major we just couldn't decide on the best way to procide with the job) and he suddenly comes out with 
""Achually can I just talk to your boss so I can make sure theres no misunderstandings?"" 
So I slightly surprised respond with 
""Oh sorry if I never made it clear but I'm the manager""
And his face instantly turned in to a glare and he said 
""Common kid dont try and pull that I'm fully aware that hes the manager"" and he pointed straight to my father's friend 
At this point I ask the client if that man had been saying hes the manager. He confirmed that he had been under the assumption that he was since the start of the job and he had also been discussing details of the job with him as well. 
So as you can expect I go and talk to my fathers friend and ask him if hes been pretending to be in charge. 
And he didn't even denay it and started trying to claim that he knows how to run a company better anyway. 
So I fired him on the spot infrount of all the other staff and the client. And now I'm getting the 3rd degree from both parents.

Our flat has two bedrooms - we use one and the other is a spare for quests and also an office. I was under the impression that my boyfriend is out, however I haven’t met hus family yet (we are in California, his family is in Florida). He assured me that he is out of the closet. 

He told me his parents are coming to visit us. Cool. No problem with me - my own parents have spent the night at our flat in the past. When I came back home from work, my boyfriend was tidying up the spare bedroom/office. Or so I thought. When I peeked in I noticed he moved some of my personal stuff that I keep in our bedroom to the spare bedroom. My entire nightstand for example, with my chargers and books. I asked him what’s up with that, do his parents need my chargers or something? He looked embarrassed and told me that I “have to” sleep in this bedroom. 

Turns out his parents have no idea he is gay. They know about me but they think we are roommates. He wants me to play along and pretend that I live in the spare bedroom. His parents will sleep in our bed while he will take the couch.

I said no freaking way and he got mad, saying that I have no right to force him to come out. Well god damn I though he has been out for ages! Now after a year of living together he springs on me that his parents think he is straight. I don’t even know if they know that I, the supposed roommate, am gay. Is he gonna ask some female friend to act as his beard too? 

We fought about this, I won’t budge. I moved in with him thinking he’s an openly gay man, I simply will not play this game. His parents are coming over tomorrow and I told him that either he tells them the truth and I stay in the flat as his partner of 2+ years, or he can greet them as a single “straight” dude with no roommates because I’m packing my shit and going to crash at a friend’s place. 

He calls me the asshole for forcing him to come out, I call him the asshole for disregarding me and my feelings. He tells me that I can’t understand since I come from a “cool hippie San Francisco family” and his folks are “southern religious hicks” and being gay is not cool with them. Fair enough but he told me repeatedly in the past that he is out! I’ve been lied to.

Applicants are graded from 472 to 528 based on a percentile. A 478 is literally the bottom 2% of test takers. The median/average score that can maybe get you into a med school is a 500. You must score at least a 508 to be in the top 20% of applicants, in a field where only about 20% of applicants each year accepted into all the med schools in the country.

Results for the June 15 exam came out yesterday. This coworker was happily telling people how she passed and got a 478. I myself aspire to be a doctor but postponed taking the MCAT because I have been unable to hit a 505 consistently in full length practice tests. I have an trying to coach her, telling her that she must hit at least a 500 to be even considered as a serious applicant. Throughout this process, I have noticed that she didn’t have a solid prep plan, or a good idea of how to be a pre-med student (she is non traditional like me).

So when she was happily telling our other coworkers (and the doctors we work for!) that she got a 478, I took her aside and tried to explain to her the reality of the situation as nicely as possible. Threw in some encouraging words about the virtues of retaking, implored her to hit the Kaplan books and really research the kinds of students the schools she wants to apply to (she just wants to get in anywhere).  I asked her to reconsider postponing her applications until next year. She had already sent out some primaries but haven’t gotten any secondary applications back.

We ended the engagement shortly after the new year because he cheated on me. The wedding was initially planned with just my money but was very low key, and my parents asked if they could put up some additional money to make the whole thing a bit bigger. By the end about 60% of the wedding was paid for by me and 40% my parent's contribution. My ex and I had agreed that I would pay for the wedding while he covered the honeymoon.

My ex left me to deal with cancelling the wedding as his money wasn't involved, and I turned to my mother and sister for help because I didn't have the mental or emotional capacity to call vendors and venues and whatever else and cancel everything.

My sister is engaged, and helped me with a lot of wedding planning. Next thing I know, my mother and sister are asking me if I wouldn't mind my sister just.... taking my wedding. Every part of it, from the venue to the cake, and everything in between. The sole difference will be the wedding dress, and even then she's said if she can't buy off the rack she might have to get mine tailored to fit her instead.

I called off my engagement less than 3 weeks ago. I am a fucking mess. I reached out to my family to help me cancel the wedding, and my sister is planning to take it over instead.

My sister has rung round our family explaining that she's taking over before she told me this. They are all attending. Her fiance has contacted his family and given them the date he will be getting married. I found all this out TODAY. She asked me if I was okay with this, like she hadn't already arranged everything. I told her to go fuck herself.

I have until the 23rd to cancel things and get the money back. There's a couple of things where I won't get money back at this stage but over 2/3 of it is still refundable. The money will be refunded to the card it was paid by, so both me and my parents will get the correct amounts back. Everything is shut right now but it's the 21st tomorrow. As I've not been in contact with these companies and it's my name on all the contracts, I have full power over this wedding. My sister said she'd pay me back eventually but knowing her I'll never see that money again.

WIBTA if I rung round everything and cancelled?

&#x200B;

Update: I talked to my sister and explained how upset I was and how hurt this made me feel and she said that this was a good thing, and it would be therapeutic for me to see good come from bad. I said that is really not what it's feeling like on my end, and to me it feels like I got cheated on a month before my wedding and my sister said she would cancel everything for me and then decided that getting married in my dress in the venue my ex and I picked out together on my anniversary date, and this did not feel good.

I said if she wanted to buy the wedding off me then I needed payment in full for my 60% by the 23rd, and I wanted to switch out our names on the contracts. She said she was hoping for closer to a payment plan, where she paid me back 50% of the 60% I put down in monthly installments over the next TEN MONTHS. She wanted to pay me back 5% PER MONTH for 10 MONTHS. AND I STILL WOULDN'T GET ALL MY MONEY BACK.

I've made calls and cancelled everything. Everything was paid for by me and my parent's money paid primarily for upgrades to the things I'd already bought. The money will be refunded to whoever paid for it, so myself and my parents will all get the correct money back, however, with some, like the caterer, we've lost the deposit entirely, with some, like the venue, they kept part of the money (average 50% but some kept more and some kept less) and with some, like the baker who was a family friend and hadn't started on the cake yet, they completely refunded it. I think the fact that I was open that the wedding was off because he cheated made them feel bad for me and probably made a few of them more lenient on refunds (didn't just bring it up for the sake of it, most of them asked if I'd wanted to reschedule). On the whole, I've gotten a little over half back, which is not as much as I thought. Really annoying thing is that I put these cancellations through on the 21st, and if I'd done it on the 18th (2 full weeks notice) I'd have gotten more, but they waited until the 20th to tell me.

The dates are now open, the plans are now there, if she wants to rebook everything in her name she is welcome to. She helped me with a fuckton of planning, knows the details better than I do, and she can easily rebook the exact same thing and will probably be doing the vendors a favour considering how close we are to the big day.

Some refunds will be instant, some will take a bit of time (longest is 2 weeks), and I'm no longer going on my honeymoon so once all the refunds have come through I might book a week away somewhere. Not sure what's happening with my sister/mother/family at large.

In total, I would have gotten more back from my sister than I would from the venues, but it would be a year wait on her repaying me vs a few weeks on the venues.

Due to that, all of my income (and for most of the servers in the state) is comprised of tips.

Recently, I got into an argument with an acquaintance (25M) of mine. He’d mentioned how he doesn’t believe in tipping, and that it wasn’t right of me to treat customers that never tip as less important than other customers. Generally, if I have a lot of tables, I will put off serving cheapskates until my other tables are caught up.

I understand that the tipping system is broken, but I also believe people that don’t tip with the mindset of “I’m gonna change this system,” are either consciously or subconsciously taking advantage of it. 

And I believe a portion of people refusing to tip is not gonna change the system and force my employers to give me a living wage, but instead, just screw me over because I live in a small-town and don’t have the option of finding a different job.

AITA here? I know my opinion is entirely biased. What do you think?

I have actually known my husband for about 8 years, as we work together. I always found him to be a handsome guy, but never did I start falling for him until a year after his first wife passed. He even introduced me to their kids before we officially started dating. They all accepted me with open arms and have all been nothing short of amazing. 

We got married last November and welcomed our daughter in September. About a month back, we had some family photos done with all 7 of us. They finally arrived in the mail recently and I decided to start framing & hanging them throughout the house. There are 4 photos with my husbands late wife hanging around the house. 3 of them are old family photos and the other is a shot of just her. 

There are only so many places to hang photos in this house, so I decided to move one of the old ‘family’ photos and place our newly done photo there. The old frame was a lot smaller than the new one I had put it, so I moved the old one to a more tight spot in a less visible area of the house.

I soon came to the realization that this may have come off a bit tacky, so I talked to my husband and children about it upon their arrival from work/school. They all said it was no big deal and encouraged me to leave the newly framed photo in this spot, which I did.

Over the weekend, ‘her’ parents came over to visit with the kids. They, especially her mother, have always seemed to have a blatant disdain for me. She discouraged my husband from marrying me because I was ‘too young’ to help raise 4 children . Then, she yelled at me for referring to myself as the kids mother. Despite the tense past, I have never seen her as angry as she was about the changing of pictures. 

She accused me of trying to replace her daughter by giving rid of all evidence that she once lived in the house. I assured her that was not the case. She demanded that I put the original picture back in its place and find another spot to put my photo. I refused, telling her that my husband and her grandchildren had all approved of the way I did things. She then when on a long rant about how I have no respect for her or her husband. I replied by saying that this is my house and I will do things the way I want just as she can arrange the things she wants in her own house. They angrily stormed out of the house and we haven’t heard from them since. 

Perhaps I came off a little too hard, but this woman has been making my life miserable from day one. I had simply had enough and felt that I had to put my foot down and stop letting her get away with the ‘grieving’ excuse.",False,1575687353.0,2019-12-07 02:33:11
"AITA for staying in touch with, and giving money to, the daughter my mom gave up for adoption?",13980,Not the A-hole,1038,fy4rcc,1586509281.0,"So, my mom got pregnant when she was 20 and gave the baby up for adoption. Years later she met my dad, got married and had me. 

The daughter she gave up, I’ll call her Sarah, is now 35. About 6 months ago Sarah reached out to my mom and they got to meet and talk for the first time. After that, Sarah was invited a couple times over for dinner to meet us; I liked her, but I think by the third dinner my mom had definitely changed her opinion of Sarah, and it showed. 

I will add my mom lacks certain maternal instincts; she will always care deeply about status and appearance, more than anyone I’ve met, which we’ve always butted heads over. 

Sarah is a waitress, a chain smoker, dresses a bit sloppy, and just generally wouldn’t fit in with my mother’s standards or her world. She also had a previous drug arrest when younger, for cocaine, which she told us about on the third dinner.

After that dinner, my mom said we should probably stop meeting with her and literally called her a “disappointment.” My dad was also surprised but just leaves the decision up to her. I didn’t say much but before this, Sarah and I had already followed each other on Instagram and exchanged numbers. We texted maybe once every couple weeks, just talking about random stuff. I think she got the hint my mom didn’t want her around anymore but we really didn’t address it. I feel bad for her, I can only imagine it would be hard to finally connect with your biological mom and be let down like that. 

Anyways, with everything happening recently, she lost her job. I saw her post about this and wanted to help, so I sent her $400. I have a decent job and have a good amount saved, so I felt like I could afford to, and she is my biological sister after all. Maybe part of it was guilt over how shitty my mom was. 

My mom found out about this and got very upset. She said I had no right to keep in contact with Sarah let alone be sending her money, that really it wasn’t my business to do this, and that it was very disrespectful to her. 

I didn’t think she’d be this upset over it and I have no experience with this kind of situation. I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong but I’m curious what others think. 

TLDR: my mom gave up a baby girl, Sarah, before she had me. They reconnected and as my mom is obsessed with status and appearance, she was “disappointed” with Sarah (a chainsmoking waitress with a previous drug arrest). My mom didn’t want us to see her anymore. I kept in touch with Sarah and even sent her $400 recently when she lost her job. Mom is extremely upset by this.",False,False,2020-04-10 02:01:21
UPDATE: WIBTA if I went to a funeral I'm not invited to,13986,UPDATE,203,euitxc,1580128330.0,"Original: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d62jcw/wibta_if_i_went_to_a_funeral_im_not_invited_to/

Recap: I was disowned by my family a few years back. I found out through text my dad had died and was told I wasn't wanted at the funeral.

First I want to say thanks, because even though this isn't an advice sub I received good advice on my original post and it really helped me reach out to my Dad's side of the family.

I did end up going to my dad's service and funeral, my aunt took me along with my grandparents. Thanks to all the ex-mormons who told me what I should expect at the funeral, if I hadn't known what was going to happen I would've probably been even more of a mess than I already was. My mom and her family were not happy to see me, she didn't even talk to me during the funeral which I guess is a lot better than her yelling at me. My older brother sat with me and my dad's side of the family during the funeral and was my support through the whole thing. He and my grandparents even encouraged me to get up and share stories about my dad when the time came for people to give final words.

The wake was nice, I guess my dad would sneak out and get a drink with my uncle every now and then so they had the wake at their favorite bar. My brother supporting me through everything and realizing he would have my back even when it came to our mom means the world to me.

I'm still trying to process his death, especially since he died on his way to see me. I've started seeing a therapist at my brother and aunt's suggestion, I was in a really bad place for a few weeks after the funeral, and it's really been a lot of help. Yesterday was my dad's birthday and my aunt and I drove up to visit his grave. It was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be, but hard nonetheless.

AITA for not letting my family see my baby?,13961,Not the A-hole,1476,f73bsk,1582276411.0,"I (Caucasian F26) married (Filipino M 28) 2018. Everyone in my family is married to someone Caucasian,  literally no-one is in a mixed relationship. About 2 years ago I met my husband and we've been in love ever since. My parents never approved of our relationship and gave me an ultimatum. If I didn't leave him they'd kick me out and never speak to me again.  There was not one reason to hate him bc 1. They've never met him 2. They didn't want to meet him at all and 3. As soon as I mentioned he was Asian they looked visibly upset and my dad turned beet red. And since I didn't leave him, everyone in my family shunned me. For over two years my family didn't talk to me and didn't even know if I was okay. I tried to call them and even visit, but they'd never answer. After a while I got tired of trying. 

Fast forward 2018, my husband proposed and we agreed on having a small wedding with just close friends and family (80 people approx). I invited my parents, siblings, and close family but no-one showed up. I was so heartbroken because I never got my parents blessing and this is a one in a lifetime event. Towards the end of 2018 I find out I'm pregnant with our first child and we're so excited to be parents. I plan out a small baby shower and I again invite my family and no-one shows up. My mom decides to phone me later that night to tell me that my child will never be accepted into their family and that I'm a disgrace.  At this point I'm fed up with them because they have so much hatred to their own grandson and he's just an innocent baby. A few weeks later I give birth and no-one in my family shows up to see him. But I didn't let them affect my happiness. 

Fast forward to this year 2020, my son is 6 months old and he doesn't know who his aunts, uncles, cousins, or grandparents are. He doesn't know any family besides my husband's. Two nights ago, my mom called to meet her grandkid but I immediately said no and didn't explain why. I'm afraid they might hurt my child to begin with and they never cared for him until now.

WIBTA for calling off the wedding,13944,Not the A-hole,1533,g0lxfy,1586822967.0,"Alright, so I'm pretty torn here.

I've been dating a girl for a long time and it's been mostly great. I proposed a few months ago and we've been planning some wedding stuff recently.

Well, she has also recently dropped it on me that it is ""family tradition"" to put a ball and chain on the groom at the reception as ""joke"" and they won't take it off until whenever the fuck they decide to.

I am certainly not doing that, but she seems pretty firm on it. I feel like if you want to embarrass me like that, you can host your own reception without my family and friends there, and embarrass me all you want in front of your family and friends.

Really might call this off if they're expecting me to go ball and chain, and I don't feel like I'm being unreasonable but she's pretty fucking mad at me right now for my refusal

________________

Edit - Super overwhelmed with the responses, I didn't expect this many people to show up and agree with me. I really appreciate everyone's thoughts and advice, but there is no way I'll be able to reply to everyone so here's some more info based on what I've read (most of the comments thus far). 

1. No, I am not just looking for a reason to call off the wedding

2. Yes, you guys bring up very good points that if something like this would cause me to throw it away then it may be some form of writing on the walls (just to confirm, I do not want to throw it away).

3. I will not be caving in to this in any way shape or form unless as I mentioned earlier, she wants to finance her own private reception where her family and friends can embarrass me all they want while mine aren't present. 

4. The point above, imo, doesn't mean the wedding will be called off. It's up to how firm she is on the ""joke"" and if they'll just let it go.",False,1586805380.0,2020-04-13 17:09:27
AITA? I kicked my girlfriend out to give my brother somewhere to stay.,13942,Not the A-hole,1888,fbaqn2,1583001006.0,"Okay so bear with me I do not do Reddit, a friend just suggested I post this here for an outside perspective. I've read the rules and the formatting stuff but I'm also a giant fucking moron so I can make no promises I'll do this right lmao. For context, I'm a 25 year old guy, my girlfriend is a 28 year old woman, my brother is a 16 year old guy. 

Basically, my parents are dicks. They've always been more concerned with what the neighbours might think above all else and their relationships to my siblings and I definitely suffered for it. We weren't mistreated per se, but there was definitely tension if we didn't fit their standards exactly. My little brother, who is the youngest,  suffers particularly badly with these. He's kind of goth/punk and our parents don't really approve of his fashion choices, which they fight about a lot. He's also gay, which is a weird point of contention. Our parents are very much ""we have no problem with gays, we just think they should keep it behind closed doors"" kind of homophobes, and they basically refuse to acknowledge or accept that my brother is gay. However, he recently got a boyfriend, which obviously makes that harder for them to do and it's been causing a lot more fights in the house. 

Anyway, last night my brother calls me absolutely crying his eyes out. I guess he and dad got into it because a nosy neighbour saw my brother kissing his boyfriend when his bf dropped him off at home and made a shitty comment to our parents. Fight culminated in Dad basically telling him to get out of the house. He asks if he can come stay at mine, and I say of course he can, I'll make up the guest room for him rn. This is where the problem happens; my girlfriend was also spending the night last night. She's mostly great, but she hates children to the point where she refuses to spend an extended period of time with anyone under the age of 20 if it can be avoided. My brother is included in this. She immediately began complaining that I didn't consult her first, and asked if my brother couldn't stay at his boyfriend's place instead, or just apologise to dad and go home. I said no, he's asked to stay here, he's upset and he's my baby brother, so he's coming to stay here. Girlfriend took the huff and basically said if he comes over to stay she's going home. I said 'alright see you then'. She just looked at me all shocked, then stormed out without saying anything. She later sent me a flurry of texts telling me what an inconsiderate, selfish, bad boyfriend I am (as did her flatmate), and is now refusing to speak to me. 

Did I do the wrong thing?

Edit: everyone is being so kind to me wtf you guys are lovely. Also my brother informs me this made it to Twitter, so hello lovely Twitter people too lol. 

These comments have given me a lot to think about. Tbh, my girlfriend has been a little bit childish from the get go, but it was never to the point of being an issue. She's the only child of parents who are absolutely ""fuck you"" rich and is a self described ""princess"" who is very used to getting her own way. We've been together five months so far and she's super clever and a really, really good laugh most of the time, plus she's one of the only people I know who is into weird foreign horror films like I am (I know, I know, middle class English white boy into foreign films, don't worry, I am aware that I'm the worst) so I've always kind of put up with her being a bit of brat cause she's fun. However, this whole event (with the help of some of the comments here) has helped me to put a lot of the things she's done and said thus far into perspective. I've come to the recollection that despite being funny and clever and as much of a pretentious hipster shit as I am, she's just not really a very nice person. 

I'm going to give her some time to cool off and then try to talk to her. I'm going to explain that my brother is my best friend, he's important to me and she can't expect that to change just because she has some vendetta against kids. I'm also going to try to discuss her general attitude with her, see if there's any kind of underlying problem and what I can do to help if there is. I'm very cognizant of the fact that it's likely to end in a breakup but honestly, at this point, if she isn't willing to change then I don't think I'm missing much.

WIBTA if I didn't share my inheritance with my brother?,13921,Not the A-hole,1323,f3wwy7,1581735740.0,"Me (26f) and my brother (27m) grew up close. As kids do, we eventually grew apart into our teens. My brother wound up dropping out of HS and falling in with a bad crowd. I got a full ride to college. I don't begrudge my brother not going to college. College isn't for everyone, and sometimes education in general is not compatible. It's fine. I loved him dearly, still do.

It's just that he's 27 and hasn't ever had a job. Any job. Literally any job. He lives in an apartment paid for by our parents in a very expensive part of the city and does nothing but smoke pot and play video games all day. He knows my mom is too afraid of him being homeless to stop supporting him, and my dad just goes along with it. They've refinanced their house several times to support him, which meant they never supported me financially.

Recently, my grandpa died. I was really close to him and the news hit me hard. I would go over once a week at least to clean his house for him (he was 95) go grocery shopping, run errands, hang out, etc. My brother was not welcome in my grandpa's house because he had in the past stolen things. Multiple times he stole valuables from Italy, where my grandpa was born, he stole a TV once, he stole my deceased grandma's jewelry--all to pay for weed.

I was informed by the executor of my grandpa's estate that I inherited one of his houses and a decent amount of money from him. My brother inherited money as well, but far less. Think 100k vs 10k. I feel awful. Yeah my brother can be a shithead but I do love him. I'm sure he has some undiagnosed mental issues. Recently my mom came down HARD, hinting and then flat out informing me that I was to share the ""ridiculous amount of money"" with my brother so that he can get on his feet and my mom could have a break supporting him.

Thing is, I don't want to share. I know it's a lot of money and a house, but I don't want to enable my brother to continue his lifestyle. I don't feel like it's my job to worry about what my parents do, because it's their choice, but I don't want to help. My mom is mad, my brother is mad, my dad is mad--so now I wonder if I am an AH for not giving him a little bit more.

So? WIBTA?

ETA: WOW, I didn't expect anything near this kind of feedback. There are so many comments and pieces of good advice and I can't reply to them all but please know I've read and taken to heart every single word, and all of you have strengthened my resolve that I am allowed to say no. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, even the few people who said I was too harsh. I appreciate your insight, every single one of you.

I wanted to clarify something, because a few people wondered what my parents got. It was my mom's dad and they didn't get along very well, but about ten years ago my grandpa gave them their inheritance early. I don't know all of the exact details because I was a teenager and worried about other things lol, but I do know my parents and grandparents (my grandma was alive then) sat down with a lawyer and it was very serious and suddenly my parents had enough money to buy new cars that they needed. I think they also threw money at my high school to make them stop complaining about my brother, but that's just a theory. So yes, they were acknowledged in the will as having asked for and accepted their inheritance early.",False,1581728401.0,2020-02-14 19:02:20
AITA For telling my husband that if he had to choose between my self and my daughter during birth to choose me?,13921,Not the A-hole,2935,e80r4y,1575873631.0,"So my daughter was born 2 years ago, I had a very good pregnancy but develop gestational diabetes at 32 weeks (due to me being overweight I was checking my sugar levels every other day). Due to this my OBGYN schedule a cesarean I didn’t have any issues with this I just wanted my baby to be born safely.
So before going in to the hospital I talked with my husband that if something where to happened and he needed to choose between myself and our baby to please choose me. He got quiet but said that he agreed and that please let me mother know about what we talked.

Everything went according to plan and both of us where completely fine.

Now fast forward to now trying for number two and in a Christmas party with my girlfriends the topic was brought up about babys. There’s another friend that is also trying so the topic of conversation was on that for a good hour.

When my friend ask me that if I was ready for another 9 months of pregnancy and how I felt. I answer truthfully cause honestly I was just letting all the fears and doubts go.

I said that I do want another baby and that pregnancy doesn’t scare me such as giving birth again. I said that I straight told my husband again that I’m scared that something may happened to me during the birth and in the hopes of giving my daughter a sibling I could leave her without a mother. That the original agreement stands that he needs to choose me if that’s the case.

My friends where disgusted with my thinking and said that i was an asshole to my husband in asking him to basically kill his baby (those where the exact words), that I was a very negative person and that I needed to rethink my thoughts. I’m a person that likes to be prepared for the worse case scenario and hope for the best. I didn’t want my husband to be blindsided with who to choose and to have the answer on the spot. Nobody likes to think in what could go wrong specially in a pregnancy but I need to think every possible case that we could encounter. 

So Reddit AITA!?

Edit: so this blew up, just to clarify some points

1-English is not my first language 

2-I say Christmas party but this was at a friends house every year we ( work friends, 8 people) meet to celebrate the end of the year we talk about everything. I have yet to talk to them since this happened I didn’t want to create a scene. It did affect me that they think I’m such a negative person but I will talk with them.

3- yes I’m overweight and I had an almost perfect pregnancy.  People telling me to loose some weight before having another baby, thank you! I didn’t though of that before how enlightening! Also why do people want to know how much I weight? If you don’t know GD can affect any woman that is not overweight yes you have a better chance to have it but not only overweight woman develop it.

4- yes I know this scenario is not a likely one anymore due to the advances in medicine, but giving birth is a serious things, so many things can go wrong in an instant an I wanted to be prepared for it.

5- my thinking was, if something happened to us (me and baby) and my husband had to choose, either way his decision will be judge by my family. 
What if I died and he had to tell my parents sorry but I choose  the baby. 
That’s why he asked me to tell my mom of what we had agree to.
When the conversation was brought up my husband said he thought the same thing, he asked himself what would he do in that case and said that he was feeling awful cause he knew he wanted to save me but didn’t know how to tell me.  
So my husband wasn’t force or I made the decision for him. Also we did talked about if I end up in a ventilator or coma or anything like that I left instructions.

6- this is not a pro-life click bait or anything related to that.

7- people don’t like to think about the bad stuff during pregnancy but the risks for the mother are massive, your body goes under so much. It also takes a mental toll on you. 

8- also people that are saying that if I’m not prepared to die for my baby I shouldn’t be a mother are TA. 


9- just some facts for you  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 700 women die in childbirth every year, and over 50,000 more nearly die, experiencing “severe maternal morbidity,” most often due to complications from severe bleeding.

AITA for telling my daughter to shut up and that not everything is about her?,13911,Not the A-hole,808,gqkv3k,1590474857.0,"We have 4 kids. Our son who is 34 and married, our daughter 32 who is single and our fraternal twins (m and f 25). Our son is in a long term relationship and our daughter is engaged to be married. 

Right now we are all planning the wedding of our younger daughter Anna. Our other daughter Sarah has been...... Not supportive to say the least.
We tried to cut her some slack at the beginning because Sara's long term partner of 4 years had cheated on her a year prior. They had talked about marriage so she always thought that she would get married before Anna.

So when Anna announced her engagement 2 months ish after Sara had split with her partner and Sara went crying to the bathroom, I asked Anna for some sympathy. Even if that had dampened the mood Anna didn't seem to mind much.

But this has been a trend since then. Everytime we bring something up that has to do with the wedding Sara starts pouting and we end up Consoling her and talking about her. I wanted to stop enabling her and suggested she get some counseling. Because while it was very hurtful it could not stop her from living her life. She blew up at me and accused me of favoritism. I was very stunned because, while we have done many things wrong, we have never favored one child over the other. We gave them different kinds of support but the same kind of love (e.g our oldest was always the weakest in math so he got a tutor in school while our youngest son didn't get a tutor but he got classes in guitar because he was keen on that).

So here I might be the asshole. After that fight following happened. Where we are everything is opening up again. So the bridal store where we had an appointment called us and reassigned it to last Thursday, with restrictions. We could be 2 people besides the bride and we had to minimize the dress choices to 3. Well of course Anna asked Sara if she wanted to come with us and Sara just started berating Anna that she had been a bad sister for these last few months, that she should be ashamed, that she was selfish etc. I tried defusing the situation, reminding her that it was not fair what she was saying. That she was speaking from a place of hurt but that she should not lash out on her sister. Sara kept going screaming, crying etc. Anna started crying and even our sons came to look what was going on. It got so much that I slammed my hand on the table and said very loudly (not screaming)to shut up, that not everything in this life was about her and that we had been as patient as we could offering an open ear and everything that was in our hands to ease her pain but that we would not stop living our life's because of that. Sara called me a bitch and stormed out.

I feel awful . AITA?


Edit : I thought this might be important. We don't talk all the time about the wedding. It has been a more frequent topic in these last 2 moths especially but before that it was very sporadically.

Edit : wow this got kind of big. I went to bed after just a few replies. I am reading every single one.


As for one question that keeps coming up. The things with my sons is comparable because my oldest really stressed himself out with math. Would study hours with no result. So getting him a good tutor was life changing. My younger son has always been an over achiever in school. He didn't really have a subject that he was weak in. But he constantly overworked himself and stressed himself out. Which is why the guitar lessons come in, they were an outlet for his stress",False,1590476070.0,2020-05-25 23:34:17

For some context, I had a university deadline last Friday, and another university application deadline this Friday.

When I moved out a few years ago my parents insisted on keeping all my college and university so they could keep it safe, I thought fair enough, they have a much bigger house and the space available to keep everything in one place and safe. Since then, extensive clearing out has occurred at my parents house.

Fast forward to last month and I let my mum know that I would be needing my sketchbooks from my uni work in order to apply onto master programmes. I keep mentioning it and she keeps saying she'll get dad to look in the attic for them. This Sunday comes round, i go over to pick them up and no one has looked for them yet. 


Last night they let me know that they can't find anything. They've found my brothers stuff and a lot of scrappy stuff but nothing that resembles three years of university work...


Long story short, my parents have basically lost my uni work, my application to these other universities is now compromised, mum is saying i need to sort this out myself now as she thinks I've given them a hard time

Am I the asshole?


Edit 1: Thankyou to everyone who had commented, I will include a bit more info below as I've seen a few re-occuring comments.

When at home I had searched the house with no luck, my parents said they had put everything in the attic for safe keeping - the attic doesn't have a drop down ladder and unless you're over 6ft like my dad, it's impossible to get inside. My work was apparently somewhere i could not physically get to. 

3. Im an architecture student, and whilst i do have digital presentation sheets, the emphasis of the interview is sketchbooks, hand drawn sheets and models - which i found trashed in the attic (the models).

AITA for not forgiving my little sister for outing me six years ago?,13885,Not the A-hole,2179,eqtevd,1579448267.0,"I (22M) was raised in a highly religious household. I knew I was gay when I was twelve, and it was the most terrifying realization of my life. I knew, with absolute certainty, that every single person of importance in my life would hate me if they found out. 

When I was 16, I entered an online relationship with a boy I met through Tumblr. We never met in real life, but he was one of the first people I spoke to honestly about my sexuality. One day, my little sister (then 13F, now 19F) asked me if she could borrow my computer (I got my computer when I started high school, so she didn't have one of her own yet). I was usually very anal about clearing my internet history, but I didn't think my sister was gonna do much other than poke around Youtube, so I just let her have it. Unfortunately, my email was open, and she noticed that I'd received a notification about a message my bf had sent me on Tumblr. She read it.

She immediately told me that she had to tell mom and dad ""that their son was a sinner."" I begged and begged and begged her not to – literally on my knees, crying – but she insisted that mom and dad deserved to know, so she went downstairs and told them. Long story short, I spent the next year in a conversion therapy program before finally having a huge blowout with my father and getting kicked out of the house. I haven't spoken to my parents since. I spent almost a year homeless (though I am, luckily, doing much better now).

Three months ago, I got a Facebook message from my little sister. She told me that she's thought a lot about what she did all those years ago, and that she hopes for us to reconnect. At first, I had a lot of difficulty responding to her message, but after some encouragement from a few friends of mine, I finally got back to her. I asked her what she was up to, and what she meant by ""thinking about"" what she'd done.

She responded by saying that she'd just started her sophomore year of college, and that she was doing really well, but that going to college had given her a new perspective on LGBT issues, which was why she'd finally questioned whether she was right to tell our parents about me. She said she was sorry, and that she hoped I could forgive her.

I don't think I can, though? For one thing, like... she's just now realizing she was wrong? After she literally watched me get abused for a year then kicked out? Plus, I just can't reconcile the fact that she's still close with our parents, who are sending her to a great school and giving her such a wonderful life. It's just not fair.

I told her I don't think we can have a relationship. She responded that she ""hopes I change my mind.""

My friends say that I'm being petty, that she was just a child when she outed me, that I should give her the opportunity to make amends, and that I'm taking out my anger at our parents on her. But I think I have a right to set the boundaries that I need.

Aita for leaving my husband to take care of our newborn alone,13837,Not the A-hole,886,fjvpl3,1584433797.0,"I gave birth to mine and my husbands first child one week ago. My husband and my MIL have since then been acting like I’m extremely fragile and should be on bed rest. I really don’t feel as fragile as they think I am, I can do mostly everything I used to do before getting pregnant, just now with some mild discomfort and pain downstairs (I’ve gotten through the worst of it by now). 

Due to having a newborn, and with everything going on at the moment, my husband and MIL have been lecturing me if I try to do anything other than stay in bed with our newborn. If we need anything from the store  or have to take care of anything that requires for us to go outside, my husband will be the one to run out and take care of it. I’ve only been out less than a handful of times since giving birth and these were just for occasions that I absolutely had to be there for.

Today my husband and I decided we were tired of eating unfrozen chicken broth, and neither of us had the energy to cook, so he went out to get us some takeout. He came back about an hour later with no food(it shouldve taken him 15 minutes max, as the place he was going to was fast food and like a 3 minute drive from our house). Mind you, he left his phone at home because it was uncharged, so this entire time I had no way to contact him and ask where he was at.

When he came back, he told me he had been downstairs at my MIL’s apartment the whole time (she’s our neighbor) mounting her TV and getting a few things done for her. He asked if I still wanted takeout. I was obviously annoyed that he couldn’t at least come back upstairs and let me know he’d be taking care of his moms apartment first, and had me waiting for him thinking I’d get some food by the end of it. 

I told him no, I’d go get my own food now and that I’m tired of sitting at home just because he and his mom say I should. As I was leaving he asked if I didn’t feel bad leaving our newborn. I told him that he obviously didn’t so why should I. 

The thing is, I do feel guilty and I don’t know why. I feel like we should both be with our baby right now, even if he thinks remodeling his moms apartment is more important. AITA?",False,False,2020-03-17 01:29:57
WIBTA if I stopped inviting my triggered friend to movie night?,13817,Asshole,2335,cf1lbg,1563530547.0,"Tdlr at the bottom

Every couple of weeks me (f24) and my friends get together for a “classic movie night” at my house. We drink, joke around, and watch old movies deemed to be “important to film”. Good times.

The problem: one friend (23f) has been through an awful trauma recently which has affected her profoundly. Our group has really huddled around her to make sure she is okay and lend our support any way we can... but... in the last few times we got together she got triggered by the graphic scenes in the films we were watching and politely asks that we stop. (The first time was Rosemary’s Baby and the second was Taxi Driver, if that matters.)

Of course we all wanted to be sensitive so both times we immedietly turned it off and the group quickly dispersed after (kind of a bummer). Independantly, friends from the group have asked that I not invite her the next time, because we want to watch Clockwork Orange which will definetly be triggering to her. Since I’m hosting, it is up to me, but since I usually invite everyone via a group chat that she is in, it would require some maneuvering to exclude her.

God I feel like such a dick but my friends and I really want to be free to watch what we want without worrying about making her uncomfortable. WIBTA if I went out of my way to NOT invite her?

Tldr: My friends and I want to watch movies that our traumatized friend may find triggering - WIBTA to just not invite her anymore?

EDIT: Wow. So it took just 45min for me to realize Im an asshole! Some smart commenter posted an obvious solution: i will be using https://www.unconsentingmedia.org/ from now on to vet our films before movie night.

AITA... I’m pissed that I got a Peloton for my birthday,13809,Not the A-hole,2104,f03owy,1581071179.0,"Throwaway account 

So, I realize I already sound like a brat. This is the most expensive present I have ever received in my life and I enjoy spin classes, but the back story is what is important here. 

About a month ago, my significant other said he had spoken with my sister and came up with some ideas for my birthday and would I like to hear them. I obviously said yes and the first thing on the list was a peloton. I have never had any interest in a peloton and as you can see by the spelling in my throwaway username, I can’t even spell it right let alone know anything about it. 

I said no thanks it’s way too expensive and I have no interest in it. I work out at work where I spin 2-4 times a week and watch YouTube spin videos. I have an hour lunch break and go to the gym then to make sure I actually get my workouts done. 

After providing that explanation, I followed up multiple times in the weeks saying “Please, do not buy me a Peloton,” “If you ordered a Peloton, please cancel the order and return it.” 

Today (the day before my birthday) I walk down into the basement, and there’s the damn Peloton. I’m immediately pissed off. Ask why when I said countless times I didn’t want one, there one is in my basement. My fiancé just stared at me blankly. He thought I would change my mind when I saw it. I maintain that I’ve told him ten+ times that I don’t want one and why would he expect me to change my mind. 

We aren’t currently speaking because he’s pissed I’m not happy with the gift. So Reddit, AITA?

UPDATE: Wow guys! I can’t believe how this has blown up. I went to bed when there were like 20-40 replies and now I haven’t even gotten a chance to read 90% of replies. I appreciate all the responses. Thank god I used a throwaway and so far no one I know has seen this or at least had the balls to call me out yet.  It took a while, but I finally got my fiancé to understand my side of things. He wanted to do something big as my first birthday engaged. He knows I’m frugal and would never ever get this for myself. I believe him when he says he genuinely thought it was a money thing when I said no. He is super apologetic and gets it. We are going to my birthday dinner soon, so all is well. As for the Peloton, it will be returned. I may try it for fun since we have 30 days to send it back. Not sure what I’ll get instead, but at least some puppy training for our dog.

It was nothing but posts about her talking shit about me, our cousin, and a couple of her other friends.  I went to confront my sister about this and basically told her if she has a problem with me she can say it to my face.  When I showed her the screenshot she said she can saw whatever she wants about me or anyone.  I told her to take down the posts or the account, and my sister told me that she won't do any of that. 

My friend recently sent me another screenshot and it was her full on her going over the full conversation we had and her talking shit about me again.  I knew I wasn't gonna do shit so I straight up told my mom that she was making fun of me on an instagram account, my mom nearly tore her head off and she had to delete the account in front of her lol.

AITA for refusing to return a lost dog that was clearly well loved?,13730,Asshole,2583,gih4et,1589336772.0,"About 7 months ago a friend found a dog near her house. I took her in and called animal control. They said to bring her in to look for a microchip. She was underweight with dirty fur. AC couldn't find a microchip so they said I could hold onto her for a week and they would list her on their website and if nobody claimed her I could adopt her. So that's exactly what happened.

My dog now has shiny fur and is very healthy. She is polite and walks well on a leash. She does lots of tricks. I have depression and anxiety and she's my support animal. She's honestly the light of my life.

Last month I joined a Facebook group for the same unusual purebreed that my dog is. I posted a picture of her in the group. A woman was tagged and a few hours later she DMs me. She said my dog was her dog and she was so thankful I found her and wanted to arrange to come get her. She offered to pay me for taking good care of her.

I thought she was trying to scam me since she lived across the country but when I looked into it I found her IG with alot of dog pictures and videos. My dog has very unique markings so it was unmistakeably the same dog as the one in her pictures. My dog is a show champion and had a lot of training to do obedience, agility and a few others I've never heard of. She has alot of fancy titles too. My dog was clearly well cared for, well trained, and well loved.

She said her house caught fire last year and she lost everything, including my dog who ran away. Nobody knows how she traveled so far or what happened between when she got lost and when my friend found her. She never stopped looking for my dog. She even had a video of my dog as a super cute puppy getting a microchip. No idea why the shelter and my vet couldn't find it but my dog had one at some point.

Here's the part where I might be TA.I told the woman I appreciated the great job she did with my dog for the first few years of her life (she's 5) and I was sorry to hear about her circumstances but I couldn't give up my beloved girl. She's my support animal so I'm not even sure I could live without her. I offered to send her pictures regularly but she turned really nasty. I got tons of hateful messages from people I don't even know.

I had panic attacks whenever I got notifications because her friends acted like it's my fault. I didn't choose for this special dog to change my life so much anymore than she chose for my dog to get lost. I ultimately blocked her because she wouldn't leave me alone.

Since she was listed with the shelter for the hold period and no microchip was found, I've adopted her and she's mine. I am legally in the right but am I morally wrong? I know she loves my dog and wants her back but I can't picture a life without her. Not one where I'm happy anyway. If I could clone my dog and give this chick one I would.

UPDATE: AITA for installing a keylogger in my son's computer?,13744,UPDATE,466,hdzji1,1592884623.0,"Original thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gtylfd/aita_for_installing_a_keylogger_in_my_sons/)

So... this blew up. I read all the comments and I really appreciate the insight on both sides, which I will not comment nor give my opinion on since a veredict is a veredict. Each person is entitled to their own opinion, but I want you to know that I took into consideration all of them, even with the majority considering me an asshole.

It took me two days of pondering, especially with the threat of my niece telling Jack everything, before I sat him down and talked to him. I came out clean, told him about the keylogger, then explained to him what it did, why I did it, and how it worked. Jack believed me when I told him I had never looked at anything. We both shared a laugh when he told me he believed me because a)I am a complete airhead so it is perfectly believable I forgot about the keylogger for years and b) he admitted to having watched porn, and he is sure I would have commented on it, because both my sister and I both openly dislike the porn industry.

He told me he isn't mad at me, that he's glad I told him about it now instead of, say, twenty years from now, and that he would have done the same thing in my situation, keylogger and everything. I showed him how to remove it and how to look for it in further devices, and we had a look at a few laptops together. I ended up buying him a new one and helped him set it up (yes, no keyloggers). He let me know the password he used, in case it was necessary.

Regarding my niece, she didn't tell him anything, but my sister and I had a conversation with them at the same time over dinner. My niece used the same argument as many of you did, with it being the same as reading a diary, and it was one that both my sister and I agreed with. My sister was admittedly much stricter with her daughter than I was with my son, since she checked her texts and Instagram/Facebook/Whatsapp messages, but she admitted it was because of her massive fear that everything that is uploaded to the internet lasts forever, and she was afraid of things like nudes being leaked, undesired contact with bad people, cyberbullying or any possible hurtful things. They ended up agreeing to disagreeing and my sister promised to start trusting my niece more with these things, since she knows she won't be able to do anything about it once she turns eighteen.

I want to thank you all for the feedback and for your suggestions over how I should handle this, even the ones who called me an asshole. I felt like I owed you this update.",False,False,2020-06-22 20:57:03
AITA for responding sarcastically when offered minimum wage for teaching cello lessons from a wealthy family-friend?,13719,Not the A-hole,1336,fm4twl,1584774726.0,"Some context: I (23 M) am a college student who lives close to home and I’m a cellist. I’m not that good but I have made a bit of money on the side playing at weddings and churches and the occasional local orchestra group. My parents have some friends who are incredibly wealthy and have a young family. 

A few weeks ago I was at my parents house and mother of said family approaches me and asks me if I would teach her son to play the cello. I accepted. Then she says she’ll give me $7.25 for an hour lesson every week. Now for those of you who’ve never paid for a music lesson, I paid my music teacher $40 an hour (who I’ll admit is a significantly better musician than I). 

So I said, “Maybe I’d babysit your kid for minimum wage but definitely not a music lesson.”

Anyways, she gets really upset but doesn’t say anything to me directly and complains to my parents. They go on to me about how she didn’t know any better and I shouldn’t be a prick to their friend and how I wasn’t a damn pro at the cello that I shouldn’t expect a ton of money since I’m not that reputable. Like I know I’m an amateur and all, but she drove to our house in a fucking Tesla. AITA?

Edit:

Wow, I didn’t expect so many responses. Decided I’d go ahead and call the lady and apologize for being impolite.

AITA for locking a kid in the bathroom?,13702,Not the A-hole,1526,d5vl6n,1568830132.0,"I(26F) am single and currently living in an apartment with my cat. Next door lives what looks like a single mother(40+-) and her son(8). I work early shifts, so I am usually home in the afternoons and would spend the rest of the day playing video games or painting.

The mother next door sometimes would drop her son by my door and ask me to look after him as she goes out, she would usually pick him up a few hours later. I am actually quite reluctant to help but consider that they may be in difficult situations I just suck it up. It’s not like I have to babysit or entertain him, just letting him play my video games for a few hours and that’s all. The son sometimes makes a mess by rummaging through my things but I could handle that by telling him off and tidy them up later. 

It was another one of the days when I let the son in and left him be. For a while everything seemed to be fine, until I realized that my cat was missing. I looked everywhere but she was nowhere to be seen. I then turned to the kid and asked if he had anything to do with it, but he was busy with his game and brushed me off impatiently. Some time later, I found my terrified cat in the FREEZER.

I confronted the kid and demanded to know why he did that? He swore to god that he had nothing to do with it at first, then changed his words and said that the cat jumped in when he took some ice for his drinks. I then ignored his protests and locked him in the bathroom for the rest of his stay till his mother came to pick him up.

Not surprisingly the mother was furious about how I treated her son. I told her that I did it for the safety of my cat because I found her precious kid trying to kill her. She argued that I could have locked up my cat instead, in which I replied that I had no obligation looking after her son in the first place. She threatened to press charges against me before storming away with her son. 

I shared this with my friends and while some said I should have rejected them a long time ago, others said I went too far. What do you think?


Edit: I need to point out that the agreement to ""look after"" the kid was that I only needed to allow him inside and play video games and he stays till his mother returns. I am no ""babysitter"" and I made it clear to the mother, in which she agreed to it and still asked for my help.

AITA for wanting to send my teen daughter to a weight loss camp?,13696,No A-holes here,1607,dxprju,1574041808.0,"My daughter (15) is 5'6 and the last time she weighed herself at the doctor's office she was at 238lbs. She is morbidly obese.

She was always a chubby kid who loved food and hated activity no matter how much her dad and I tried to get her to dance, play sports, go on walks with our dog etc. she would refuse. I regret not taking her to a nutritionist earlier, but I thought that she would go into puberty and her weight would eventually be okay. Unfortunately, when she was 11 her dad and I decided to get a divorce. No special reason, it just wasn't working. We coparent well, we're friendly, we go on trips with out daughter etc., but the divorce impacted her negatively at first. 

She started gaining a lot of weight around that time so we decided to take her to a nutritionist who recommended therapy for her. She initially lost about 15lbs but she was already very dependent on food. Now, she's a food addict. Her emotional eating was something she used to cope with the divorce until she adjusted, but now it's all about compensating for not having friends, compensating for not being ''pretty'', compensating for not being liked by boys etc. 

She still goes to therapy regularly, she doesn't suffer from depression or another health condition that might cause her weight gain, she is simply addicted to food and at her vulnerable age, mentioning her weight to her makes her very upset and uncomfortable. Her dad and I both know this and it's been causing arguments between us. I'm a very active, fit person and I try to lead by example - no junk food allowed in the house, I cook as much as I can or I get healthy meal delivery - and this makes me the bad guy.

She's into the whole body acceptance movement and she sold the story to her dad who now allows her to raid his pantry and they eat junk together just so he wouldn't upset her because she's daddy's little girl. He's happy that he gets to be the good guy and I'm the villain who doesn't want her daughter to settle because I want her to live past 35. I encourage her to love herself, I want her to embrace how amazing she is but I don't want her to accept her condition as something normal that can't be changed. I'm tired seeing how miserable she is because of her weight and I'm tired of thinking about all the diseases that could kill her. 

I found a great weight management treatment facility (*edited instead of camp because it's very different from the infamous fat camps) for teens that's 6 hours away, I've done my research but her dad doesn't want to sign for her to go there from January to July. We can visit her and she can come home once a month, she can go to school there, make friends and get healthy. He says that I'm being a selfish asshole and that our daughter doesn't want to go. She told me that she will think about it but I think that her dad is loving his role as her superhero because they've bonded in the past months, and will encourage her not to go.

AITA?

__EDIT:__ Lots of repetitive question and comments. Please look through my comment history, thank you.

__EDIT2:__ Again, I've explained everything about this treatment facility, her current therapy and approach to her eating disorder, the fact that the choice is ultimately hers, yes we do have a dog and no she doesn't want to walk him, no this isn't a quick fix, no I don't think my daughter hates me.

__EDIT3:__ I sound like a broken record, put please read through my comments before asking the same things over and over! There's a word limit here and obviously not everything fits in the post. The facility does have therapists, specialists, doctors and all types of health professionals. They do have ED programs that she would be a part of and she would be in touch with her current therapist because she has a hard time opening up to new people, so that would help her. I double and triple checked everything and talked to so many parents and employees, but it's ultimately her choice. My fear is that her dad will cloud her judgment by bribing her with food.

__EDIT4:__ Thank you guys for all of your responses. I've received a lot of great advice, your own experience with ED, personal stories, support and empathy. I appreciate all of it. I'll no longer be replying to comments because I find myself trying too hard to reach people who are twisting my words and using them against me.

I got home to my roommate Brad stuffing all of my towels (he grabbed all of mine because like a man he only has one constantly moist and dirty towel) in black garbage bags. You see Brad has a online side hustle going and apparently one of his weirdo clients asked him to record himself unceremoniously man-handling himself with towels. Since he was paying, Brad obliged.

AITA for shouting at a family of tourists for blaming me because I misinterpreted something?,13688,Not the A-hole,1815,ev4mbb,1580241193.0,"So while waiting for school to start, my friend and I decided take up a part time job by handing out flyers.

One day we were approached by a family of tourists asking for directions to the nearest subway. In my country we don't use the term subway as a substitute for trains but associate it to the sandwich food chain. So we gave them directions to the nearest subway and continued with our job.

30 minutes later they came back to us, clearly pissed and scolded us for wasting their time by giving wrong directions, so I pulled out my phone and went to Google maps to show them that there is in fact a subway where I directed them to.

Then they looked at me and said straight to my face ""are you stupid, we meant trains, you've caused us to be late, learn some better English would you"" what they said, to me seems pretty racist because I'm Asian and it sounds like they're assuming that I don't know proper English despite English is the first language everyone born in my country learns first.

I tried to calm them down by saying I'm sorry and that we don't use the term subway to refer to trains here and if they need directions they could've ask the tourist information centre right opposite us in the first place.

After that the man just said ""damned china people"" (although I'm not even from China) and walked away.

Hearing that was the last straw and I just shouted ""go back to your own country then cunts, we don't need poeple like you here""

Keep in mind that they came to ask directions from my friend and I who are both 16 and are obviously not obligated to help them and also there's a tourist information centre literally a few steps away and they blamed us.

We just aren't materialistic people, we never shop for the sake of shopping, (ex. I only have 2/3 pairs of jeans, but if one is worn out/ too old I would buy another that might be considered overpriced in the 100-250$ range, but will last for a longer time. None of us go shopping as a hobby or for fun)

My older brother lives in LA, and was dating this girl for a long time. She has a BA, makes about 40/50k a year. We thought she was very nice and very sweet, but some of the things she said felt odd. Once she came home with our brother, saw our parents cars out front (Audi and jag). My brother told her that our parents only ever had used cars that were a little run down, and soaked in crackers/spilled juice/soccer sweat from practice etc so when our youngest sibling finished high school our parents decided to treat themselves for once in their entire lives and bought new cars  (after working 80 hour weeks and grinding for most their lives). She laughed and said ""it better not take you more than a few years to buy me one of those (my brother drives a relatively new jeep)

My brother decided to propose and had me help pick it out. We decided to get her one with a middle stone that was 2.5 carats, with a baguette on each side that was about 1 carat each. Brother proposed she said yes but she was upset, saying she expected a bigger ring since he makes enough to buy her 5k ring, and that she can't handle him acting cheap all the time. He was really upset about this because this ring cost about 40k and was amazing clarity, colour etc. and he researched it excessively and made sure that it was the exact design ring she wanted. He called me and got mad at me because I was the one who said he should get the main stone to be 2.5k because bigger than that looks a little tacky and showy. I told him that this is probably God waving a red flag and giving him a chance to get out. I told him that someone who can't appreciate that 40k (esp since thats how much she makes a year), is a lot to spend on a ring. She didn't care about how hard he tried to please her, just about the money. He thought it over and agreed and broke it off. She called me after he asked her to move out and told me I was a meddling bitch and my brother will never get married when his family is so nosey. I asked my friends about it and they agreed, they said that you only get one engagement ring and she should get the ring she wants. So reddit AITA?

&#x200B;

**EDIT** So to clarify the ring had a centre stone of 2.5 carats, and a baguette on either side of 1 carat each. It was just under 40k. Some people are bringing up how crazy the price was. Our parents really struggled in their beginning as they are immigrants, so they would be going to school while raising 4 kids and things were tough. So we were always naturally frugal but our parents splurged on important things for us and on life experiences, not on buying material possessions. But they did emphasize to us to never be cheap when it comes to presents or paying the bill. So with this ring, my brother didn't have a budget he was just going for quality. He makes mid to high 6 figures (we all make around that), but I said we don't consider ourselves rich because we don't act like it (always fly economy, only our parents have luxury cars, we don't buy designer clothes/shoes/bag except for maybe some items for work because the environment demands it but we don't go on shopping sprees). Our parents told him though to make sure he picked something special because his wife will be the mother of his children, a sister to his siblings, their new daughter, and his partner in life. So he kind of wanted this to be a family heirloom to be passed on to a future child as well. But the way she acted I think he was too focussed on making sure that his future partner was happy he missed all those red flags.

He DID get the ring back though. I know people think she's a huge gold digger and we should have seen it earlier. But my brother met her while he was at Stanford at a party and she was from UC Berkley so we all figured someone who goes to a fancy school like that would rather focus on their own goals than leech off someone else. I guess we were wrong hahah

**EDIT 2**People are apparently pressed about the way I described us as not rich. Its just pretty hard to see yourself as wealthy when you grew up with your parents constantly stressed about not being able to pay rent, always having hand me downs, sharing a two bedroom apartment with 5 other people, being okay with the fact that beans on toast would be dinner a lot of nights, never going to a sit down restaurant until you were 12 years old. Just because we're doing okay now doesn't mean we don't know how it feels to be worried that you might not have a place to live next month. I'm not asking you to judge our financial status (I only added those details because I felt  it was relevant to judging how we view money as opposed to how she does). **I only came on here to see if I was TA for involving myself in someone else's relationship.**

AITA for eating a lot at a wedding buffet?,13674,Asshole,3108,d7ee4u,1569120096.0,"I (17M) eat a good amount of food. Based on my body type and physical activity, I've been eating well over 4,000 calories a day to maintain my current weight.

My aunt got married last weekend in a venue close to my parents' house. It was originally scheduled for the morning, but problems with catering and the venue/DJ meant that they rescheduled it for that evening at the last minute.

This was problematic because I needed to attend my afternoon swim practice that day, as I had only been excused for the morning one. I ended up going to both practices, had to change into my tux right outside the weight room, and drove directly there. I only ate a protein bar during the drive, so I was thrilled to find a well-stocked buffet after the reception.

I loaded my plate, then went back for seconds. I was going to get a third round when my mom pulled me aside. She had been giving me weird looks during the meal, and told me to cut it out, and that if I was still hungry I could make something when we got home.

Now, I would have ordinarily agreed with her, but when we helped chip in for the wedding, we paid for two meals instead of one for me. I ate a good amount, but I doubt it was more than double whatever everyone else was eating.

She eventually gave in and let me get a third serving. I would have eaten more, but she put her foot down. There was still some extra food left once the meal service ended.

Once we left, my mom went on a rant about how I was ""making aunt and her fiancee fund my cheat day."" I told her that it was the guests paying for the catering, not them, and I wasn't depriving anyone else since I went back for more once most people were done.

I'm not sure if I violated some social norm, but I feel like I was justified. AITA, Reddit?

AITA for telling my cousin that his kids may not want to be around him when he's old?,13674,Not the A-hole,605,h8u6kz,1592171474.0,"I'm a 37 year old female and I have made a conscious decision to not have kids. Parenthood just isn't for me. Most people don't give me trouble for this. My cousin, a 38 year old  father of 5 (yes 5 kids!) is not among them. He and I have never liked each other. Mostly because he's a homophobic, misogynistic little prick. He forced his wife to give up her career because ""it just doesn't look right if the woman earns more than the man"". I know for a fact that his wife wanted to stop at 3 kids, but he coerced her into having another 2.

&#x200B;

 She looks miserable. I'm guessing it's partly because of the stress of raising 5 kids and taking care of their house all by herself and partly because my cousin talks down to her in front of people and is an all round scumbag. He also had an affair a few years ago, but she stayed with him. Why I have no idea. Anytime my parents and other relatives have called him out on the way he treats his wife, he just listens with a shit eating smirk on his face. 

&#x200B;

Cousin also has a problem with my lifestyle. I have a successful career that I love, I have 2 great dogs and in my free time I like to volunteer at a local animal shelter. He often comments that I'm wasting my life away on ""silly"" things like my work and caring for animals and I should be more focused on getting married and having kids. He often refers to me as an ""old maid"" because I'm single and childfree. Of course when I point out that he's turned into a land whale, I'm the bad guy. 

&#x200B;

The only reason I haven't cut ties with him is because I want to be a part of his kids' lives, and I want to be there for his wife who is a lovely person and, over the years, has become a good friend of mine. 

&#x200B;

Now, on to the incident. Yesterday evening I was facetiming with cousin's wife and was telling her about something funny and cute my mastiff does (he likes to lie on his back and upside down smile at me like a big goof). Cousin was sitting next to her and heard what I had said. He snorted and said ""those animals are not gonna take care of you when you're old. You're gonna die alone in a nursing home if you don't do the natural thing and have kids soon."" 

&#x200B;

His wife looked embarrassed. I was pissed. That's when I told him that he could end up alone too. His kids may not want to be around the insufferable dickhead that he is. They may realize what a weak excuse for a human being he is and may want nothing to do with him, given that they witness how he treats their mother. 

&#x200B;

He looked like he had been slapped. He began yelling at me and his wife ended the call. This morning she called me and told me she understood why I had said what I said, but that I may have gone a little to far. I told her I was sorry if I had offended her, but I meant what I said about her husband.

WIBTA to refuse biodad who terminated rights to contact my daughter after he became infertile?,13654,Not the A-hole,1091,gp2h6s,1590257352.0,"I (F30), am a dual American/Australian citizen who grew up with an international custody order where I’d bounce back and forth between Dad (White American) and Mum (Indigenous Australian) from between age 12-17. As part of this arrangement, my final year of schooling was to be completed in Australia, so I could also take part in cultural activities from Mum’s side of the family. 

When I was 15-16 years old, I fell pregnant in America, to my then boyfriend, and I didn’t realise until I was back home in Australia. When I eventually told my mother, she and my father decided to support me, but took my passport until I was a legal adult, to stop me from making any foolish decisions. With both my parents support, I subsequently made phone calls and contacted the father of my daughter.

The biodad of my child was also 15/16 and didn’t want to be involved at all. He said some very hurtful things during this time, calling my daughter a “half breed” and other racially-based slurs when we broke up over the phone. Eventually, when my daughter was young, biodad voluntarily terminated rights when my daughter was 5. He never willingly saw her, stopped contacting me, never paid child support, and never asked about her. In part, his parents also voiced that this was the best move, to stop him from ruining his life. 

Daughter has been adopted by my now husband. We have told her age-appropriate things relating to this.

My daughter is now 14 (soon 15) and a mutual friend from America sent me a message that biodad has gotten into an accident a year ago, and he’d recently found out that he can no longer father biological children. He’s been sending messages to mutual friends asking for my contact information to get in touch with my daughter. He says “he deserves to have biological children”. No one has sent him anything, and I trust them not to.

AITA for not letting my wife borrow my car anymore,13644,Not the A-hole,3263,dsesds,1573067084.0,"Hello redditors

Me and my wife are both in our 40s and we've been married for about 15 years. I'm very passionated about sports cars and I own for the time being only a sports car. This led my wife to borrowing this car for the last 6 months whenever she needed to get somewhere. I care for the car a lot as it was both expensive and was bought as a ""milestone"" in life that I've worked very hard for. Well, here is the problem she damaged it about 2 months ago (minor dent) that I was able to fix for not too much money at a local shop. Now, one week ago she managed to damage it again and this time we're going to have to order this part which comes out to about 2-3k.

So I told her that she will no be allowed to drive it anymore as I neither want to pay for the repairs or want to repair the car as it will affect the value when I sell it if it has been repaired a lot etc.

So she got really upset about this and I told her that she should get her own car when she wants to go to the city to do shopping. This blew into a pretty big fight and even though I didn't budge and we kinda sorted it out I still feel like she is pissed at me. So..

Edit: To clarify: the sports car is the only car that I currently own, I used to have another car but I sold it. I've planned on getting another car for her to use as we had before in the future.

Context update:  It's not like we barely have any money to spare. She makes over $100k a year (she makes a bit more than I do). And could go and buy a car today if she wanted to. The problem is just the fact that I don't let her drive MY car which is pissing her off.

Edit 2: Saw this post blow up and thanks for all the replies. Some made me think again on how this played out and I just wanted to answer a few questions here instead of replying to every single comment on the post.

1. My wife do not use the car to get to work, she gets picked up by her driver. Yes driver. lol. (Provided by her work).
2. She only uses the car when she wants to go shopping, we live in the city so it is only used when she is shopping ""heavy things"".
3. We've talked several times about her getting a car which she always postpones for some reason.
4. Yes, I did ""warn"" her that I would not want her to be driving the car the first time she dented it.
5. I do no treat my wife as a child.
6. We have our own personal things that we own, she has a horse. The horse is HERS not mine. The car is MINE not hers. I'm not sure where all of you are from where everything in a marriage is splitted 50/50. We also own things together of course.
7. The reason I sold my ""other"" car is that I felt I already spent so much on this new car and I didn't want to have two cars when we do not use them for anything else but me hobby driving and her occasional shopping and some other minor things.
8. A lot of people wanna know, the car is a 2017 911 991 Turbo
9. I'm not a multimillionaire and neither is she. That is the reason for why I'm not (as some people suggests) ""go out and buy her a car and get over with it"". I saved up for many many years for the car. I don't have money to buy another decent car for her to use without stretching my budget very very far.
10. A lot of people asking regarding the ""driver who picks her up"" and it not making sense earning 100k. I'm not sure it is normal at other companies but at hers they offer this service. My wife makes well over 100k, the reason I said 100k is because it thought it would be enough to prove my point that she can afford a car. She makes somewhere around 250. I make around 175. We have a lot of expenses, 5 kids all going to go to uni at some point so we're also saving for these types of things and therefore a lot of the money we make is automatically put into these funds and only a small portion goes into ""our own"" saving accounts. This is where I during the course of many many years saved up for my car, also we did not earn this much our entire lives. 
11. Both the times she damaged the car it was in our parking garage, her fault. Nobody else but her and the concrete pillars involved.

"AITA For not telling my brother, who was on his honeymoon, that our father died?",13632,Asshole,2598,g0qpwp,1586837772.0,"Throwaway. This took place awhile ago but the fallout is still hot. My father had health problems for the last few years and he recently succumbed to them.. During this time my brother had gotten married and was on his honeymoon.

I made the choice to be the one to inform my brother of the news. Our mother died years ago, so I am the only one left in our family that's closest to him. I told any other distant family members to refrain from letting him know until I say it's okay.

I decided in all fairness, that he should get to enjoy his honeymoon with his new wife, and I decided not to tell him until he gets back.

We had a few gatherings and then the funeral happened. Some people were wondering why my brother wasn't there and I explained the situation that he is on his honeymoon. A few people thought it was the right thing to let him enjoy it, others thought I should have told my brother, so I guess that is where the divide began.

A few days after the funeral my brother came out and I quickly texted him that our father died. He almost immediately called me up and was freaking out, understandably. I expected he would be surprised, but he sounded flabbergasted as if our father had no health problems prior to his death. I told him that this was going to happen eventually.

He asked when the funeral would be and I explained to him that we already had it and then he started screaming at me on the phone and cursing at me. I hung up on him until he could calm down.

However since then, I have made repeated attempts to call him back but he has refused my calls. I understand he has the right to be mad but he should also understand I did it so he wouldn't be stressing over what would be a happy time in his life.",True,False,2020-04-13 21:16:12
AITA for not caring that my ex-wife had baby?,13616,Not the A-hole,1358,gml9rh,1589909156.0,"So I (31M) got married to Emily (31F) when we were 20, we separated at 26 and our divorce was finally finalised at 28. It was incredibly drawn out and messy as there was infidelity on her part and she kept refusing to sign papers and wanting to work on our marriage even though she was still with the guy she was cheating with. I checked out as soon as she told me and just wanted to get divorced. It finally happened and I then started dating my current girlfriend Sandy (30F) a few months later. I should add, this marriage produced no kids.

So about 6 months ago, I became a dad for the first time, yay! Sandy and I had a little boy called Theo. I didn’t tell Emily this because frankly, why would I? I have no reason to have her in my life. My sister Grace (29) still is on good terms with Emily and I have no issue with that as long as I’m not involved. Anyway, I get a random message one day from Emily congratulating me on being a dad. I figured Grace probably told her which was true and I found out Grace even sent pictures of my son I’d sent to her to Emily! I told Grace it’s fine if she wants to be friends with Emily but it’s not cool if she sends pictures of my newborn son to my ex wife. Sandy was pissed too and Grace apologised and hasn’t sent any more pictures or info I don’t want shared.

Well, I thought I wouldn’t hear from Emily again until she told me about a month after my son was born that she was pregnant with the guy she left me for. All I said was a generic “congratulations” and she got mad that was all I had to say. I just said to her we’re not in each other’s lives and that why would I really care? That kid was nothing to do with me. She tried messaging me again and I ignored her.

The other day, Emily messages me again and tells me she had a girl called Hayley. Alright, that’s cool. I offered another congratulations and thought that’d be it. She then started trying talking to me about us both finding happiness and becoming first time parents within months of each other and I honestly was not interested in talking to her. She then started talking constantly and constantly about her baby and sent me pictures and I had no reaction. She then asked me why I wasn’t excited for her and I just decided to be totally honest. I just said to her “look, it’s great you’re excited about being a mom but we’ve been divorced for years. Why are you sharing details about your baby with me? I don’t really care because you and me aren’t involved in each other’s lives anymore.”

I then finally blocked her from messaging me and I ended up getting a shitty message from my sister. She said I was an AH for putting down Emily like that when she was trying to tell me all about her new baby. Maybe my delivery was a bit harsh but am I really in the wrong for not caring my ex had a kid?

Update: I did mention in paragraph one that Sandy is my girlfriend since a few people have commented that I’m married again. I am not, I have a girlfriend who is Sandy and who my baby son is with.

Update 2: Grace knows Emily’s long-term bf started with an affair behind my back. She knows how awful Emily was when I was trying to get our divorce and all about the cheating.

Update 3: people seem to be under the impression I am still talking to Emily. No, she contacted me once about her pregnancy which I responded to and she tried a few times after but I didn’t answer. Then I responded when she had her baby. I have literally talked to her twice and that was it before I blocked her.

Also, I’m trying to reply to as much people as I can but the consensus seems to be I need to talk to my sister properly, Emily is trying to cheat with me and that I’m in no way the AH so thanks for the still active comments!

Update 4: to those wondering, I learnt from Grace that Emily was at least 4 months pregnant when she told me so she did have a full term pregnancy I guess.

My husband of 10 years had an affair that lasted approximately 6 months.

I understood that if she gave birth, my husband would have to do his part in supporting that child (at the very least, financially).  

Tragically though, the baby was stillborn. I wasn’t looking forward to this baby coming but I didn’t wish for this either. My husband’s former mistress has sent details about the funeral.

"AITA for snapping at another woman (I'm also a woman) after she referred to my husband as her ""gay best friend""?",13560,Not the A-hole,665,fie3bu,1584195334.0,"To clarify some things, my husband and I are both bisexual. No one can usually tell that about me, but on the otherhand my husband is very feminine, ""flamboyant"" and basically the stereotypical gay man. He also speaks with the so-called ""gay voice"". Almost everyone assumes that he is gay when they first meet him, unless I'm there to introduce myself as his wife. 
What I'm trying to say here is that yes, it's very easy to perceive my husband as gay and not bisexual, and that is not the reason why I snapped.

My husband has this straight female coworker, let's call her Sarah (obviously fake name). The first time I met Sarah was at a party, where all of this went down. My husband had never met up with her outside of work, and the few times he had mentioned her was mostly him complaining about her being too clingy and overbearing at work. He described her acting in a way which, to me, sounded a lot like she had a crush on him. 

During the party, me and a few other people started chatting. Sarah was one of those people. The LGBT topic came up (can't remember how) and I mentioned that I was bisexual. To that, Sarah says ""oh, I have a gay bff, his name is [insert my husband's name]!"" 
I asked if it was [husband's name] from [husband's workplace], and she said yes.
I told her that clearly he didn't consider her to be his bff, as otherwise she would've known that he is bisexual and married to a woman. She looked taken aback and asked me for proof about him being 1) bisexual and 2) married. I just pointed at my wedding ring. A few of the people with us (mostly me and my husband's mutual friends) burst out laughing, and Sarah looked extremely humiliated.

Well, after that went down my husband never complained about Sarah being too clingy/overbearing again, so I guess something positive came out of it. What made me snap was that I knew that this was the woman who had been making my husband's work days more stressful by being so clinged to him. But my intention was never to humiliate her in front of other people, and that makes me feel like I might be TA.

AITA?

Edit: Some of you have asked why hasn't my husband told her that he's married. My husband isn't even friends with Sarah, they're just coworkers. According to my husband, they've never had any kind of meaningful conversation together where something like that might come up. I don't think that it's odd, as I have never mentioned to any of my colleagues that I'm married unless the topic specifically came up or if I tell a story which includes my husband.

We were outside for a couple of hours and my skin got slightly darker. His mother told me that my skin looked ""dirty"".

I've always grown up around white people. His parents fucking accuse me of ""trying to act white"". This is just my personality. I can't change the way I speak or act. I wore high waisted jeans and I overheard them saying that those type of jeans are for white girls. His mom said that she hopes her grandkids are born white.

The only time my boyfriend calls them out is if they use the N word. My name starts with ""Sa"" and his dad thinks calling me ""San\*gger"" is the peak of comedy.

We were all watching beyond scared straight and his dad said that a white kid was ""just going through a phase"" and then called a black kid ""a thug"". His dad kept looking over at me for an reaction so I gave him one. I asked him why he's excusing the white kids behaviour while name calling a black child. He dismissed what I said and said ""It's so sad that some kids throw their lives away so fast"" I said ""It's sad that some people are in their 40's but are still biased based off of skin color."" His dad got really mad and stormed out with his mom. My boyfriend got mad at me and asked why the hell I said that. I told him that I'm not going to just sit here and let his parents be racist for no reason.

I'm not a SJW. I'm pretty chill but his parents were purposely being rude and offensive. I've been dealing with shit like this for a month now. My boyfriend said I overreacted and disrespected his parents. I don't think I have any obligation to be nice or respectful to people who won't do the same for me.

Am I the asshole? I have trouble with feelings of worthlessness and I'm kind of used to being treated poorly for my race. I know I'm being treated badly but I don't know if it was my place to call them out. My low self esteem (BPD) makes it hard to believe that I don't deserve this. I know it's stupid.

EDIT: I literally have no choice but to live with them. I'm from south carolina and my boyfriends from louisiana. I got fired from my job because of coronavirus so I can't afford a different place. My grandma is living in my parents house so there's no room for me. I also don't want to move in and risk exposing my highrisk grandmother to anything.

AITA for refusing to feed my 6 year old son vegan food?,13538,Not the A-hole,1006,ecfzr8,1576720432.0,"My ex girlfriend and I have a little boy, he’s 6. I have him as much as I can, 4 days a week usually. 

My ex girlfriend used to be a meat eater but since she got a new bf they’re into this vegan lifestyle which is great for her. She feeds my son vegan food at her place which is cool, however at my place I’ll feed him what I eat, which a lot of the time is veg based but has elements of meat in there. Like Brussels sprouts roasted with bacon or lard, or veggie rice fried with sausage. 

My ex gf is insisting that I should feed him vegan, however in my opinion I feel that what he eats with me is my choice. If I can make his meal vegan easily I will, if not I’ll feed him what I eat. 
 
She is not happy with that and is insisting I make a full vegan change otherwise she will send her own snacks for him. I said that’s fine but if my son wants to or prefers to eat what I’m eating I won’t ever stop him from eating non vegan.",True,False,2019-12-18 17:53:52
AITA For telling my brother-in-law that he ruined me and my husband’s wedding night?,13501,Not the A-hole,1717,dao9jd,1569746237.0,"A bit of backstory, my husband’s brother (we’ll call him Tony) is the youngest in their sibling trio. Tony is 29 and got married about 3 years ago. When Tony married his wife, before my now husband and I met, my husband (Larry) did a little “prank” on Tony’s wedding night. Larry got some of that washable car window paint and wrote “just married” on the back and put balloons under a tarp in the bed of the trunk to be lifted. Larry also placed a few boxes of condoms in the truck to be funny. I’ve seen pictures of this myself, if I can find them, I will attach them in an edit. 

Flash forward to my husband and I’s wedding night, as we were returning to my husbands truck, we noticed Tony did a “prank” of his own. He covered my husbands truck in pink washable paint, put personal lubricant all over the outside and stuck feminine hygiene products all over it. He also threw condoms out of the package inside the truck, threw glitter on both the inside and the outside of the truck, and confetti. 

My husband and I were outraged, we saw this as going too far and also made my 11 year old daughter very uncomfortable. Tony didn’t see the problem and neither did the family, they all thought it was hilarious. We drove the truck back to the hotel and spent hours cleaning the inside. 

While we were cleaning, I called Tony and very calmly explained to him that he upset Larry and I and that we had to spend hours cleaning it. I also explained that the wash on the outside of the truck wasn’t going to be cheap, to which Tony said, “use the money I gave you guys for your wedding present for that then.” Which angered me more and I hung up on him. I did not cuss at him nor did I yell. 

After we spent nearly $50 cleaning the exterior of the truck, I got a very nasty call from Tony in which he called me a b*tch, couldn’t take a joke, and worst of all, felt bad for my daughter that i had an uptight woman like me as her mother. I didn’t say anything back, I just hung up. 

The next day, I wake up to texts from his family saying that I was too harsh on Tony, that Tony drove 7hrs for our wedding, and he was just “getting Larry back” for what happened at his wedding. Larry told me that he actually deleted texts that Tony sent me over night because he was “embarrassed by what his brother said.” 

I refuse to talk to Tony and so does my husband until we get an apology for what he did and said. I apologized to Tony for perhaps being too harsh, which I admit, wasn’t a genuine apology. But, I expected an apology back. Instead I got more “poor me” from Tony. Larry &amp;amp; Tony’s parents texted me saying I need to “stop creating drama” and step back and think about how this makes Tony feel. But, I think my ignoring Tony is valid as what he said before was very hurtful. 

I’ve been called an asshole by Tony himself. And i’m wondering if there’s something here that I’m missing

AITA?


**UPDATE: Brother-in-law posted to Facebook with a totally false story**

[and here’s what he posted](https://m.imgur.com/a/t6qGLj8) 

So, I thought there were two photos according to my mother posted on Facebook but it’s just this one. That only shows the front of the truck before the vaseline/pink paint/rest of the sanitary products were added. Brother-in-law posted that “I [Tony] welcomed OP to the family with open arms and she cussed me out then insulted me!”

Yeah, *I’m sorry, what?* I did **not** cuss him out nor did I insult him as my young daughter was around. He also added, “OP should get over herself as it wasn’t even that bad.” Yeah, good job cherry picking what you wanted everyone to see. Only his wife, their sister, and their father saw the actual final product with us when we did. Everyone else in the family, this is all their seeing and they now have the perspective that I cussed out *poor Tony*. 

I asked Larry what the deleted messages said and Larry told me the gist of it was, “OP and her daughter will never really be apart of this family.” And Larry said thats the less insulting way to put it. 

I’m sorry if this seems rude but I am very upset as Tony just threw more gasoline at an already ignited flame. Larry said that he’s going to take care of it from here and that if I get involved more, Tony is just going to make more lies up. 

Anyway, I appreciate everyone’s replies! A lot were very helpful, Larry and I are definitely going to apply some of the advice given. I’m still refusing to speak to Tony until he apologizes to what he said about myself and my daughter including embarrassing her when a condom fell on her in the truck. Hopefully things work out soon! I don’t want to start off my entrance to this family badly, either. Thanks again!

Edit: You can see one of the condoms in the truck actually and some of the streamers and glitter. It might not be high-res, sorry. There is two tampons and a pad visible in the photo.

Edit 2: I’m sorry, I did not take any photos of the final product of the truck, I should’ve. I was still pretty fuming from everything else though, I didnt really think of it. I’m going to ask Larry if he has any screenshots of the texts.",False,1569774227.0,2019-09-29 01:37:17
AITA for not buying a tv after my mom told me I'd have to put it in the living room?,14085,Not the A-hole,1067,fvt8si,1586181475.0," I'm (20M) in the market for a new TV, the 32 inch Sharp TV I have still runs fine but I want something bigger, I have my eyes on a 65 inch LG Smart TV, I saved up for it and had plans to buy it but my mom told me that if I bought a TV when I already have a perfectly working TV then I'd have to put it in the living room so that everyone (my parents and sibs) can enjoy it.

She said that it was selfish and that I don't need a TV that big for my room especially when I already have one. I said fine and a couple weeks passed and she asked me when I'm buying the TV, I told her that I'm not buying one anymore and she asked why and I said there's no point for me to spend my hard-earned money for a TV that I'm not even allowed to put in my own room.

She went on a tirade about how I'm the most selfish person in the world and that I was selfish to buy a TV in the first place with the intention of putting it in my room and that now the only reason I'm not buying the TV is because I don't want to share.

AITA? I don't know what I did wrong. What's the point of me buying a huge TV when I can't even fully benefit it?

Edit: Yes, I pay rent and buy my own food

Edit 2: I've been sitting here reading all your replies and message from different people, I guess I was too close to the situation to see that my parents are essentially using me as a cash cow for the rent I guess, I thought paying the majority of the rent like I did was normal but according to some people my parents are taking advantage of me.

I'm talking to a friend right now who is in need of a roommate, I'd be paying a quarter of the rent that I pay here and all utilities are split 50/50

Some people asked, I have my own bank account that neither of my parents can access, and I also have all my important documents safely tucked away.

I'm trying to find the courage to pull the trigger and tell my friend that I'm interested in moving in with him and if anything else happens I'll be sure to update you guys

Also, regarding my siblings, 1 is 18 and could move out, the other is a minor, I want to get them out but this opportunity with my roommate is too good to pass up as some of you have put it

Mini Update: a lot has happened in the past 13 hours since I posted my question and you guys have helped me open my eyes to the borderline abuse that I didn't even realize I was facing, I decided to reach out and I called my aunt (moms sister) I told her about the TV situation and the abuse towards my siblings and the way I was raised up and she was appalled, she has a spacious house that is paid off and her and her husband are more than happy to let me stay with them and let me and my two sisters move in.

Even though there are obvious worldly events going on, we are still planning on moving me and my sisters in ASAP


Update: even though we should be in our own houses due to the current pandemic, our parents came home to find me, and my five uncles moving all of our stuff out.
That's when I dropped the bomb that I will be moving out and taking my siblings with me.

Not going to bore you with the details of two grown people having an adult tantrum but there was a lot of crying and screaming and fake cries of betrayal.

I told them that I and my older sister have a right to move out since we are over 18 and it's taking me a long time but I finally realized the manipulation that they are putting me through and how they're basically using me as a cash cow, I also pointed out the years of abuse towards me and my siblings and said that I will be taking my younger sister with us and if they try anything, we have a crap ton of proof against them.

They kept arguing and screaming but eventually my room was completely gutted out, and my sisters shared room was gutted out as well since I bought everything for them and my parents have not bought them a single thing.

To say that they were broken was an understatement, it's as if their whole world crashed in the matter of a couple hours, they just sat on the couch depressed and realizing that 60% of the rent is not going to be paid by me anymore and if they don't have three kids to treat as slave anymore.

Just for the sake of being petty I decided to take everything else in the house that I had paid for it, I'm going to keep it in my aunt garage as she already has furniture but I just wanted to say a final F you to parents.

I'm honestly just surprised how much my life has changed in the past 24 hours and how making a post on this thread has changed so much for me, we're still in the process of moving some final things and I'll be sure to give you guys a bigger update later on.

Also, to those calling me a spineless ""faget"" in the DM's for paying as much as I do and letting my parents boss me around, thank you, your words mean so much to me. Also its ""faggot"" if you're going to insult me by using a homophobic slur, at least spell it right",True,1586307256.0,2020-04-06 06:57:55

Besides being morning-grumpy, I've heard stories from female friends of mine of getting approached with Ni Hao or Konichiwa just because they were Asian, the majority of which were crude pick-up lines. And personally I take poorly to the assumption of someone's ethnicity and culture when in the US; English should be the only one assumed IMO. So in that moment I not-so-politely responded in German ""Ich spreche kein Chinesisch. Sprichst du Deutsch, da du weiß aussiehst?"" (I don't speak Chinese. Do you speak German, because you look white?) I'm assuming he didn't understand any of that, but he muttered ""sorry"" and I turned back around and ordered my drink - in English.

"AITA for telling her to ""Know her place""?",13441,Not the A-hole,1710,d4k3ql,1568581047.0,"Throwaway account cause several friends know my main account.

&#x200B;

I (F27) have been friends with a guy; Steve since I was 12. There is a group of us - and key point is that I am the only girl. I don't really know 'why' I'm the girl of the group; but I am. Outside of my recent ex; Tom, of 3 years, I have never once liked or been liked by any of these guys. I am not a ""pretty"" girl, and I describe my taste in clothes as 'meh'. I'm not fashion savvy or makeup savvy, etc. Let me say this again - Steve and I have never touched beyond hugging. The most intimate we've gotten was probably him carrying me home when I broke my foot once.

&#x200B;

About 4 months ago, Tom and I broke up, and at the same time Steve began dating this girl Abby. Abby is beautiful and knows all the things that I wish I knew about being a woman. So, upon meeting her, I was warm, friendly and was even asking for fashion advice when I met her. I wanted to be her friend. Abby was quiet, and not as warm, but I put that down to shyness.

&#x200B;

Last night Steve, Abby, Tom, myself and a few others went out for dinner and drinks. I continued being friendly to Abby, while not really having a response to that. I went to the bathroom and when I came out of the stall Abby was standing there waiting for me.

&#x200B;

I'll cut a giant argument short, but Abby accused me of breaking up with Tom to get with Steve and told me that she will do whatever she has to do to get rid of me, stating that it was ""super weird"" that I was the only girl friends with a group of guys, insinuating that I'd slept with all of them, but then also implying that I should have left the group when Tom and I broke up. My response to this was to tell Abby to 'know' her place and that I had been around for much longer than her, and that if anyone was going to be ""gotten rid of"" it'd be her because we had been through the jealous girlfriend situation before and Steve had chosen me, and would never seriously consider a girl that hated his best friend.

&#x200B;

Abby went out and told Steve I attacked her - who didn't believe a word and broke up with her on the spot. Since then, I've gotten messages from Abby's friends on social media to tell me what a whore, bitch, slut, I am and that Steve and I were fucking the whole time. One girl even sent these messages to my family to 'warn' me about what kind of 'slut' I am. My own brother says he feels that I've caused this drama myself by

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Extra info as required:

Holy shit - didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. And I did not expect gold at all - so thanks? 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately I did mean 27 in the post - I failed to mention that Abby is actually 22; but I do highly accept that I could have handled the situation much better; I am NOT a confrontational person. I grew up in an abusive home (in particular from my step-mother and step-sister) and my general response to conflict is tears (which I hate) or just bolting and ghosting a situation. I think being ambushed is why I lost my cool. 

&#x200B;

I read a lot of comments about how this came off as ""not like other girls"". I don't know how to not make it do so. I'm simply not ""good"" at being friends with other girls. I'm shy, awkward, I stumble over my words; and because I \*want\* to be friends with them, it comes off as desperate and overdone. I do have girl acquaintances but it never goes beyond the occasional coffee time. 

&#x200B;

Boundaries - I'm not a touchy-feely person outside of if I'm actually in a relationship or seeking a relationship with someone. Again - childhood abuse. Once we got out of high school and stopped seeing each other as frequently - we do a quick side hug goodbye. 3 of the other guys have girlfriends who all seem to enjoy my company when we are together. 

&#x200B;

Somebody mentioned that I'm obviously into my friends if I got with Tom. Tom and I kissed as a joke once, sensed the chemistry and things went from there. We all thought it was going to be forever - but Tom got some bad health news and put ""us"" on hold until/unless it ends positively. He doesn't want to put me through that. 

&#x200B;

The long version of the argument began with Abby asking why I was wearing such an inappropriate outfit for someone who'd just broken up with someone (jeans, boots and a shirt); I stared at her in shock and said ""what the fuck - what's going on?"" and then she straight away started with the accusations. 

&#x200B;

As a last note - the previous girlfriend of Steve's happened when we were about 16; and when that happened, I stepped back completely and began distancing myself from everyone. It was about 2 weeks before Tom of all people got it out of me and he went to Steve and told him. I offered to leave the friendship and not make their lives a burden or whatever the words I said were, and they all said ""No, she's in the wrong"" and that any girlfriend who couldn't/wouldn't understand I was a friend/sister was not the girl they wanted to spend time with. This was repeated to me this morning when I showed the messages I was getting from Abby and her friends. I was apologising profusely (and for my part in the argument - telling her to 'know her place' which was such bad wording on my part - I know) and was told by Steve ""well she obviously wasn't wife material then"". being friends with these guys for so long and that I should have stuck with girls instead, or ended the friendships once we all started dating in high school. He also feels that I'm leading on any man I'm with by having male friends who they then have to question constantly if I have or am sleeping with. So - AITA?",False,1568596579.0,2019-09-15 13:57:27
AITA for refusing to adopt my wife’s two kids after discovering who the real father is?,13432,Not the A-hole,1807,cn6iya,1565217063.0,"I am a 35 years old guy, and I was lucky enough to marry my crush (27F) two years ago. We met at work, where she was a receptionist for the big building my company is in. Anyways, she has two daughters, 6 and 7 years old.

When I married my wife, I was a bit iffy at the idea of being a dad so fast and so suddenly to two kids that aren’t mine, but I love my wife so much I am willing to sacrifice my man-time and a portion of my salary to take care of the kids.

To be honest, I’ve had my ups and downs with them (you know, kids) and sometimes I think I’d be happier going back to my “lone wolf” life. But I fully know that this is my life now and I try my best to suck it up and do what I signed up for.

Back to the story: I know the kids dad had died only from my wife’s words and I’ve never had reason to doubt that.

It has been two or three months since she started convincing me that I should adopt them as a birthday gift for both of them (their birthday happens in two consecutive days, coincidence). I’d be fine with that, it’s just paper for what I would do anyways.

I agreed to that and she said she’d get on with the documents. Well fantastic! I thought. I like not having to do anything. What really got me suspicious is how she changed her behaviour with her phone and laptop. She started putting the phone face down, and she created a totally different user for her laptop she switches to when she’s with me.

I thought she was cheating so I did what every scumbag like me would do, I spied on her. Long story short, I come to know by a very reliable source that…. her ex-husband isn’t paying alimony anymore as he is in jail with no money to his account. The world crushed on me. First I thought the guy was dead, now I discover he is alive, paying alimony to my wife’s bank account while I was financially providing too.

I confronted my wife and she didn’t deny any of it. She started crying and she was adamant that she did that only for the kids’ well being. She was putting the alimony money he ex was giving her into an account for when the kids will be 18 yo (I have no proof of that). She also said that it was a while since she felt I should adopt them, as they love me and they look up to me. She was firm about stating that nothing happened with her ex husband while she was with me. She said that her ex is ""dead"" for her by all means. She admitted that she lied, but for good purposes - as she was scared that a guy like me would be scared by her reckless past. That's not who she is anymore, as she is focused on family and on us.

Now, I need to find out more about her ex-husband that’s for sure. I am also furious with my wife for not trusting me enough to come clean about her past. Meanwhile, will I be an asshole if I refuse to adopt the kids (they have a dad and he’s ALIVE!) and if I state that I will retract from them all the financial support in case I decide to get a divorce?

AITA for not tipping the pizza place on an order for 35 pizzas?,13416,Everyone Sucks,5323,dltcu8,1571829395.0,"Not my story, but my brother's, and I'm really unsure where I stand on it.

My little brother, is doing an internship with a large corporation. He organized an internal food drive, in which the floor that donates the most wins free pizza for lunch on a Friday. 

At the conclusion of the food drive, my brother called the pizza place on a Monday and asked about the logistics of ordering 35 pizzas, on a Friday, during lunch hour. They said it wouldn't be a problem, and to place the order Wednesday morning. 

He calls back Wednesday, and speaks with the same manager. The manager tells him they can no longer do the order, as it's too big of an order to do during their Friday lunch rush. He recommends my brother try the middle of the following week, and they agree on the following Tuesday.

Monday rolls around and my brother places the order, and uses the corporate credit card to pay over the phone. The manager then tells him they cannot have 35 pizzas ready at 12:30, but can have 18 ready at noon, and another 17 ready at 12:45. My brother tells him that would work. When asked what to put on the line for a tip amount, my brother responds $0.

Noon on Tuesday, my brother shows up at the pizza place, picks up the first 18 pizzas, and delivers them to the winning office floor lunch room. Then, he returns to the store to pick up the remaining 17 pizzas. 

While waiting for the second round of pizzas at the store, the following exchange occurs:

Manager: ""Are you going to leave a tip?""

Brother: ""No.""

Manager: ""Usually with large orders like this you are required to leave a tip""

Brother: ""You aren't delivering or serving these pizzas. When we talked on the phone yesterday you did not mention a mandatory tip"".

Manager: ""It's corporate policy that orders this large require a 15% gratuity"". 

Brother: ""That isn't what we agreed to on the phone yesterday. I'm not leaving a tip"".

Manager: ""Well then you aren't getting the rest of your pizzas"". 

At this point, my brother and the manager begin arguing, escalating to the point of my brother's coworker pulling him to the side and recommending a small tip (5%). My brother relents. He tells the manager he will leave a tip, but he wants to choose the amount. He hands the manager his card, who runs it and hands him back a new receipt for the order, with a 15% gratuity assessed ($125 instead of $40).

My brother then gets into a yelling match with the manager, and is escorted out of the restaurant by his coworker.

AITA for 'gate crashing' my ex's wedding and causing the marriage to get annulled?,13406,Everyone Sucks,1871,gffwaw,1588916544.0,"I recently posted this on r/tifu and they made me wonder if I'm TA

My ex's wedding was in February. And like you could guess, I wasn't personally invited nor was I told anything about it from him even though we spoke daily. Well I found out about it from his grandmother (we're close) and she suggested I 'gate crash' and that she would cover for me (think she doesn't like the bride). I was interested in going because I wanted to find some closure since we had broken up rather quickly a few months before and I still wasn't over him. So I said yes. 

The day came and his grandmother 'snuck' me in and we watched the ceremony. It was beautiful. I shed a few tears but it really solidified things. I was ready to leave afterwards but his grandmother pushed me to go to the reception as well and sit next to her at the family table. Pretty awkward but I went. I was still mingling with the family, standing up, when the bride and groom came. They came and greeted and she congratulated me on the pregnancy. I thanked her and said something about how I couldn't wait to co parent with the two of them. Turns out that she didn't know that I was pregnant (5 months at the time) with his child the whole time. She lost her shit and ran out. He tried to run after her but then her dad came and started a scene. Lucky for me, my ex's brother came and helped get me out of there as soon as possible. 

My ex still asks for updates but I recently heard from his grandmother they broke up and got an annulment. The 'bride' weirdly still follows me and comments/likes my pictures so I think she's fine with me but still, AITA?

My daughter was in the 5th grade at a regular public elementary school. Now there is this other little girl In her grade that is just a known bully among the girls. My daughter is very sweet, and quiet she had never been in trouble before. Now I think her kind nature has the tendency to make her a target for a bully. This girl had been picking on my daughter for years on and off, as well as lots of the girls. I tried so many times contacting her teachers, principal, her mom, school counselors. Everytime it just fell on deaf ears. I know I wasn’t the only parent who tried and tried. There were multiple family’s who were fed up. 

Well last year it was about two weeks before school was out my daughter and her bestfriend were playing outside. This girl starts picking on my daughter and her friend. My daughter looks her in the face and says “your a bitch I’m sick of you teasing us please __ leave us alone” Well this girl goes and tells the teacher 

 Now look I would had preferred my child didn’t use that type of language, and we did talk about how she could had been polite but firm In her words. At the same time if the school would had done something a long time ago none of this would had happened. Well my child’s teacher began to scream at my child until she was in tears, and then sent her to the office where she was screamed at for HOURS, longer. So now she’s being bullied by staff as well. 

I was livid and went into the teachers office and let her have it. I told her “if you people would had done something about the bullying my child wouldn’t had felt the need to bully this child back. How dare you make my child out to be a monster and bad child when she has been victimized since the first grade by this girl”

The teacher said I should be “deeply ashamed of my daughter” hell no. I told her to “fuck off” and pulled her from the school we will be attending a private school in the fall.",False,False,2020-06-11 18:47:05
AITA for refusing to help my father after he refused to help me years ago?,13369,Not the A-hole,1440,evimar,1580305365.0,"My father was never present in my life even after various attempts I made to have a real relationship with him. The little time I spent with him as child he was very abusive (it took me longer than most to lose my baby fat and he'd always make snark comments about it; he'd also compare me to evey other child he knew and I'd always not be as good as them). 

When I was ten my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. Things got really tough, we had to move in with my grandma who became responsible for the both of us. Money was always tight (mental ilness treatment is very expeny in my country). My grandma tried to contact my father to ask for  help with me because it was really tough for me to see my mother in the state she was in. He always said he couldn't take me in or help with extra money because he had a new family that need his attention. After a while he moved to the other side of the country and didn't talk to me for years. 

Eventually things got better, the meds started to work and now you couldn't even tell my mother has any kind of mental ilness. However, money was still short for us, especially after my mom got pregnant again even after the doctors said that was impossible (abortion is not a option in my country). 

After I finished HS I had no hopes of ever going to college because we couldn't afford, but my mom still made me take my country's equivalent of the SAT. Somehow I got a 50% scholarship for one of the best schools in the country. The problema was, even with the scholarship, we still couldn't afford and I couldn't work to pay for it because the school was in the next town and I'd spend literally every time off in traffic (we also don't have college dorms here).

At this point my dad was back in town, so I decided to give it a try and contacted him to see if he could help. He wasn't rich, but he had money and was alwaysdoings stuff with his family so I figured he would have at least a little to help me. 

But all he said was: ""can't help you,,you know that. Just find a job"". And after that he never tried to contact me again.

Right after that my mom received a very high restitution form the state and literally gave it all to me. I went to college, graduated, got a amazing job and now I paying for my sister's college.

Last month my mom made a FB post saying how much she was grateful to have me as her daughter because I was helping with my sister education and then out of the blue my dad decided to contact me and ask for me to help with his other daughter college too. I said I couldn't because I was already paying for my sister's and I was saving to buy a apartment. I also said that maybe she should get a job. I felt really great, but then them he started to say I was being a vindictive a-hole. He made a FB post about it and now a lot of people are agreeing with him to the point where I'm reconsidering it.

EDIT: 

Wow, this really blew up. I decided to make this edit because it would take me forever to respond every individual message. 

First, I want to thank you for how nice all were. Also, really thank you for whoever sent the wards, you didn't need, this is just a troaway account. 

Second, I decided I wont be making a FB post to respond to him. A lot of you said I should post my side of the sorry, but tbh I don't think people will care. The ones that are on his side knows he was never present and knows my mom was sick, they just think I should help because we're ""family"" and nothing will really change their mind. 

Thirdly, I decided to help his kids. I know I have no obligation to them, I know that maybe he's lying about his money problems, but it's just hard for me to see a person I'm technically related to in a situation I struggled so much with. But I won't be given them money per say. A very good friend of mine works teaching for a college in my city, it's far from the best school, but they offer a lot of scholarships and they are cheaper than most. He said he could get up to 25%. As I said, it's really not the best school, but it's still better than nothing if you're in need. They could try getting a loan for the other 75% or something.",False,1580315403.0,2020-01-29 05:42:45
UPDATE: AITA for not wanting to participate in my niece’s wedding after she excluded my daughter?,13356,UPDATE,1179,cwpxf5,1567050993.0,"Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c7jfwy/aita_for_not_wanting_to_participate_in_my_nieces/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app

Hey everyone! This is the daughter writing the update. My mom didn’t know how to do an update post and asked me to write it for her. We’re both here to respond to comments if you have any.

I saw that a few people asked what my aunt’s opinion was after the verdict was given on this post! Here is the answer to that question: My aunt said that she had told my cousin from the beginning that excluding me was going to hurt my feelings and suggested to her that I be a bridesmaid instead of my mother. My cousin turned down this suggestion but would not say why. 

I also saw some people wondering if something had gone down between my cousin and me that I wasn’t telling my mom. This is definitely valid question! The answer is no, she and I haven’t had any problems prior to this (that I know of, at least). She has always been like a sister to me. If she ever had a problem with me or anything I’ve done I would hope she would tell me.

Another question I saw was about my relationship with my father. He and I have a very tense relationship due largely to some mental heath problems that he has. Prior to all of this I had confided in my cousin a lot about this. This made her decision to include him over me hurtful in a very poignant way.

After reading all of your comments and some more deliberation, my mom ended up staying in the wedding party. I appreciate her desire to stand up for me but I really did want my cousin’s wedding to go smoothly (despite my feelings being very hurt). My mom respected my wishes. She is an amazing mom all around and I am lucky to have her in my corner. 

After the conversation I had with my cousin (described in the last post) I was on the fence about attending the wedding. I then heard from other relatives that she was concerned that I would “sabotage the wedding” if I were to attend. I found this comment to be bizarre and confusing. At this point I decided that it would be best to remove myself from the situation entirely. I told her that I wouldn’t be attending and left it at that. It was a hard decision to make, but your reactions to the original post made me feel more confident in my choice.

The wedding did end up going smoothly. I heard from multiple sources that there was plenty of extra room in the bridal suite. I wish I could have been there with my family to support her on her big day. She and I have both been part of each other’s major life milestones for as long as I can remember. I still haven’t figured out why I was the only one excluded but I have come to the conclusion that she and I must not be as close as I had always thought we were. At this point I’m not sure that I want to be. Your feedback on the original post played a large part in me realizing that.

Thanks to everyone for reading and for all of your responses! We got great insight from everyone who commented (especially those with different perspectives from our own). If you guys have any more questions feel free to comment!",False,False,2019-08-28 20:56:33
AITA for publicly revealing who my biological parents are on Facebook and kind of messing things up for them?,13317,Asshole,2867,g9nhjo,1588110444.0,"I was given up for adoption when I was a baby by my parents who were 19 years old.

Due to reasons, I was taken from my adoptive parents and put in foster care when I was 11 and remained in the system until I went to college.

When I turned 18, I was given my mother's contact information by someone. I found out she was married to my biological father. They had public profiles on Facebook and Instagram. I ended up messaging my mother who never responded. 

I then tried to message my father who basically replied saying that he's sorry but they would rather not have me in their lives. That it took them a while to grieve over giving me up and that they don't want to go through all that pain again.

Well at this point I got pretty pissed because I think it's kind of shitty they think they can prevent me from knowing the rest of my family.

I ended up messaging my grandmother (my mother's mom) who was actually happy to know me. I met her in person and we really bonded.

I also have two younger siblings but I didn't contact them after what my father said.

Well four months ago, I saw my father post of a picture of them at some Church event and say ""my beautiful wife and our two amazing kids"".

This was on their church Facebook page. This was probably wrong but I replied with a comment saying ""Don't you mean three kids?""

I didn't really expect the amount of people responding to that as I did. There were a bunch of people my parents knew that started asking questions. I freaked out and deleted my comment.

Then I started getting dms from people, including people I was related to. Later that day, my grandmother made a post confirming I was a child given up for adoption.

So now, I started making connections with some extended family and have been to a few family parties. My parents have been told they aren't invited unless they accept me which they haven't.

The whole drama has kind of messed with their lives and business. My parents are now apparently separated. I don't really accept that as my fault.

AITA for telling a boomer couple to move out of their house?,13252,Everyone Sucks,3053,eoq0fz,1579058766.0,"My wife and I bought a house a couple of years ago. It's decent-sized yard and we even have a couple of chickens (this is Los Angeles). We have three boys - 6yo twins and a 9yo. They are kids. They are loud. Not screaming loud. They love playing in the yard and playing at the park literally across the street. My next door neighbors complain all the time about the noise level in the yard and at the park. They are this boomer retired couple with kids my age (mid-30's). Actually most of the neighborhood is like that because so few people especially with kids can afford a house in that area so it's a bunch of retired boomer snitches with Ring and security cameras at their front porch (no, NOTHING ever happens here) and they designated my neighbor as the block cop. The funny thing is that the kids are hardly home. They're in school most of the day and have sporting practices/games on the weekend.

I tried to reason with them, but they feel that because they lived in their house for 40 years that we have to follow their rules as their next door neighbors and keep quiet. I have no sympathy for them. These are the people who bought their sizable home for $40,000 in the 80s and if adjusted for inflation, it's like buying the same house for $125K. But it's a house in LA so it's more like a million. My wife and I make good money, but our mortgage is astronomical. We are working much harder than our neighbors ever did.

Yesterday, our neighbor came to our door and asked complained, again, about our kids being loud. Not too loud. Just loud. At the park. Per the other neighbors who lived across the street from said park. Then he lectured me about my ""logic"" of moving to a quiet area with loud kids. If that wasn't bad enough, he suggested that my wife and I look at homes by the ocean because ""you don't have neighbors to the west of you."" Houses by the ocean are like millions of dollars lol. I asked him how I would do that and he said that wasn't his problem. So I told him that he should move out of their house and move to the ocean where he won't have neighbors.

[UPDATE] AITA for not wanting my fiancee to dance to a love song dedicated to her late fiance at our wedding?,13239,Update,302,c9un3j,1562454804.0,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aoadwq/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fiancee_to_dance_to_a/

Two months ago, I married the love of my life. I was thinking about this thread the other day, how it went, and where my head was at when I made it, and I thought you guys might like an update.

A little anticlimactically, the thing I was stressing about was a bit of a miscommunication, which probably happens a lot here. Kayla wanted to dance with her late fiance's (I'll go ahead and just call him Luke from now on) father at our wedding, and Vanilla Twilight was an example of a song along the lines of what she wanted, not the set-in-stone top choice like I had thought. I (and a lot of commenters in the original thread) spent a lot of time over-analyzing the lyrics to that song looking for hidden meaning in every word, while it turns out she hadn't put much more thought into the suggestion than ""This is a kind of sad song that I like.""

We got together that night and she had made several playlists of possible first dance songs for us, songs for when she walks down the aisle, music to play at the reception, and song choices for her dance with Luke's father. We spent hours listening to them all and talking about the wedding. We even made a tournament-style bracket for our first dance song in her journal and put songs head to head against each other until the victor emerged. And at the end, we talked about the wedding and our relationship, Luke and their relationship, and grief, what it was like when she lost him and what it was like for me when I lost my mom at a young age, what a family is, and all the things we're hopeful for for the future. We stayed up until three in the morning just talking and planning and laughing and crying a little, and I'm so glad for it. After getting bombarded by dozens of different opinions from dozens of different people earlier that day, I had been worried that I was going to have a conflict with my fiancee shortly before our wedding. But there was no conflict, just a pure memory.

After that night, I starting putting in more effort to be involved with the wedding planning process and actually ask for the things I wanted, which Kayla actually really appreciated. We also took a long weekend a couple of weeks before the wedding to go on a camping trip together for just the two of us, which I highly recommend to anyone who is getting married. Overall, there was a complete flip in my feelings leading up to the wedding from being somewhat insecure and excited but nervous to being completely at ease, excited, and feeling stronger about my relationship than ever.

The wedding day itself was really wonderful and worth the wait. Kayla and Luke's father had their dance to Lean On Me, and I also had a dance with Kayla's mom and it was very emotional in a good way. I really felt that the day was a celebration of our love, and I was genuinely happy that Luke's parents were there to celebrate along with us because they are very much members of our family and I wish I had the space to describe all the ways they've been there for us through the years.

My amazing wife is who she is because of all the experiences that she has had in her life, and I don't want to be the kind of man who asks her to pretend that she has never loved before me or pretend that her grief is something that is or should be done with forever now that she has me. I just want to say how glad I am that we shared that night together and that the wedding was nothing but love and celebration. I never thought I could be so happy.",False,False,2019-07-06 16:13:24

AITA for repurposing the wedding fund and refusing to compromise?,13230,Everyone Sucks,946,dbclh8,1569883529.0,"I have 2 kids, different dads. I have a savings account for both. The account of my oldest, Lucy, has had £10 per week added to it by both myself and her father, and has gone up by about a grand a year and is over £13,000. The second account is for my son, Luke, who is 6. I have regularly added to this account since I found out I was pregnant, and have about 3.5k in the account.

His father, my fiance, had a separate account for Luke and has told me he was doing the £10 a week since we started the accounts. I recently found out the account he has for Luke only has a couple hundred in it. My fiance earns less than me but more than my Ex. If my Ex can afford £10 a week routinely, when he has nearly identical spending habits to me and my fiance but lives alone and therefore pays for rent/bills in full, and my fiance earns more than my Ex, there is no reason my fiance should not have been able to make the £10 payments each week (I earn the most of all 3 of us, followed by my fiance, followed by Ex). My fiance said he ""forgot"" and asked me to redistribute the contents of Lucy's fund to make up for the money missing from Luke's. I said fuck no.

Luke's account is around 3k less than it should be. We have a wedding fund that contains a little over 2k of mine and my fiance's combined money. We don't want a huge wedding but we do want a really nice honeymoon where we can just go away for a week and not worry about money while we're there or returning.

My fiance says that he doesn't have the money to replace the 3k Luke is missing all at once. I have said that I want to take the wedding fund as it currently stands and deposit the lot into the savings account I control that is meant for Luke. I would not be doing this if my fiance had not 1) lied for around 7 years about saving for our son, 2) claimed he did not have the money to replace it, 3) suggested I take money from my daughter, saved up with help from my Ex, to fix my fiance's mistake. I also said that I want him to set up a direct deposit of £10 to the account that only I control each week. I will not budge on any of this as we agreed years ago now that this was a good idea and that it was important to invest in our son's future, and he has lied to me for 7 years now about making that investment.

AITA?

&#x200B;

For people asking why this is so urgent to me: It's not the end of the world if the full amount isn't in Luke's account any time soon, as the plan was always to give each kid the total in the account when they were 18/moving out, but my fiance says he can't afford to repay the money in bulk or multiple installments and if he keeps on not paying, then when Lucy is 18 she'll have 19-20 grand, and when Luke is 18 he'll get closer to 10k from just me. While I don't doubt he'd be grateful for whatever he gets, he'd get half of what Lucy will if my fiance doesn't make up the difference.

&#x200B;

Update:

I asked him again why he didn't have the money. He said he just didn't. I asked him to bring up his bank statement, or payslip, or anything that shows how much money he has (bearing in mind he was last paid on the 28th and today is the 30th). He refused. I told him that if we were combining finances in any way I should be able to see where his money is going. He responded that I wasn't showing him my financial information, so I pulled up my banking app so he could see my own balance and transaction history. He then showed me his last statement, which his bank emailed him today. We had a fight and he's staying in a hotel tonight, which it turns out he can more than afford. He has nearly 60k in his personal current account and savings accounts, presumably meant solely for himself.

I cannot see us getting married after this. Not ever. It's not just the trust issue, but also that he, knowing he had nearly 60k in savings, decided that it was okay to try and guilt trip me into taking money meant for my daughter to fix it for him.",True,1569873565.0,2019-09-30 15:45:29

We invite her over for camping trips, fishing trips and stuff because she’s in our friend group, we don’t really care that she is a female, you know?

He was my 3rd boyfriend (I'm 26 F) and the only guy I have ever had sex with. Basically I grew up in a very repressive culture and family where premarital sex was big taboo especially for girls. It took me a long time to get over that.


He knows all this. We were friends for 2 years and then dated for 6 months before we had sex and I told him about all my issues. He was the first guy I trusted enough to sleep with him. 


We were using condoms and bc pills and I really don't know what happened. I already felt so guilty because I felt I must have screwed up somehow. We had already discussed previously how neither of us wanted kids right now.


I went to talk to him before booking an abortion and the first thing he said was he wants a paternity test because 2 bc methods shouldn't have failed. I was so hurt that he could trust me so little after all the trust I put in him and that he thought I was the kind of person to cheat. Also I kind of started to believe what my mom always said that all guys think that girls who have premarital sex are just easy sluts. 


So I told him since he didn't think it was his kid that meant his opinion on how to go forward was irrelevant.

We are both into knitting and wine, and we are both really chill.

Ideal friendship, right? Well, she has a 15 y/o son (Braden), who is really unclean. He stinks like rotting meat and BO, and he also has this awful metallic odor that makes me gag.

The next day at work, Chloe asked if I wanted to come over for dinner, and I had to tell her no. She really pushed me for a reason, and I told her her son smells like ass and I basically can’t be around him until he works on his cleanliness.

Several months ago, we were all having dinner as a family. I was asked by my sister if I could be the organist for her wedding. She told me that she can't pay me, but that I can have food at the buffet. Since most of the gigs that I do are paying ones, I initially said that she's going to have to pay me. But my parents got mad at me and told me that it's unreasonable to expect family to pay me for playing music. I asked my sister if there'll be vegan options for her buffet, and she told me that she'll make sure that there will be. So I gave in and agreed to play as long as she has vegan options for me.

When I arrived on the day of the wedding, my sister came over and told me that she wasn't able to get any vegan options for the buffet, so she got an Impossible Whopper for me from Burger King on her way there. Not only was that completely insulting, it has mayo in it so it isn't even vegan. I told her that I'm not going to play for the wedding unless she sends me $200 on Venmo right now.

There was no music for the wedding ceremony. I went to go see a movie with my friends instead.

When I got home, my parents were predictably very angry and screaming at me. But I refused to apologize. I honestly don't care that much what they think anymore at this point because I'm already moving out in less than a month. My sister is now demanding that I reimburse her $2500 for the organ rental, and is threatening to take me to small claims court.

AITA for saying I prefer to dress modestly?,13164,No A-holes here,1232,fdjksl,1583384084.0,"I am a woman 35F and I work in a very male dominated industry. I am not a tomboy or ""one of the guys"", I have ""feminine"" hobbies and interests like knitting, baking etc but I also like some ""masculine"" hobbies as well- I do MMA, I dabble in blacksmithing. 

Anyway, I dress pretty modestly at work. There's no particular reason for it but I usually wear a button down shirt, slacks/trousers and a cardigan- like this even with bright colours

Even in summer, I wear this but with a lighter material shirt and a lighter cardigan. 

About a year ago, another woman joined our firm and she's more Sex in the City type fashion, very chic, feminine and put together but that means she often wears see through blouses (with a singlet underneath), lower cut tops and skirts of varying lengths.

I was doing some online shopping during my lunch break the other day in the kitchen area when she saw and sat down next to me to chat. 

She kept telling me to get tops and skirts that are not in my comfort zone and she kept asking why when I said ""it's not me"".

Finally I had to say, I like to dress modestly. 

I have no idea how I could word that better but I felt backed into a corner. She got offended and I said that I had no issue with what she wore but I preferred to be more covered up because it made me comfortable. 

She's now extremely cold and told me I was ""shaming"" women in this industry who didn't want to lose their femininity in a male dominated field.

I get that but I'm not super girly anyway, I dress for my comfort.

AITA for complaining about a car salesman unprofessionalism?,13166,Not the A-hole,841,gvwffz,1591228250.0,"I (28 FTM) feel like a fucking Karen. Okay, so I fucking hate my Nissan rogue. The transmission died at only 70k miles. Thankfully it was covered by warranty, so I took it to a Nissan dealership to get the transmission replaced. They had it for a week. The day I dropped it off, I asked to talk to a seller to look into trading it in and getting a better car. I was paired with a pretty young guy, around my age (I'm 28). He did well showing me the cars, and then we went to his office to talk numbers. 

At mo point during this did I curse, or act unprofessional. I'm making a purchase, not a friend. So when we sat down and he started talking about it's good that I'm getting a new car, because mine is fucked up. I was a little shocked that he would speak that way, but whatever. I curse a lot normally, I'm a veteran, I'm not a prude. But then he started escalating. Talking about this new car was big enough to get fucked in, and it would make me look more professional and mature. At that I go ""excuse me? What are you implying?"" And he was like well you're in shorts and a t shirt, you look like a teenager. Ans then he asked how I had my paycheck, and before I could answer (disabled veteran) he said that I probably still lived at home with my parents. And I was like actually, I own a farm about 45 minutes away, and I bought it when I was 26. And he suddenly bristles and goes ""well my girlfriend owns a bigger home"". Um??? I didnt say my house size, and wtf why does that even matter?

At this point I was severely uncomfortable and said can we just go back to the car purchase, you're not my friend and I don't appreciate you trying to act like it. And he went back to the numbers, with occasional comments thrown in about how horrible my car was and I probably wouldnt even get 5k trading it in. And I'm like, aren't you supposed to say Nissans are great? And he waved it off. 

So I ended the appointment, came up with an excuse to leave. The next day I came in and asked to speak to the manager, and told them everything. They were horrified and said he was new, and he would be talked to. 

When I returned the next week, I found out he had been fired. 


I feel like an ass, but I made it super clear how uncomfortable I was and he just kept pushing. He had the fellowkids vibe, like he was trying to rib me and curse and use slang to seem relatable to someone my age, which was fucking weird because he was my age! 

So, AITA? 

Also, because I had to give my legal name, he knew I was transgender. He still addressed me as male, thankfully. I'm passing, so he didnt know until we were midway through paperwork that I'm not a cis man.

AITA for correcting my cousin publically over her claiming no one in the family had ever been to university before her child?,13153,Not the A-hole,868,cjpipi,1564509201.0,"The title probably gives 90% of the information, but I'll provide a bit more context.

I, along with my brother, just graduated from university. My first cousin once removed (aged 18) is just about to start university after the summer. My cousin, the child's mother, just posted a long, congratulatory post on Facebook (she just had her offer bumped up to an unconditional place). In this post, she went on and on about how Child will be the first in the whole wider family to go to university. She listed off how her and her husband's parents, aunts and uncles (including my dad, the cousin's uncle) and all their kids haven't been able to attend university, and how her child will start a new generation of university attendees.

I don't know whether she was playing dumb or had just had a brain fart, but she knows that both myself and my brother just graduated from university. I would have given her the benefit of the doubt for just meaning the 'adults' in the family hadn't been into further study (my dad was born 10 years after his next youngest siblings, which is why I have cousins 20ish years older than me, and a 17 year old first cousin once removed), but since she name-checked and tagged us in with everyone else, it felt like it was deliberate.

I replied congratulating my second cousin, phrasing a second part of the comment as 'So great to see another [surname] starting their next stage in life, just after [brother] and I graduate from our universities!', to politely remind her that her bold claims were false. A little while later I got a message from my aunt, my cousin's mother, asking me to remove the comment since Cousin was embarrassed and felt like I was trying to one-up her (even though that's exactly what the tone of her post was).

I haven't yet removed the comment, but woke up feeling pretty asshole-ish, and probably will remove the comment later on. Just how much am I in the wrong?

EDIT: Thanks for the advice everyone, we've had to pander to my cousin before over things, so I need to learn to stand up for myself. Also I know I messed up in correctly labelling who everyone is, the person going to university soon is my first cousin once removed, and her mum is my cousin. I also got a pronoun wrong at some point too, MY brother and I were the people who graduated a few weeks ago. Finally, to everyone saying my profile picture should be me in my gown, it already was!!

2nd EDIT: I know I got the proper name for my first cousin once removed wrong!! I didn't want to change it in the post since I've seen so many times about how changing posts automatically means you're a liar and karma-seeker, but every PM saying 'just so you know...' is slowly breaking my soul!

He is Australian, I am Italian. I've been living in Australia for the last 1.5 years. I am here on a partner visa.

I am currently 3 months pregnant and I thought we were both happy. However, I only just found out that he's been having an affair with a coworker for the last 6 months. At first he denied it but I had proof so he changed to begging me for forgiveness and that we could work it out and all this bullshit. But I don't want to. I'm done. I don't want to be with a cheater. I broke up with him and already moved into an Airbnb. I'm planning on going back to Italy because I have nothing here apart from my pos ex. I let him know today. He flipped out and told me I can't do that. He said I'd be kidnapping our child and that I'm not allowed to leave. But I've made up my mind. I already talked to my parents and I can live with them until I have figured everything out. I'll likely get my old high paying job back so I'm not worried. 

However, all of my ex's friends have been texting and calling me all day saying I'm a pos for stealing his baby and that they will take legal action. I don't think they can and I wouldn't be allowed to stay anyway since I'm on a partner visa and this partnership doesn't exist anymore. 

AITA for going home?


Update:

Unfortunately the mods wouldn't let me post an update post but I'm hoping that some of you still find this if you are interested.

Many of you wanted an update so here it goes. 

I left Australia the day after my first post and I'm in Italy now. I'm staying with my family. Thanks to the good connections my friends have I got a good job at the very company I worked for before I moved to Japan. 

At first I thought I'd keep the baby but after a lot of thinking I decided I would abort it. It had to happen rather quickly as I was running out of time so I had the abortion today in Switzerland. I'm doing okay. This morning I sent a text to my ex letting him know about the procedure and when I checked my phone after it was done it was full of missed calls, texts dripping with abuse and threats that he would come to Italy to stop me. So yeah I made the right decision. Nothing ties me to this man anymore. I feel weirdly free but numb at the same time. But I'm determined to start over. 

Lastly, I would like to thank everyone who sent me encouraging messages or even offered their help. I do really appreciate this so much. I hope you understand that I didn't message you back but I was so busy getting out. I will forever remember the internet strangers who were willing to help me out.

For the last 2 years I had waist long hair. It looked pretty but it was soooo much work. My boyfriend was very vocal about his love for my hair.

So last Friday I was booked in for a hair cut. I planned on cutting off maybe 5 to 10 cm. My boyfriend was happy with that. But then my hair dresser asked if I had ever considered cutting it collar bone length as she thought it would look very cute on me. I hadn’t but the moment she said it I knew I was ready for a change and told her to have at it. It turned out beautifully and I AM IN LOVE!! Washing my hair is easy and it feels so healthy and looks really nice.

My boyfriend however was not happy at all. He pretty much cracked the shits when he saw it. He said I should have warned him and that I said i would only cut a little bit off. I told him I didn’t know myself and I didn’t think I should have to message him while my hair is getting cut to get permission or a warning.

AITA for telling my classmate about periods?,13117,Not the A-hole,930,hfngb9,1593125605.0,"We're 21, for the reference.

I have mainly lovely classmates, but this guy (M) is something else, he's a year older (he studied abroad for a year and had to repeat the classes as our school is very strict) and you cannont imagine the level of annoyance. I'd describe him like a weird mix between a xenopfobic boomer and your constantly nagging 13 y.o. brother.

We were assigned a final project for our literature class and I was in the same group as him. Fun. It had to be my lucky day, because my period arrived.

Anyway, we were having a skype ""meeting"" and I wasn't well. At all. At one point M started making fun of me for looking pale and I just told him I had my period, so if he was so kind as to shut up I'd be grateful. 

Instead he continued making those clichè jests (sexist, too) about how it meant I was going to be hysterical and have a lots of pimples while crying at romcoms. 

I was so fucking agry! So I started to explain him ""the real"" struggle. How some women have fevers, how there are horrible cramps, sensitive breasts, blood, being tired, weirds poop-routines as ovaries do some creepy magic, sensitivity to smells/perfumes, feeling dirty, HOW EXPENSIVE ALL THE SHIT IS etc. Then I told him all about exhausting men who think women just fake all those struggles so they what, have their daily dose of drama? 

Long story short, it was a TED talk. Afterwards he was too shocked to say anything, and some of my girl-friends started to list their own problems. So I presume he really got the picture. (More like a whole gallery of pictures.)

We finished the project and called it a day.

One of my female friends wrote me how it was all unnecessary and we'd taken it too far, embarrassing him. She also told me she didn't want to know about my period.

AITA for buying a new phone instead of a switch my siblings could play on?,13045,Not the A-hole,1227,ehfhwu,1577700720.0,"
For Christmas this year my grandma gave me a few hundred dollars. I was thinking about buying a Nintendo switch and some game for it.

My mom and stepdad said if I bought it I would have to share it with my siblings. 

Now a few months ago my families Wii (was actually a birthday gift of mine) died. Before it died I hardly got to play the thing because my siblings were always playing on it. We tried working out a schedule, but because we all had extracurriculars after school and with homework I basically only got to play it an hour or two a week. 

I didn’t want to spend my Christmas present on something I would never get to use, so I talked to my mom about getting a newer phone instead.

She said it was fine and took me to go get it. I guess my siblings still thought I was getting a switch because when I got home they asked if we could all play it right away when they saw the Best Buy bag.

Now my siblings are all upset because I didn’t get it and they were really looking forward to it since they haven’t gotten to play games in awhile. My brother asked to play some games on my phone instead, but I said no because I didn’t feel comfortable with that.

Edit. Because loads have people have asked. My siblings are 8 and 11. I am 16.

AITA For Cutting My Daughter Out Of The Will?,13036,Not the A-hole,1236,gzus9d,1591761586.0,"*Apologies if you have already seen this and commented on it, due to a posting complication it got removed, so it has been uploaded correctly now.*

My son Jake is gay, he came out when he was 18 and me and my wife couldn't have been more proud of him! He is now 31 and his older sister Lucy is 37. We've all been a happy family until about 6 months ago, when Lucy converted to Catholicism. Neither me, my wife or my son are particularly religious. 

Since then Lucy became more distant with her Jake, and I started to notice Jake looking less jolly than his normal self. I decided to ask him about it, because I could sense something was wrong. At first he denied something was up, so I kept asking him what what was wrong until he finally broke down in tears one day. He told me that a few months back Lucy had called him to meet up.  

Apparently when they met up she had tried to talk to him about his sexuality. According to my son, she literally begged him to repent and give up his 'homosexual lifestyle,' by breaking up with his boyfriend of two years. Since then she constantly rings him and texts him begging him to repent his sin, and has even messaged his boyfriend directly to 'try and save him from hell too.' - I was livid. 

Me and my wife immediately called Lucy and demanded a 'family meeting.' We all sat round the table (me, my wife, Jake and Lucy), and we asked her about it. She literally said in front of us all 'Jake, I want you to go to Heaven, you've got to stop this, its not natural.' My wife burst into tears and I started to literally shake in rage. After a lot of screaming and crying from everyone, my wife and I eventually said something along the lines of: 'you can believe what you want, but if you dare to say anything even remotely related to Jake's life choices ever again, you will not be a part of this family.' Her response was to look Jake in the eyes and say 'can you not see what your doing is wrong, it's a violation, it's sick.'

After throwing her out of the house and telling her we would never speak to her again, we got on the phone and decided to amend our will. She now gets absolutely nothing. She arrived at our house begging to let her into our lives again, and saying not only are we letting Jake down but we are not respecting her religious beliefs

AITA for telling my wife I won't do chores until her kids do some?,13028,Not the A-hole,1203,fszqyt,1585776377.0,"ETA: Thank you, thank you, thank you for all your comments. I'm too overwhelmed to respond, I'm too overwhelmed in general right now. I am seriously grateful to everyone who shared thoughts, from YTA to NAH to everything in between. These kids are awesome and I'm truly privileged to be their stepdad. Hope my wife and I can work this out. 

Also, tip for any parents in a blended family: I loved my stepdad BECAUSE my mom was the parent. My mom never made my stepdad do things a parent should be doing.  He never had to enforce behaviors or chores. My Mom was ON IT. She was still basically a single parent and he was the support guy. So if your SO seems resentful or distant or too harsh around your kids... check yourself first. Be the parent. Then, the stepparent won't overstep. 

My (37M) beautiful wife (39F) and I have been married awhile now and she has three great kids, 12, 9 and 7. The kids are awesome. Coolest people I know.

My dad died when I was 9 and my stepdad came around 3 years later. The best thing my stepdad did was take the pressure off my mom so she could be there for us. I idolized my dad but I loved my stepdad too and being one has made me proud – I actually get a kick out of taking over the laundry so my wife can play with her kids, or fixing their bikes so they can go ride with her. I do more than 50% of the house & yard work. Happy to.

However, the only thing my wife and I ever fight about is the fact that she won't make her kids do ANY chores. Like none. They don't clear their plates, they don't sweep or vacuum, they often don't even flush. It makes me furious with her. Even when my dad DIED, my mom kept our chore chart going. She said we all had to help each other. It gave me consistency, responsibility, pride and character.

Then, all this happened. Like all of you probably, I'm overwhelmed. Now, there's three times more housework because everyone is constantly home. I can't do that much housework plus work from home and I've been raging and angry all the time.

My wife works part-time from home and gets child support from the kids' dad, who does make them do chores at his house. She has refused any and all attempts to have a conversation about how we might teach the kids to clean up and do their fair share of the housework. Guys, I am not asking them to scrub the floor with a toothbrush! I think while they're home all day, they should be learning how to do simple stuff, like help with dishes or help with laundry or sweep the floors or flush the toilets in addition to playing. They have 1-hour of school a day. They can do 30 minutes of chores and still have 10 hours to play and enjoy themselves. Everybody should do a fair share.

Because my wife refuses to even discuss this with me, I chose a different tactic.

I'm not doing any more chores until the kids do.

I'm not going to rage around being resentful, angry and exhausted all the time. Those kids are amazing - I'm not going to wreck the great relationship I built with them either. It's their mom's fault they're like this, not theirs or mine. I'll work and do basic cleaning up after myself. That's it. My wife can do everything else, or she can get everybody on board doing their fair share.

So, what do you think? My wife thinks I'm TA not supporting her when she needs it most. I think she's TA for babying her kids and overloading me. What do you think? AITA?",False,1585760545.0,2020-04-01 14:26:17

My now wife and I married in 2015 and we’ve become a big blended family a little like the Brady Bunch. I have two kids and she has two kids.

Our kids are all roughly around the same ages as well (12-17) but my step daughter/son attend school living with their dad and usually will spend summers and winters with us, with more holidays in between.

The issue: my ex in-laws (late wife’s parents) are very close to my kids so they’ve been inviting my daughters to spend summers with them in Europe (they live in London). My daughters really love this since it makes them feel closer to their mum’s heritage and they get to travel a LOT in the meantime. My in laws are very well off and will spend parts of the summer taking the girls skiing or exploring exotic locales all across Europe and even Asia.

Now my wife is feeling very annoyed at how her kids are feeling as a result. She says that while we’re supposed to be one big family, my kids are obviously being given more opportunities to succeed in life. By traveling, learning new cultures and languages, and getting elite summer internships (my oldest was an intern at the ICJ in The Hague last summer by her grandad’s connections), my wife is unsettled at the gaps between my kids and her kids. 

I honestly don’t know how to solve this. My in laws are VERY wealthy to the point I don’t think I’ll ever be able to match their level of power/money. They will always be able to provide for their grandkids in ways my step kids won’t have. My wife wants me to put “limits” on these kinds of gifts to promote equality, but I also feel like this would be unfair for my daughters, who love their grandparents and are blossoming in their summers there. 

I had a heart to heart with my step kids recently and they expressed similar views, that it’s not “fair” my daughters get the privileges they do. I’ve been trying to spend more quality time with them and taking them on special summer vacations that’s the best we can afford, but that’s still a far cry from French chateaus and Italian villas.

WIBTA if I tell my neighbor their requests are ridiculous?,13012,Not the A-hole,644,ftlv6u,1585861029.0,"Update 2:

Hi, me again, a final update for this asshole situation. I texted back and forth with the neighbor to try to resolve this amongst ourselves and quickly realized it was fruitless because I was, indeed, dealing with an asshole. Apparently they did not like the way I treated them when we worked together in a restaurant — I always took my job seriously and hospitality is now my career as where for them it was just a “summer job”.

I wrote the landlord a letter detailing the worst of what I’ve dealt with — included that neighbor has personal vendetta — and sent it electronically and in the mail. He responded after an hour or so saying that he talked to the neighbor and explained the situation and that everything should be ok now and they understand. If not, he said we will all have to have a meeting. Landlord then apologized for any inconvenience. I feel fully vindicated and hopeful the landlord realizes what’s going on. He’s no fool! Happy with the outcome and ready to NOT be the asshole to MYSELF in the future!  

Sorry that wasn’t more exciting guys!!!! 

__________________________________________________________
Update: 

About 30 minutes after I posted this, I got a call from my landlord (who has never had to call me in the 3 years I’ve lived here) saying that he got a complaint from the neighbors that I was blasting music last night at 2AM. I immediately told the landlord that I got a call from neighbor asking to turn the television down and I did. Then I proceeded to tell the landlord all of the fuckery I’ve been dealing with since this guy moved in. I sent him text receipts confirming that he was having a party, and video receipts from a separate party I recorded the night they partied until 4AM when I had a flight at 7AM. He said he will take care of it. 

I then sent the neighbor a text message asking why they called the landlord when we had an agreement to text each other if someone was being too loud and how ridiculous it was for them to even ask that due to their partying. And how absolutely nuts it was for them to call the landlord after I turned my TV off and moved to a different room for them. This resulted in the neighbor revealing they have a personal problem with me stemming from 5 years ago. I did not mention that since we live in a close knit downtown area, everybody knows everybody. I asked neighbor to get together to talk face to face about this problem and he informed me that he couldn’t talk right now, because he was getting ready for work.... at noon.... after asking me to turn my television down because he had to “work early”. Neighbor wants to get together next week to discuss their issue when it’s better for their schedule. Fucking please. 

Thanks reddit, there is some AMAZING and some HILARIOUS advice/stories in this thread. You guys rock and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate all of these suggestions for my first time dealing with a neighbor like this.




________________________________________________________
Original: 


My household is very quiet, I live a sober life and if I ever have a party it’s a small dinner party that is over by 10PM. I have a dog who rarely barks but can be loud if she runs which is a couple times per day. I work a shift job that is mostly evenings but can sometimes call for an early morning shift. 

I recently got a new downstairs neighbor. I was sad to see my old neighbor go because we rarely had problems. My new neighbor STOMPS around at all hours of the night. As soon as my neighbor moved in, they started having people over and throwing parties. The first party I gave them a free pass — perhaps a housewarming? But the parties and people over have just continued and gotten worse. The loudest and latest party they’ve had so far was blasting music, banging and screaming until 4:30AM when I had a 7AM flight. This culminated in them having a party the other night. I could hear every single person in their unit screaming while sitting on my couch watching Netflix at 1AM.

I got up to go to the kitchen and my dog ran after me. My neighbor, who was having yet another party, banged on their ceiling with a broomstick because my dog ran through the hall... while they were having a loud party. The next day I confronted them about that and made the mistake of saying “if I’m being too loud, just text me”

Well... last night I just about hit my boiling point. I’m watching a movie in my living room at 1AM - a regular activity for the past 3 years I’m living here. My neighbor calls me on my cellphone and asks me to turn my TV down because they have to work in the morning. I was honestly flabbergasted that this person who throws loud parties multiple times per week was asking me to respect their right to quiet. I turned the TV off and went and watched it in my room. 

Guys, WIBTA if I confront my neighbor today and tell them that they can’t have it both ways? That if they want right to quiet, they can’t be having parties? We can’t live a life where we constantly have to communicate about work schedules or be texting each other to be quiet.

AITA for having liquor in the apartment even though my roommate turns out to be a recovering alcoholic?,12991,Not the A-hole,2290,frnc84,1585587679.0,"My roommate and I moved in on a six month lease together. We both committed to it. 

We talked about all the basic stuff. He asked me if I was any kind of serious drinker and I said I was not. 

In hindsight I should’ve made sure his idea of serious drinker and mine were the same thing, but hindsight is 20/20. 

The whole conversation was “Hey I’m sorry if this is a little personal but I have to ask, do you drink?” And I said yah, and he said “Serious drinking, or just the occasional kind of thing?” And I said “Oh, not serious at all.” Thinking he’d probably had a bad experience dealing with a hard partying ex roommate. 

So we move in and I start stocking up my liquor cabinet and he says “Woah, what’s all this” and I tell him I have a few bottle of liquor, but not to worry, I haven’t been drunk since college (still figuring dealing with drunk guys was his concern.) 

He didn’t seem thrilled but didn’t bring it up again. 

I usually have a glass of wine with dinner. The first night I did he said “Congratulations. What’re we celebrating?” And I said “Nothing, just unwinding.” He seemed uncomfortable and I noticed we never overlapped during dinner again, but at the time didn’t think much of it at all. Never occurred to me it was intentional. 

Fast forward to today. He said “I don’t tell many people this but I have a drinking problem, I haven’t touched a drink in 6 years, but every day is still an active choice to do so, and I’m sorry but I cannot take being in the house with your liquor cabinet and wine drinking every day. Could you move some of this stuff out of the apartment like to a friend’s place or I’ll pay for storage.” 

I told him I’d have to think about it. I was leaning towards saying I can keep the liquor in my room as a middle ground. I want to be supportive and everything. But I’m not a heavy drinker at all. I really like unwinding at the end of the day. And I feel like if he needed this accommodation he should’ve said something at the outset. Now we share a house. 

But I also get for him it’s a medical condition he’s fighting and for me it’s just a recreational preference. So, I feel like I might be too quick to dismiss his full request. AITA?",False,False,2020-03-30 10:01:19
AITA for telling my SIL that she can't say her stillborn baby matters less than her living children?,12987,Asshole,2350,gb8jgy,1588323853.0,"As background: my SIL had 3 living children before her stillbirth, and then gave birth to another living child 2 years later. Her 4 Earth-side children have fairly common names, like Emma, Lauren, Sophie, and Andrew. Her stillborn daughter has a more unorthodox name, something like Soulstyce. I have one son born sleeping and had several miscarriages. I have no living children, but I'm a mom to a little boy up in Heaven.

Anyways, at Christmas, many of our family members got to meet their new baby for the first time. The subject of how his name was chosen came up, which lead to my grandmother asking why their stillborn daughter had such an ""unusual"" name compared to their living children.

My SIL explained that they gave their daughter a ""guilty pleasure"" name because it mattered less. She said she wouldn't put her living children through the experience of having such an uncommon name, but that it didn't matter when it came to their daughter because she didn't have a life to live with her name. She even joked that she spent a quarter of the time picking out their daughter's name that they did choosing their other children's names because ""it just didn't matter"" and they ""could do whatever.""

It hurt me to hear her say that. I've spent six years feeling like I have no right to call myself a mother and feeling excluded from the ""mom's club"" because my son died from circumstances beyond my control before I even got to hold him. To have my SIL, who I have supported through each and every one of her pregnancies, who I held and comforted through her stillbirth, say that her child *didn't matter* because she wasn't alive - that hurt. It felt very intensely personal. I was right across from her at the table and she said it with no remorse. I don't care if it took her 5 minutes or 5 days to choose a name for her child, I care that she said it didn't matter.

I haven't said a word about it since then. But I lost my job, I've had too much time to think, and I keep replaying the whole thing over in my mind. I've been stewing about it, I keep drawing away from her and I feel guilty. So, I called her and told her that I had been really hurt by what she said. She was very callous, immediately, telling me to get over myself and not tell her how to live her life. I got very upset and told her she couldn't talk about her daughter like she mattered less and she just outright said, ""She does matter less."" I just started to cry. I hung up and my husband consoled me for a while, but my brother called me to chew me out, saying I'd made his wife upset and she was already busy with their children and she didn't need to babysit me as well. I've gotten texts and calls from half the family, most of them blaming me for not moving past my son's death. My own mother told me it was time to start pursuing new family planning options and that I was taking my distress at my loss out on my SIL.

[Slyvy](https://live.staticflickr.com/8180/8027344838_abb1569f7c_c.jpg) has been with me for over half of my life. I bottle fed her, used paper towels to clean her bum so she'd poop-she was too young at the time to go on her own. I raised her from a week old. She was my baby girl.

He never really liked her. She was always very vocal about her desires and ruled the roost. This was her home and he came into it, therefor he should respect her. He has always felt that cats weren't real pets, they are only meant to be kept around to keep pests away.

I know he was relieved when she passed since I was spending a lot of time, effort and money to keep her quality of life good.

After she was put down, I spent 15 minutes crying to myself and petting her and talking to her. My husband pulled me into a hug and apparently gestured for the vet to take the body away. Afterwards he told me that I shouldn't have made a scene by crying and it's just an animal. He also told me that if this is the way I'm going to be then he'll have my other two cats re-homed or put down.

I'm trying to hold it together but I really resent him. He says that he's just looking out for my emotional well being but it feels more controlling. I resent his comments about how the useless cat is gone and that I should be relieved about that. 

I wish that I could talk to him, share my memories of her and openly cry. I miss her. I am grieving her loss and that feels natural to me. Am I really wrong for feeling resentful that he keeps telling me that I'm wrong to miss her and that grief is only for humans?

"AITA For Telling My GF To Not Dye Her Hair, And Getting Angry When She Did?",12936,Asshole,725,gqnpw0,1590485622.0,"READ , I KNOW THE TITLE SOUNDS BAD.

This has really been bugging me, so here we go.

Throwaway and all fake names btw.

So Sarah (24F) , my (25M) girlfriend (now ex I guess) had always had these random... 'style changes' I guess?

Like one day she'd wear skirts, or a simple dress shirt and the next she's wearing shorts and crop tops,  halter tops, tank tops etc. so her style changes *a lot.*

It bothered me, since she is very attractive, and whenever we'd go out, she gets stares and has even gotten hit-on, because they think she's single.

So, she wanted to get highlights, and her sister had this store-bought highlight thingy, and before the pandemic she borrowed it to do it, and I managed to convince not to do it, so she forgot about it and now she remembered and wanted to get dark purple highlights.

I rather prefer girls with un-dyed hair, it's just a preference so I told her that I'd rather she not do that, since it wouldn't really look good on her, and she'd ruin her hair. She told me that she thinks it'll look good on her, and plus she'll be able to just highlight them brown, or fully dye her hair back to brown if she doesn't like it.

I told her, that I wouldn't like it, since it'd ruin her hair, I didn't mean to come off controlling. She just shrugged. And we went to sleep after that, I thought it was the end of it. Then the next day, I woke up to her making breakfast with *purple highlighted hair.*

I asked her why she did that, since I told her it wouldn't look good (I still didn't like it) She said she had a 'change of heart' and that it shouldn't matter what she looks like cause personality matters

Then I said to her, she should have told me if she was going to do it, and she asked why, and I told her I'd rather know if my girlfriend was going to damage her hair. I should have chosen my words better, cause she got all defensive and told me that I shouldn't have a say in what she does with her hair and how I 'manipulated' her last time. So amidst the whole fight, the breakfast got burned  , and we were too busy arguing so it was too late to save the food and we had to throw away food.

I was tired so I said out of anger that 'This wouldn't have happened if you had just listened to me and stop being a child.'

Sarah then started yelling at me *again* saying I should cook for myself and that she shouldn't have to be my maid. I told her that she does those things by herself, I can cook and clean, but she does that so I see no reason to dismantle the system, and she likes cooking. Then when I thought the fight was over, and that she would make breakfast while I cleaned the bedroom she made breakfast for herself, ( not me)  and told me she's leaving and 'she's done with me', and now she's at her friends house.

This happened a few days ago, but I feel like she overreacted. So AITA reddit?

Edit-Holy fuck, okay, I get it, I'm the asshole. Stop threatening me. Also by 'dismantle the system' I meant that she liked cooking, and and I barely cooked (she used to nag that I'm doing everything wrong. I didn't mean it in a misogynist way.",True,1591997887.0,2020-05-26 02:33:42

I recently was on an international flight and I always try to snag the window seat so I can sleep. A woman was seated next to me and asked if I could give up my seat since it turned out that her 6 year old was apparently seated in the row across. I tried to be nice about it and said, ""Sorry, but I specifically chose this seat and I don't really want to give it up, I've been traveling for hours.""

The woman's response was, ""Well so have we! Imagine traveling with an overtired kindergartener who now won't be able to sleep since she can't sit by her mom!"" She made me look like an asshole in front of the other people on the flight, and I felt bad since it was a little kid. I agree that it probably sucks to be traveling with a little kid, but AITA for not giving up my seat?

EDIT:

1. I was seated in the window seat, the woman was in the middle seat next to me, and another passenger was in the aisle seat next to her. 6 year old kid was across in the next row over in the aisle seat. Since the mother and the kid were only one seat away from each other, it wasn't so much an issue of not being seated next to each other, but more that the mom wanted her kid to have the window seat so she could sleep
2. This wasn't an issue of separation and the kid being scared. Her mom was ONE seat away. This was an issue of wanting the seat for her kid just so she could sleep
3. For those asking duration of the flight: 6 hours
4. For those asking ""Why didn't she ask the other person in the aisle seat?"" Because she specifically wanted the window seat for her child",False,1571452384.0,2019-10-18 17:21:52

So we’ve been doing a lot of research over night (obviously I haven’t slept well) and found how non invasive the procedure could be, and the results come back in a week or so. We’re gonna go to the girls parents with this information and try to explain why it’s important for all of us to know. Thank you all for your input, I’ll try and post an update when I know more. Also, as a side note, I wouldn’t consider myself overly controlling or a “helicopter parent”. As I said, my son knows about safe sex, knows sex is normal, and has even asked my husband for condoms in the past, as we told him he should do whenever he needed to. The constant supervision we kept them under only applies to what happens IN OUR HOUSE, and I don’t think that’s an outlandish rule. Just because we’re sex positive doesn’t mean we’re celebratory or encouraging of it. 

It’s almost comical that this of all things would be what made me get a reddit account, even more comical that I’m turning to the internet for input, but I just wanna put it out there that I’m set in my thinking. I just wanna know if I’m an asshole for it. 

My 15 year old son came to my husband and I last week, telling us that his girlfriend is 7 months pregnant. As someone who became a mother very young, i am devastated and so deeply disappointed. They’ve been together for about a year, but we always thought it was a kids thing, nothing harmless. Regardless, when under our watch, we kept them under CONSTANT supervision, so this was all a shock. We know the girls parents and believed we were all on the same page about our kids. 

Turns out we were wrong. When we called them, they spun some bullshit about how their daughter had already told us, basically placing the blame on their child for us not knowing she’s been pregnant for SEVEN months. On top of this, they’ve only known for about a month or two meaning she’s had basically no prenatal care. 

We were trying to figure out what our next steps should be, so I called my older brother. Not wanting him to keep a secret from his family, I told him I’d individually call his wife and two daughters to tell them myself. When I called the youngest one, 16, who is close to my son, her first reaction was “I wonder if it’s even his.”

Upon hearing this, I immediately questioned my son, who then informed me of their very... colorful relationship. She’s apparently a serial cheater, even though I didn’t even think that was a factor in a 15yo’s relationship. I’ve never felt like such a bad mother listening to all that was going on in my sons life that I didn’t know about, knowing he’s never trusted me enough 

After this I contacted the parents of his girlfriend, and as gently as I could, informed them that we wanted a paternity test done. They FLIPPED, they were pissed about what I was accusing their daughter of, and saying the trauma of even bringing that up to her is too much for a heavily pregnant child. While I might agree, this is my child’s life that’s gonna be deeply impacted too. 

So my husband and I decided we’re gonna keep trying to get a paternity test done no matter what it takes. AITA for demanding this? Am I being unreasonable? As bad of a parent as I feel like I am right now for letting this happen, I feel I’m no where near as bad as the girls parents...

EDIT: just to clarify, weve gone over this with my son and he’s on board and understands why a paternity test is important.

ANOTHER EDIT: We have DEFINITELY discussed safe sex with our son, as I said I was a very young mother and it was important to me to make sure they’re educated. I in no way blame the girl, I just want to protect my son.",False,1563635338.0,2019-07-20 00:51:56

I look pretty black, hardly aboriginal. I spent my entire life defending myself to both the black community and the aboriginal community. I have to admit, I have always identified more with my black roots than aboriginal ones but since I now have a son whose father is full aboriginal, it’s very important to me to embrace *both* cultures. This is relevant. 

Recently, we went to a local store in our small Canadian town that sells handmade mukluks by the aboriginal community. We wanted to get some for all three of us. It was just my son and I in the store - my husband was not with us. I go up to the register and the cashier doesn’t greet me or even acknowledge me. She starts ringing up the mukluks, chucks the boxes in a bag and says “payment?” With a dirty look. I pull out my debit card and say “debit please”. She then mumbles under her breath “another one trying to steal our culture”. So I said “sorry, what?” And she says “yeah, you heard me. You’re just like the rest of them, coming here to steal what isn’t yours”. 

I immediately got upset because I AM aboriginal and I’m not stealing anything. This is just as much my culture as it is hers. I didn’t know what else to do, so I pulled out my treaty card from my wallet, put it on the desk, and said “I want to speak to your manager please”. She turned bright red and called another woman over. I explained what happened and said I wasn’t looking for anything except for comments like that to not be repeated. As I said before, I spent my entire life defending myself to BOTH communities i am supposed to be apart of. I also don’t feel like I need to justify why I’m buying mukluks. The manager basically said she would deal with it.

I don’t know what happened to the cashier, if she got in trouble or not. But on the drive home I felt really embarrassed and now I feel like I’m TA and should’ve just ignored her and moved on with my day. So AITA for speaking to her manager and *potentially* getting her in trouble?

Edit: thank you for Silver, kind stranger! 

I’d like to add some details for those who are confused - “aboriginal” isn’t only a term used in Australia. It’s commonly used to refer to native people in Canada. Within the last few years the terminology has shifted from aboriginal to First Nations, or indigenous people. But aboriginal isn’t suddenly wrong to say.

For flower girl, we had a choice between my two nieces, Amber and Katie. They're both eight and it was a tough decision. Unfortunately for my perfect day I felt shallow and since Amber has more of a typical angelic ''cute'' appearance (very long hair, glasses, big smile) I picked her. Her parents also convinced me she deserved it because she got top marks in some assessment her school did. 

During the wedding prep Katie and her dad (my brother) kept telling me that Amber had been bullying her about the fact she didn't get the job. The girls have never liked each other for reasons I don't know. I didn't pay too much mind to it since I was too caught up in myself.

On the wedding morning I got to witness the bullying myself and it was pretty cruel. Amber (and keep in mind this is an eight year old child) told Katie that she'd never get married because she's too ugly. I could imagine how upsetting this would be for a child and I made Amber apologise and also took away the flower girl job and gave it to Katie. Amber was crying throughout the wedding day, and for the past days I haven't heard anything from her dad my other brother.

I can't imagine how upsetting those comments would be, and at that point Katie, who had never been anything other than well behaved deserved it more than Amber.",False,False,2019-10-02 01:41:45
AITA for not giving my kidney to my half/sister?,12842,Not the A-hole,2071,gtbgzn,1590859427.0,"AITA for not giving my half sister my kidney?

Hello Reddit, this is a throwaway for obvious reasons and I am on mobile.

Past:

So I (14M) was born from an affair between my mom and my dad. She already had a (1yrF/my half-sister). My dad didn’t know my mom was married when they started hooking up but when she got pregnant her husband found out and left her. 

My mom was going to abort me but my dad paid her a lot if money.

She signed over rights and was not part of my life financially or emotionally. She just birthed me. I don’t blame her or hold men/ women who leave accountable.

Everyone from her side know about me however they don’t care.

Well, my mom and her husband got back together for my half-sister and my dad ended up starting a business and earning about 8 figures yearly. 

Present:

My mom contacted my dad saying she wanted to get to know me better. I was skeptical and not sure because I didn’t really think about her often, but I decided I would meet her. I met up with her and her family and it was pretty awkward . These people were not my main family. I had never even met my ‘step-dad’ or sis.

I’d be talking with my moms side for about 2 months when at a family gathering they all sat me down like I was in a interrogation and told me that the reason they contacted me was because that my half-sister has kidney failure and was basically dying. They said they needed a transplant and that I was the only hope. 

I was pissed. I couldn’t believe them. I just left and my dad picked me up. I told him and he said that it’s your choice to see if I’m illegible you give before I make my decision. I arranged to get tested.

I think they thought to this as me agreeing and told everyone the ‘good’ news. 

After some time and talks with family I told them that I would not be donating my kidney. They had done nothing for me and if the only reason to contact me was for my kidney then I didn’t want anything to do with them. I got loads of hateful messages and calls from people angry, but decided to stand by my decision and I blocked most of the people spamming me. 

After that I got a call from my sister saying I had given false hope and calling me a douche. Insulting me and telling me my life has been a fairytale and hers has been a wreck. I do feel bad but I simply do not want to give up my kidney. I could give it with no extreme consequences you could say, but why would I for people who remembered me and tried buttering me up only for my kidney. 

A few days ago I got a call from the remainder of them saying my sister was in critical condition and was going to die and I was her only hope. Spanning me and sending me photos of her.

I consulted my family and friends are calling me a massive douche saying I can save a life but I am choosing not to yada yada. They said she did nothing wrong and deserves to live and I am pretty much hated right know, apart from my dad who is on my side. 

So AITA?

Edit: Hey guys, thanks for all the comments giving me advice and even the ones shaming me for expressing your opinion! I haven’t been able to respond to all of them but I’m trying to read them all. I am gonna get a new number so they can’t contact me and my dad and I are going no contact with his family until they apologise. Surprisingly a few actually have so this has gone better than I expected. I don’t have an update on my sisters condition but I have suggested it to them and they are deflecting it. I will update if her condition worsens. This has made me appreciate my dad even more and I’m lucky. Thanks!",False,1591094966.0,2020-05-30 10:23:47
AITA for walking out of the hospital very soon after giving birth when my husband brought his mom in?,12826,Not the A-hole,1999,f9v8ba,1582761141.0,"My husband and mom have this weirdly close relationship which has been a source of conflict before, usually when he has trouble telling her no.

When I was pregnant, I told my husband that I want it to be just us two in the hospital and we could have friends and family over the house later.

I went into labor prematurely, and my husband rushed us to the hospital in my car. It was unexpected. I gave birth without an epidural because I couldn't get one with the timing, it was the hardest most painful thing I could imagine.

I didn't get hardly any time with our baby at all before the doctors and nurses had to take her away and I was just laying in bed feeling awful, in pain, feeling like ""did I do something to make this happen?"" I had some risk factors like stress and a past struggle with disordered eating that's left me at a low weight.

Then suddenly my husband's mother came in, asking where the baby was, asking a lot of medical questions like how premature, had I been resting enough during pregnancy, how was the baby... That really hurt when I'd been questioning myself so much also.

And my husband was just talking her through it all even though I had told him nobody but us in the hospital. 

I spoke up and said I wanted to be alone with my husband to rest, and he actually said that it'd just be a few minutes, they'd step out to the lounge. I didn't feel any better, I didn't want to be alone and I didn't want her possibly pushing back into the room.

Now onto the questionable part...

I should explain I grew up in a pretty abusive traumatic environment and that's given me the defense mechanism of just running when I am feeling scared or overwhelmed. It's something I'd thought I'd gotten past with therapy but I guess that moment I was feeling worse than I had in a very long time. 

I got up, kinda zoning out the pain because I felt so anxious. I got covered up with my long winter parka and pulled on my boots, and grabbed my purse and made a (slow) break for the parking garage. 

I got to my car and by the time I was there the pain had really set in, I felt dizzy and was scared of passing out if I drove, so I just laid across the backseat.

I lost track of time before a nurse found me, and at that point they brought me back inside and put me in a private area for treatment. 

It's been a month since then now and it's caused so much trouble.

I'm upset my husband didn't keep it to just us.

He says that he didn't know how serious I meant it; plus with the premature labor it was like all our plans for how my birth would go were out the window. His mother was just concerned.

He's also really bothered I left, he said it's serious destructive and I wasn't thinking about my own health or safety.

His mom has said that I seem too instable to be a mother.

AITA for being furious that my BF used a keepsake of mine for his art without permission?,12826,Not the A-hole,1115,gvipxc,1591170088.0,"UPDATE: I wasn't allowed to post an update post. So long story short, I have my tooth back (BF threw it in my mailbox in an envelope, without a card or anything, so idk if I'm supposed to take that as an apology or if he's pissed). Tooth seems unharmed. Haven't talked to BF ever since this happened and don't know what will happen with us. But, I have the tooth back, and am actually now planning to get a tattoo of it so if it ever DOES get lost I will still have it with me. Thanks for everyone assuring me I was not TA.

I've had this shark tooth ever since I was maybe 11, I found it on a beach on vacation. At the time it was just cool, because what are the chances to just walk on a random beach and find a shark tooth? In time it became an important emotional keepsake for me that reminded me of all the 'good' parts of my childhood. Honestly most of it wasn't very good, so, extra important. I just really like this stupid tooth and whenever I was upset I would just rub it in my hands and feel comforted.

My BF saw it in my room early on and I told him this story and he was like hey cool. To be fair at that point I didn't go in detail, just said it's important to me. Some years went by. We don't live together yet but most of the time he comes to my place because it's larger. One day a few months back I was looking for my shark tooth and it wasn't in the two or three places it has been in. No biggie – I am honestly pretty messy and often 'lose' stuff somewhere only to find it in my sock drawer a week later or something. I kept searching, confident it would resurface because it has never left my flat. After two weeks or so I began to worry, took my vacuum cleaner apart and started panicking about maybe having dropped it in the trash SOMEHOW and that it may be gone for good. 

Eventually, my BF is over and notices that one of my drawers was kinda messy, because I had gone through it and searched every nook. I tell him I can't find the tooth and  he was like ooh... that's a shame I'm sure you'll find it. I didn't notice any weird vibes so I guess he's got a good pokerface. 

One more week.... he says (over text) ok I need to tell you something, don't be mad... and sends me a picture of some art project and it has MY SHARK TOOTH IN IT. Apparently he had to do a sculpture type thing for university and it's like a viking ship that is made half out of seashells, driftwood etc with my tooth as the 'centerpiece'.  And he tells me he saw the tooth in my flat when he was over and I was in the shower, so he put it in his pocket to 'ask me later' then forgot about it and when he re-discovered it at home he supposedly thought it was part of some other materials he had gotten elsewhere and just went ahead and used it. He claims he didn't remember until it was too late. So I tell him he's gonna give it back to me ASAP and he goes ummh well it might take a few months because it's in an exhibition and also he used superglue so he doesn't know if he can get it off. 

I was just DONE with the conversation and stared at the wall for like 30 minutes. After I had calmed down a bit I now genuinely am not sure if I am overreacting or not. Like yeah it's 'just' a tooth but he didn't ask me?? I can believe him that he doesn't remember our short conversation a few years ago about it. But who just takes something from someone's bedroom and slaps it on their artwork without saying anything? I feel like if I see him in person I'd have to struggle to not flip out.

AITA for not wanting my 11 year old niece to illustrate my children's book?,12815,Not the A-hole,761,feed12,1583534406.0,"So I wrote a kids story a while ago and have kind of been sitting on it. Recently I showed it to a fellow writing friends and she encouraged me to send it to an editor who said he could help me publish it. I was excited of course cause this has been a dream of mine.

I was telling my family about this and my niece begged me to let her draw the art for my book. I love my niece I really do and I want to encourage her as much as possible. She loves to draw and doodle, but here is the thing.  her art is mostly copied off the internet, or very crudely drawn people. She has talent and I know given time and practice she will be an amazing artist. As of now though it's not anywhere I need it to be.

I tried to explain to her, that for this project I have to go with someone more skilled. She was not happy. Sadly my niece has never been told no by my brother or his wife. they also think I should let her do it. My brother told me ""it would be a bonding moment."" My sister in law said ""it would mean so much to her to help.""

The art I need has a lot of action. Needs to have someone who can draw out whole scene not just a person here or a oddly misshapen dog there. she would have to make her art original and do more then just copy it.

AITA for telling her no?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: So I had a long talk with my niece after school. me and her went for a drive, got Ice cream and went to our favorite place to sit and hang out away from her parents.

I told her I did not mean to make it sound like I though her work was bad. (Someone please write a walk through for the clueless adults with no kids) I told her that with this kind of career you're kind of locked in to whatever the people who buys the rights to your book decide.

I also showed her a few of the post by people who worked in the Biz. who talked about the hard work it takes to make a kids book come to life. thank you whereegosdare and VeryVeryTexan for that info. she was kind of shocked that is was not a simple straight forward draw a picture and submit it. She is still very interested in becoming an artist but thinks an illustrator is not her cup of tea.

Her mother and father are avoiding me right now, cause I blew up after they started in again about how I'm ""killing their little girls dreams."" Honestly My brother is worse then my SIL, but you can only strangle a sibling so many times before your parents think you might actually be trying to kill them.

I also took a lot of peoples advice to heart and started to look for an agent rather than self publish. Figured I would let all this kind of stuff be their issue. I just want to write stories.

&#x200B;

Edit : many of you have asked and yes the guy I was talking to wanted to charge me. Almost 6 grand for editing and illustrating. he then offered to cut me a deal 3 grand off his price. but he wanted half up front. He also said he would not be able to help me with publishing, I pretty much ran away screaming. so thank you guys for the advice on that. I have started looking for an agent now. 

Thank you everyone for the advice and letting me know that I was NTA, also for helping me see I hurt my niece. Today her father started acting ""cute"" about this situation and trying to rib my niece in to playing the tears again. She shut him down and told him that She did not want to be an illustrator cause and I quote ""I'm not putting up with all that!"" 

they are still avoiding me or keeping my two nieces as buffers between us. It's my house so you can bet they can't ""hide"" for long. ",False,1583638407.0,2020-03-06 14:40:06

AITA for leaving my own surprise party?,12791,Not the A-hole,1481,cq6dzw,1565796945.0,"I (17f) have been struggling with some depression after my dad passed. I spend about a year isolated, never leaving my room, just laying in bed all day miserable. I started going to therapy and working two days a week, but the moment I come home I will still crawl right into bed. I just have no energy. 

My 17th birthday was a few days ago and my mom was asking if I wanted a party, she thought it would be good for me. I told her several times that no, I don't want a party, pretending to be totally fine and happy is exhausting. Especially with that many people around. 

But when I came back from work and opened the door, the house was filled with people. (Maybe 10% family I'm not close to and 90% my moms friends). I didn't know what to do so I walked back out again, I grabbed a slice of pizza somewhere and walked around the park, hoping that when I came back they would be gone. 

While at the park my phone blew up with texts from my family and mom, that I was ungrateful and spoiled and didn't deserve nice things they tried to do. 

I came home about two hours after I left the party, my mom was super pissed. I tried to explain but she thinks it's just excuses. 


Was I the asshole? My mom is still not speaking to me, and I do feel bad that she went though all that effort for nothing.



Edit: my mom and dad divorced a few years back if that matters. And I do have friends that my mom knows, but none of them were invited.


Edit 2: 

I'm already in therapy and its helping.

 This wasn't meant as a validation post, your parent and family telling you you're wrong will make you doubt yourself. 

And I was dead on my feet, I had just worked 9 hours and I just wanted to sleep. I'm an introvert so social interactions already cost a lot of energy, so I couldn't have just 'faked in for an hour'

Pretending to be fine when you're not takes a lot of energy, and I couldn't at that point.

AITA for refusing to share any of my baking with my sister?,12797,Not the A-hole,735,gc82kf,1588461260.0,"So I (16F) like to bake, I buy my own ingredients and make something every week or so. I share with my mom and sister (21F), and sometimes her friends if they're over. Its not like I can eat everything myself anyway. This happens every week ish, for the past year? Year and a half? For a while. 

So I few days ago when I finished work (grocery store) I texted my sister to ask if there was any food, or if I needed to buy some. She told me there was food, so I went straight home. 

When I came home there was no food, there was meat in the freezer but no time to defrost, no bread, no eggs, not much. Couldn't order food, since it was past 9 pm. 

My sister had ordered two pizzas, so I asked if I could have a few slices, I offered to pay for them. She refused, she wanted to eat them for lunch the next day. I offered to pay for the whole pizza, so she could order a fresh one tomorrow for lunch, she refused again. 

This wouldn't have been an issue if she told me there was no food, I would have bought something on my way home. But she apperently didn't check. I ate some plain rice with salt, it wasn't too bad. But I'm still annoyed she's been eating my baking all this time, and couldn't spare two slices of pizza. I even offered to pay, she doesn't pay for the baking, even though she makes much more than I do. She's been acting a bit entitled with the baking already, getting annoyed when I didn't make something she wanted or enough for her to take to her friends, so this was extra annoying. 

So the next time I baked something and she came to grab some I told her no. I don't want to share. She got annoyed and told me I could have some pizza (which had been in the fridge for 3 days) if it's *such* a big deal. I refused again, I don't get much joy from cooking for her anymore. 

My mom thinks it's petty, but doesn't want to get involved. My sister has been huffy about it. But I don't feel like I have to share at this point.

AITA for wanting to go home with my wife after our wedding instead of my mom's to have sandwiches with family?,12783,Not the A-hole,1712,fc33hi,1583135689.0,"I'm getting married this weekend and am looking forward to it so much. My soon to be wife is amazing and her family is just as awesome. My family on the other hand, well, lets just say I'm the black sheep of this family because I'm not an entitled person or arrogant SOB.

So, I have a lot of family coming into town from up north (we live in Texas and extended family lives mainly in the upper midwest). I didn't even want to invite the majority of them in the first place because I don't know who they are and don't have much of a relationship with them. A few weeks ago my mom said that she and one of the cousins talked about having a post wedding sandwich dinner at my mom and dads since A) we aren't having dinner at the wedding and B) this will be the first time a lot of this extended family has gotten together down in Texas. So my mom said ""Your dads cousin and I are thinking of this after your wedding, around 5:30 and then going to your brothers hockey game at 6:15"" Me-""Ok, have fun"" ""You're not going to come?"" ""No, wife and I are going to order pizza and enjoy our first night as man and wife"" ""Oh, ok"". And I thought that was that

Two weeks later, same thing. Mom ""It would mean a lot if you and your wife would come have dinner at the house with everyone"" Me- ""I've already told you we have plans"" ""I know, but it would mean so much to the family that you never get to see"" ""We. Have. Plans."" ""Ok, sorry for trying to do something nice"". Meanwhile, I'm filling in my soon to be wife on this and she's like ""Is your family crazy? That's our wedding night and we get to spend it the way WE WANT TO"" I tell her I know but this is what's happening and it probably won't be dropped.

Then, last night, I'm watching the Stars v. Blues game with my mom, youngest brother and his gf when my mom says ""Your other brother is texting you, please answer him because he's bugging me now."" my other brother (who I care for but don't have the greatest relationship with) texts me ""Hey, what's this I hear that you aren't coming to dinner after the wedding?"" ""It's exactly as it sounds"" ""Why not?"" ""We have plans"" ""To do what?"" ""Husband and wife plans"" He sends back a puking emoji. I text the future Mrs. saying ""WE ARE NOT GOING TO MY MOMS SATURDAY"" She can't believe they are still trying to get us to go and doesn't understand why they won't take no for an answer.

I asked my grandma about this who said ""It's your wedding. Don't tell anyone what your doing or where your going afterwards. You spend the night with your wife. You're entitled to that""

So, reddit, almighty R-Slash, anyone who reads this, am I the asshole for not wanting to go to my moms the night of my wedding?

AITA for calling ourselves vegan?,12775,Not the A-hole,2281,gdktg8,1588657314.0,"So we’re both vegan and have been for years. 

Last year we got a beautiful cat who is the grand baby neither of our parents will ever have. 

She’s obviously an obligate carnivore and we’ve been feeding her kibble and wet food. 

Unfortunately, where she came from wasn’t a very good situation and she had horrible teeth when we rescued her. It hasn’t come to a point where she’s painful and doesn’t want to eat kibble but if it does, wet food will just make it worse. 

We went on a website for rawfeeding animals and bought her some chicken necks and chicken hearts. According to the vet, this should encourage her to use her teeth as it smell “more appetising” than space nuggets. 

We’ve obviously been quite uncomfortable with this as it’s raw meat in our otherwise vegan home but we’d do anything for our little gremlin so it’s worth it. 

We’ve since had some friends over who were horrified when we got raw meat out and asked us if we weren’t vegan and we said that we were and still are, but that kitty is not. 

They’re now saying we’re fake vegans and that we don’t care about animal welfare if we’re feeding her raw meat. 

We don’t see the issue, as these are part of a chicken that humans wouldn’t eat and we are following what our vet told us to keep our baby at optimal health. In our minds, these parts of already slaughtered animals would otherwise just be thrown away. 

This has created quite a bit of drama in our friend group as some people are now accusing us of being hypocrites while the other half say that we’re just caring for our cat. 

Are we the assholes here? 

Edit 1: if we didn’t feed her raw meat she would have kibble instead but she’s reluctant to eat that when her teeth are sore.

Edit 2: first of all, holy shit. We did not expect this response. We posted this on a whim because we were unsure if we should stop calling ourselves vegan or not. Not feeding her meat was never an option. 

Secondly this blew up over night. We went to bed with 20 comments and now there’s over 1000. That’s crazy. We’ll get around to the comments eventually but please know that we’re reading them as fast as we can! 

Thank you for the awards!

Edit 3: here’s the [cat tax](https://i.imgur.com/QFng2By.jpg) you thirsty animals.

Edit 4: her teeth are not currently painful (AFAWK) as she’s had them cleaned earlier this year. We’re trying to prevent it from getting painful again with this food. It also won’t be the only thing she’s fed as she’s still getting regular car food and getting these as “treats” because they taste nicer than space nuggets.

Edit 5: please don’t send us direct messages trying to convince us to feed her a vegan diet. Cats are fine on a vegan diet until they’re not. Cats also don’t show signs of illness until they’re very poorly. We’re not going to feed her a vegan diet.",False,1588700302.0,2020-05-04 22:41:54

I ran into the room seeing my daughter trashing and breaking my sons room because she did not like how my son is not allowing her to use and break his things. I saw that and was mad because this was not the only time my daughter did that and it was the 6th time. I was done with her behavior and I told her I am tired of her not respecting other people's property in the house which was a rule set in kindergarten. 

I told her that I am kicking her and she has a month to pack her stuff and find a place. She asked why can't I kick out my older son and not her. I told her that my older son never broke or screamed like a five year old and that he pays rent, helps with bills and follows the rules we set for him. She was threw a fit of rage and left and pack her stuff and went to a friends house. Her friends mom came in and asked me to reconsider my stance and allow her back in and I refused.

Edit- thank you for those who gave me your opinions.  I am going to let my daughter back in the house in a couple of conditions. The first one is that she has to apologize to my son. The second one is that my daughter has to go to therapy. The third condition is she has to pay for a new speaker and help pay for repairs of the phone that was broken which my son has. The final condition is that she is not allowed to ruin property and if she has an issue with my son she has to bring it up with me.

*UPDATE* So, my birthday was 11th of January, my parents were seeming nicer than usual the entire week beforehand, which might have been because they had time off work or they had a surprise.

The outcome was somewhere in the middle of what I was expecting though, on my birthday, they told me that they were sorry for buying my sister a car for Christmas when I deserved one and really needed it more than her, so they told me that they’d given me $10k to be able to afford something I’d really like and enjoy taking care of, and also to drive to and from work, to school/uni and everything else.

The outcome couldn’t have really been much better than this one especially since they originally said they’d help with 5k toward the car I want, so I’m pretty happy with it, not gonna complain anymore about the situation, I just hope they stop the favouritism and obvious extra love and support they give to my sister all the time.

The specific verse I'm thinking of is Matthew 6:1 ""Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven."" (NIV).

Which I take to mean - do good deeds, but not so you can show off about them, because it's good to do good things. Treat people well, take care of them etc, but don't then showcase how amazing you are for doing them.

They've been here 3 weeks already, and will be here 3 more. I wasn't sure about moving them in because my parents, mum especially, have been a bit... funny about my relationship (we're both women). My fiancee said that she was fine with them staying, and that being around us might actually get them more comfortable with it.

On coming in, mum and dad gave us the whole ""don't worry, we won't intrude, you won't even notice us"" and predictably within 24 hours we were acutely aware of their presence. They react to everything we do with a comment or them pulling a face or something. They once told us to ""save it for the bedroom"" when we kissed, and been told to ""put the bedroom eyes away"" when we just looked at each other. They're good about knocking when we're in our room but communal areas are presenting a serious issue.

Then tonight while I was cooking dinner my fiancee came into the kitchen. I asked her to set the table, and as she walked past me she touched my arse, and mum saw. At dinner mum said we needed to have a talk, and went on to say that she saw the PDA and she would ""appreciate a little more discretion"", and then basically went into a longer version of ""save it for the bedroom"" but this time adding that we're ""stuck together"" so let's try and make it comfortable for everyone and presented it as a hygiene issue because we were in the kitchen.

This really pissed me off. Honestly it's pissed me off for 3 weeks now, this was probably just where I hit boiling point, but to be actually sat down and given a talking to about PDA with my fiancee in our own home at 28 years old would probably make most people hit boiling point.

I said that this is our home and we should be able to express affection, especially as we're doing them a favour letting them stay with us, so not only will we not go out of our way to make them more comfortable, but we're going back to our regular PDA levels starting now.

Mum said that this was the opposite of what she wanted going into the conversation and she feels that I'm being immature by saying we'd go heavier on the PDA from now on, and said ""we're still your parents, young lady"". I responded ""and this is my house. My roof, my rules.""

Mum then got up and stormed into the guest room and has said she won't come out until I apologise. My fiancee is happy I said something (and I admitted I should have a lot sooner) but dad is pushing me to apologise, not for the rest of it, but specifically for the use of ""my roof, my rules"" as mum used that on me constantly as a kid and feels I'm throwing that back in her face, but dad is being otherwise reasonable and says she shouldn't have talked to me like that, it's just that one phrase has really upset mum.

There is a group project worth 30% of our final marks and we have to create a journal article based on whatever we like as long as we have sufficient data. Anyways I was assigned in a group I can already tell isn't exactly top tier (we can't pick). Girl A seems okay albeit the ""go with the flow type"" and the other person is definitely older who isn't giving me good outward appearance vibe.

so we all talked and agreed to do sections as opposed to working together because girl B doesn't have a car and I don't want to do it in school as parking is expensive. So it was decided Girl B will do abstract and intro, I will do methods and results (since I didn't really trust them), Girl A will do discussion, conclusion, and references.  We all decided what to do and I told them I will keep communication open and email them both findings as I go so they could do their parts. I have been emailing constantly since mid October  (project is due Nov 20). I scheduled a meeting on the 13th just to touch bases and see how they are doing.

During the meeting we showed each other the work and omg the abstract and the intro is like written by a high schooler. It seemed like she did it the night before, it barely described what we are trying to do. So I called her out on it and told her I'm doing the heavy lifting and the 2 parts she has are literally the easiest sections. She proceeded to tell us how she's has a part time job and on top of that she is raising a kid and just went on and on how hectic her life is, and then offhandedly insulted me saying because I don't have a job and a kid I wouldn't understand. I get that I wouldn't but university is OPTIONAL, I don't think you should get a pass simply because your life is ""hectic"" but whatever. So I said fine email me a second draft on Saturday the 16th. I just got it today (the 17th) because she said her kid was sick so she had and picked up extra shifts. I read it and it is still lacking (keep in mind I gave her pointers).

I also can't get behind the idea of doing the bare minimum simply because it's not a priority to you, but maybe because I'm not a mom yet I can't fathom what its like so I'm not as empathetic.

He's been homeschooled for the last two years because of how severe the bullying got.

And it kills me to say it but he's never had an actual friend other than his younger sister. We've tried so hard to facilitate friendships but it's never clicked.

Seven months ago, we got new neighbors. My son and their son were the same age and they started hanging out.

My wife and I were happy beyond words. My son was also extremely happy to finally have a friend his own age. 

Last month, we were made aware of videos the boy was making of my son and sending them to children from his school. Very cruel words were used in the video, including the ""r"" slur.

We were heartbroken to find out that our son was aware of the videos and was allowing his ""friend"" to make fun of him just so they could hang out. 

Despite his protests, I brought up the videos with the boy's parents. I was furious. To their credit, they were extremely apologetic and the mother was so upset she cried.

The boy was very embarassed and was made to apologize to my son. But he's now refusing to become friends with my son again, which has devastated him.

I'm now second guessing all my actions and I'm wondering if I should have just reached out to the boy in private. My son didn't want me to involve the parents but I did it anyway.

I'm feeling very guilty. My wife is also very upset over the while thing. We've already started therapy for our son. Just wondering if I did the right thing here. My son won't even talk to me anymore.",False,False,2020-02-20 15:58:55
AITA for having an abortion days before my niece's funeral?,12716,Not the A-hole,1390,ey8or9,1580772348.0,"Sounds bad. But let me explain. 

I am not from the US. I live in a conservative country. Although abortion is not strictly illegal, its all hush hush. To the point, where unless you are vouched by someone, the doctor will deny that he/she performs abortion, even if you ask them. It because if someone finds that a particular doctor does this, they might start getting threats. 

My sister was 2 days past her due date when I found out that I was pregnant. She is 10 years older than me. I am still in college. Me and boyfriend decided it's best to abort. So, one of my friend's father is a doctor. So I asked her to ask him to get me an appointment with some good doctor in the city. I was 7 weeks pregnant by then. 

One week passed. My friend was in the process of getting me an appointment when my sister went into labour and gave a still birth. All of us were very devastated. I was the child's godmother of sorts. I was also feeling absolutely crushed. We planned to have a funeral a week later. 

3 days before the funeral, my friend came though for me. I was 8 and half weeks pregnant by then. She got me an appointment for the next day. I spoke to doctor over the phone and when I asked her I could postpone it, she advised me not to wait. 

As this was a trying time for my family, I decided not to tell anyone except my mother. I told her in secret and explicitly told her not to tell anyone. I just wanted to let her know because I usually tell her about all the medical stuff that I do. My boyfriend was going to give me a ride to the hospital. 

That day I was in a lot of pain and I came home and rested. Next day, I was bleeding a little, but nothing unbearable. I wanted to go to my sister's house to help with the funeral arrangements. 

I went to her house and learn that somehow she found out about my abortion. She took me to her room and yelled at me about how insensitive and childish and selfish I am. She also yelled a lot of things about how I didn't deserve that child and if I loved her at all, I would have spoken or asked her permission before I did this. She also yelled about how she could have changed my mind and adopted the child, if only I would have talked to her. I felt pretty shitty already and I didn't argue or say anything to her. After she finished yelling at me, she forbid me from coming to the funeral next day. 

This was a about a month ago but that's the last the last we both spoke. Neither of us attempted to talk to the other one after this. 

My mom thinks that it's my fault and I should apologize to her. My boyfriend thinks that I have nothing to apologise for. I honestly have no clue what to do or what to apologize for. 

I understand that what she did was because of the pain she was in. She was pro choice and I know she didn't mean what she told me. But she however denied me the chance to say goodbye to my godchild. I don't think she should apologize for what she yelled at me, but I think she should atleast apologize for banning me from the funeral.

"Aita for changing my swimsuit after feeling uncomfortable at a pool party, and than “embarrassing” people when I was asked about it?",12713,Not the A-hole,1749,hdza68,1592883795.0,"This happened on Memorial Day

I’m a 22 year old female. A family friend/neighbor has a large backyard that they love to throw parties in. My family is pretty close with them and usually goes whenever there’s a party. If I’m busy with something my parents don’t care if I miss these events but if I don’t have any plans they make me go with them and my younger siblings.

Over the past 2 or so years, a couple of my dads friends or adults in the neighborhood have been sorta creepy to me at these events. They sometimes make remarks about why I don’t have a boyfriend and how they find it strange. Maybe it’s not that weird but it kinda creeps me out. Or if I go grab a beer, they try to draw out convos about me being old enough to drink now or asking me about my alcohol preferences.

On the day of this party, I was already having a shitty day since I fought with my mom earlier and I was sort of on edge at the party. I was hanging out in the pool, and I went to get out because I had to pee. I felt eyes on me, like some of the men at this party were treating me like I was that girl in the pool scene in Fast Times.

I had sunglasses on and ended up making eye contact with the house owner who seemed to space out with his eyes resting on me as I walked inside the house. After using the restroom and feeling very uncomfortable, I walked back home and changed out of the bikini I was wearing and put on the ugly one piece I had to wear in high school swim class.

I arrived back at the pool and swam when my mom called me over to her and a group of neighbors/adults at the party. She asked me why I left and put on another swimsuit.

I said something like “I was feeling uncomfortable with all these men who are dads age staring at me” an awkward silence filled the area and my mom looked at me signaling “are you fucking kidding me” I asked her why she was looking at me that way. She apologized to the adults and I walked away.

After sitting in the hot tub for a bit, my dad came up to me and sort of whispered that he heard whaT I said, and it made a lot of people uncomfortable and maybe I should apologize. I barked at my dad loudly, and T this point people were looking at me. I yelled for him to “Tell mr. (Last name) to stop being a fucking pervert then”

At this point, the man who I name dropped’s wife started yelling at me. Telling me I’m a little punk and I need more respect for my elders. And how disgusting it was of me to accuse people of that. I just told her “don’t worry your husband wasn’t the only one who was staring, and I am very uncomfortable that the neighbors who knew me since I was a toddler now ogle over me in my swimsuit”

One adult man there spoke up and said he was sorry, that he wasn’t looking at me but if if I thought he was he’s very sorry for the misunderstanding. I told my parents I was going home.

My parents returned an hour or so later and promptly bitched me out for embarrassing them and making the entire party awkward. Did I go to far?",False,False,2020-06-22 20:43:15
AITA for putting my neighbors garbage on her porch because she keeps using my garbage cans?,12703,Not the A-hole,868,f1rkvf,1581376101.0,"I live in a townhome complex with a pretty strict HOA.  I got a new neighbor around six weeks ago. I will call her Elaine. 

Elaine moved in around six weeks ago, and since she moved in I have noticed her putting her trash in my trash can. Elaines trash makes my trash so full that the bin can not close. She sometimes puts her garbage bags next to my bin also. The city will pick this up, but the HOA does not like to see trash bags or open trash cans in front of the house. They will fine you. 

Cost for trash pickup in my city is around $300 a year (25/mo) and it costs around $45 dollars to get a bin if you don’t already have one. 

The first time I saw her doing this, I confronted her. She said that she was waiting for her bin, and she didn’t want her trash to pile up. I said, fine you can put your trash here *for now* but make sure that the can closes. If not you need to hold it. 

A month passes by and Elaine is still using my trash can. I asked her what was going on and she claimed that she could not afford to get a bin right now, and apologized. At this point I have received two notices about my trash cans overflowing. I told her she could no longer put trash in my can. 

Last week, I was off from work. I saw Elaine, again, putting an enormous amount of trash into my trash cans. When she left, I took her trash out of my cans and placed the bags into her porch. 

It turns out that Elaine went out of town. So the trash sat for about a week in front of her door. It was disgusting. I wasn’t home when she returned, but my wife was. My wife says that she came to our house throwing a fit about the garbage. She said she had several notices from HOA and had been fined, and asked why we put disgusting trash in front of her door. She got into a very heated argument with my wife. 

My wife called me up and told me about what happened. She thinks I’m an asshole for the way I handled this situation because now we are not on friendly terms with our neighbor. I just don’t think being on “friendly terms” means that we should be taken advantage of.  She needs to pay for her trash to he collected like everyone else.

AITA for keeping an emergency family iphone secretly hidden in the car my daughter drives so I can always track the location of the car?,12697,Asshole,2465,fclhar,1583221693.0,"Well the cat’s out of the bag on this one, but it doesn’t matter because now I have justification to reinstate previous, more stringent cell phone rules. 

My daughter is 16 and as most 16 year olds, she has her own phone with less parental control. But I still have sensible rules like no turning off iphone tracking, always answer my texts or calls immediately or within a reasonable time frame when not in school or practice, no dead battery excuses. But I know teenagers can be sneaky, so I have a backup tracking plan that I keep secret from her. I have an extra older version iphone on my family plan that I use as an emergency phone. I hide this phone somewhere in the car that I let my daughter drive, kept on silent. It’s always charged so I can track it when my daughter is out. 

This past weekend, my daughter told me she was going to her friend Brett’s house to prepare for an academic competition and an oratory event. When I checked on her iphone and the secret iphone, the locations matched up. She was at her friend’s house. After dinner, I checked again. Curiously, her iphone’s location was at her friend’s house, but my secret iphone was clearly in downtown near all the bars and nightlife. I called my daughter and she told me everything was fine, including the car. 

I drove to my car’s find iphone location to see if maybe it was wrong, and eventually found my car parked along the street near the LGBT night life area. I called Brett’s father (Brett’s parents are divorced and the dad does not live with Brett, and Brett’s mom had the night shift so I called the dad). 

Before Brett’s dad got there, I walked around asking the bouncers at the bars if they had seen my daughter or her friend (I showed them photos). I finally talked to one who remembered turning away my daughter and Brett earlier in the night for trying to use fake IDs. I was livid. I wandered the area and eventually found my daughter and Brett hanging out at a coffee house. I waited for Brett’s dad to park before going in. I asked him what his understanding of the situation was, and he told me as far as his ex told him, the kids were supposed to be at home doing prep work for a oratory competition. 

I told Brett’s dad where I was and he and I walked into the cafe together to retrieve our kids. After we returned home, my daughter confessed to trying to sneak into a gay club with Brett, who apparently is closeted to his parents and school. She was most upset that I outed Brett to his parents this way. But she has not given me any reason to trust her or her friend Brett given their behavior this weekend. 

Stricter rules are on the way. She continues to think I am the biggest villain in her entire world but really, if I hadn’t installed an emergency phone in the car, I wouldn’t have known the shenanigans these two were up to under the guise of studying.

AITA for getting annoyed that my wife bought a metric fuckton of stuff prepping for the corona virus?,12694,Not the A-hole,2156,ffgwib,1583721843.0,"So my wife is a little bit of a nutball when it comes to world disasters. She’s always thinking that the next problem is going to be Armageddon.

This weekend my wife went out and bought like an entire store shelf’s worth of paper towels and toilet paper, like 50 cans of beans and tuna and chef Boyardee. As well as 10 cases of bottled water. I’m not sure where she plans to put this stuff since our apartment isn’t really that big(well it’s big for our area but it’s still a two bedroom, not a house). 

I told her she went overboard and we’d already talked about not wasting money on ridiculous preparations. We’re never going to eat 50 cans of beans and I think I’ve had chef boyardee once in the last year. She’s not in any of the risk groups for the virus, she’s a young, healthy adult woman with no pre existing conditions. 

She got super pissed off and said that she’s just planning ahead and it doesn’t hurt to be prepared. I asked where she was going to put all the shit she bought and she said she’d find a spot. 

I told her she’s being ridiculous and there was no reason to buy this much and she yelled at me.

UPDATE: AITA for wanting to share the hotel room I booked with my girlfriend rather than sleeping with my friend who will go through a break up before our planned trip?,12679,Update,173,d3fl4p,1568356064.0,"Sorry for being a savager, here's the link: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bdrxjd/aita_for_wanting_to_share_the_hotel_room_i_booked/

Hello, its been a few months since my last post but I thought that I'd give you an update. So, naturally, I talked to my SO the day after I posted this on the subreddit. She recently joined this subreddit so she'll probably recognise this post (if you see this, I love you very much <3). 

I expressed my concerns for the break up and how it would affect our vacation together, specifically the room arrangements and told her of my conversation with my friend. She basically said what you guys did: We have no obligation to rearrange our trip for their comfort if they're going to break up, so I shouldnt feel obligated to give up our room together for that. They, especially my friend, has the responsibility to work out something. We agreed that it's a weird situation overall, but with her support I felt even more confident.

Well, my friend and his gf broke up as expected a few weeks after I made the post. I casually confronted my friend some time afterwards. Like, ""oh by the way when we talked about you wanting to change the room arrangements. We're not really up for that, so if you can find another option then that'd be swell."" More or less. He took it well and said he understood of course, but his gf ultimately wouldn't be joining us even though all of us said she was welcome to do so and that she could find another room or hotel but it was her choice. We all agreed that it was his responsibility to find another person to join us if he didn't want to pay that much. He took responsibility for it which I really appreciated, but in the end he had to pay the full price. She still had to pay for the plane ticket and the activities we were supposed to go on, but she said it was easy to earn back and didn't hold a grudge. We're still very good friends to this day.

Overall, we had a good time on our trip. Although our friend was  single and wanted to explore the night life more, me and my partner enjoyed our time together in our hotel room and the public areas, we had a blast! We also connected a bit more with my friend over drinks and fun days. So everything turned out alright in the end. Thank you for all the responses that made me realize that I need to work on my confrontation skills and express my boundaries for my own, and my partner's, interests. I'm hoping that this post will encourage others in my shoes to do the same and hopefully come to a solution as friends and adults. Be respectful, understanding, and don't forget that we all have issues that we struggle with. Best is to encourage growth to strengthen ourselves and our relationships.",False,1568371274.0,2019-09-12 23:27:44
AITA for getting engaged right after my sister?,12657,Not the A-hole,875,fz8fxi,1586650256.0,"So my younger sister (19) got engaged to her boyfriend on February 20th. This came as a shock to my whole family because they were only dating about two weeks. That event alone caused a lot of drama and my sister was very upset about the lack of support and excitement. I tried being there for her and gave her a gentle nudge to maybe have a long engagement. Now just last week my (24f) boyfriend (25m) of three years proposed. We waited until last night to tell all of our family members over FaceTime and oh man did shit hit the fan. My sister was livid and accused me of trying to take the spotlight away from her. She claimed her boyfriend obviously loved her more since he proposed before mine and that I was just jealous. She was also pissed at my family for being more supportive of my engagement and was posting all over social media about having toxic family. I guess I didn’t really think about how close our announcements were so I can kind of see her point but I wasn’t thinking how she thinks I was. My fiancé and I have been talking about marriage for a year now and apparently he’s had the ring for months.

AITA? Or maybe just insensitive?

Edit: wow I am very surprised at all of these comments and I am very thankful for all of your feedback. I’ve been trying to keep up with questions and just wanted to address some things here:
-I have not met her boyfriend
-she is not pregnant (I took her to get an IUD when she turned 18 and I’m sure she hasn’t removed it)
- this is not a troll post, I know it is a pretty crazy scenario 
- I do not think me and my fiancé are too young to get married (had a few comments saying we were??) 
- my family is not Mormon lol 
- I will reach out to her and explain that it wasn’t my intention to take from her special moment. 
-I will be definitely keeping an eye on my future   BIL

AITA for telling my son that his mother cheated?,12651,Not the A-hole,2791,eaf9lv,1576326776.0,"Throw away.
My son is 14. Soon to be ex wife and I were married for almost 20 years.
Recently found out she had been having an affair with co-worker. We are getting a divorce, they are officially dating.
I’m crashing at a buddy’s place while I look for an apartment. 
My son is torn up about it, and he’s confused. On our last visit he kept asking me questions like, if I still loved his mom, why I didn’t think she was attractive, basically trying to figure out what happened. So, I told him. I told him that his mom had an affair, and that’s why out marriage is ending. He put two and two together and realized that moms current boyfriend may be the culprit. 
He has been a nightmare at home ever since. Cursing, and screaming at his mother and being defiant. She doesn’t want to put up with him. I told her what I told him, and she was very upset. She thinks I’m a huge asshole, but I don’t want to lie to my son. I’m willing to take him after I find a place. My buddy also thinks it was an asshole move, and I’m very disappointed with the way that he is acting, I didn’t expect it. Was i an asshole for this? It’s been tearing me up, wondering if I did the right thing.

AITA for brushing out the curls on my biracial daughter?,12638,Not the A-hole,2341,dvtnxa,1573689157.0,"edited to add- to the people out there with curly hair, i hear you and i understand! However, my daughter is 4. My husband and i both have worked hard to figure out how to care for her hair. He does play an active role in coming up with what she needs and i execute it. If i was willing to fight her tooth and nail every morning, i could style it into pretty curls, sure. But it is not worth it to me or my husband to do that to her because she hates it so much and we are not willing to override her bodily  autonomy just to make her hair look nice. It's just hair. What i'm doing is just getting the over-night matted rat's nest out. She does NOT have course hair. It is fine and smooth like mine and it because a matted mess just like mine, it can't be braided or put in a protective style, unfortunately. that will just rip her hair out. not that she would tolerate that, anyway. She removes anything or any style i've ever tried to do in her hair. even if she cooperates while i'm doing it, 5 minutes later, she'll just pull out whatever i put in. from french braids to hair clips and headbands. they're all a no-go.
My husband and i have put a lot of time and effort into finding out exactly how to best care for her hair, and this is really it for now. It's not the best for her HAIR but it is the best for her well being, as we've decided as her parents. We'll revisit her hair care when she's older, i promise. And i would NEVER use heat treatments on a child. i don't care if it curls or not. We just want her to look half groomed.


--------------------------------
So I am white my husband is black and we have two daughters, ages 2 and 4. My 4 year old looks a lot like her (very handsome, if I might add) daddy. But she's got my texture hair with a massive amounts of curls that I usually am the one to take care of. Yesterday I brushed her hair in to a ponytail and put her in an old, very dated (but cute for the time!) outfit from when I was a kid in the 90's and recreated a photo of me when I was her age. I thought it was adorable but I received a lot of backlash from my ""woke"" friends and family (on my side, for the record. I'm not close to his family and they all just ""heart"" any pictures of my kids and rarely comment, if they do just to say they like the picture) accusing me of trying to make her ""white"". 

I've had underhanded comments before from them about ""erasing my kid's identity"" for brushing her hair? She's a child. To maintain her curls to look good requires quite a bit of time and products. Often she just lets me brush the rat's nest out of it and calls it a day. Any time I style it, she sticks her hands in it and messes it up. What else can I do? However, doing this does brush the curls out until her hair gets wet again. She HATES having her hair misted or dampeded and it's too cold for that now anyway. My husband doesn't care. He's happy she's clean and fed. 

To wrap this up, I've had more than one person say I need to leave my more ""black-passing"" child's image alone and let her embrace being black, especially because, get this, my 2 year old is more ""white-passing"" with wavy light hair and my blue eyes. Including what I feel is dangerous advice to let her play outside without sunscreen. We have no idea what her sun tolerance is and I'm not about to deal with a small child having a sunburn I gave her on purpose. I have a low sun tolerance and don't tan, just burn like a boiled lobster. 

I'm going to be honest, this all blows my mind a little bit. My husband has never said anything of the sort. I've asked him about it and he said I don't need to worry about it. I don't let these people anywhere near my kids in person and some of them I can't avoid or just cut off. So am I being an asshole?",False,1573665615.0,2019-11-13 15:52:37

So Carpenter pulls me into a conversation I don’t really want to have at the party. I told him about college apps and going to Cape Cod this summer with my friends. He commented “oh, God hasn’t burned that place down or thrown it into the ocean yet?” I was super mad so I responded, “Guess I didn’t notice, I was too busy having sex with other girls!” I apparently was really loud, because a lot of people looked over. My Dad immediately ran up and started doing damage control mostly “ohhh teenagers say the darndest things lol how silly!!!” But both Carpenter and his wife were mad at the “disrespect” and left.

AITA for pulling a harmless prank on a guy who has a crush on me?,12642,Asshole,2020,fe1npt,1583469524.0,"This actually happened on Valentine’s day but I’m still getting shit for it. Please tell me if I’m TA. 

I’m really good friends with this guy (we’re both 20) and we pull little pranks on each other all the time. We both started working at the same place so we see each other a lot more. 

Around early February we were hanging out one night and he got very drunk (he normally doesn’t get that drunk). He started awkwardly confessing his crush and telling me how much I mean to him etc. I thought he was just messing around but he said the same things  the next day fully sober. I told him that I’m not interested and he didn’t look very upset. He actually took it very well and we talked about something else afterwards. (Fyi - all of my friends said that he was seriously upset about the rejection but that wasn’t my experience). 

On Valentine’s Day we were on our lunch break and I told him that we needed to talk.I told him that I really thought about his confession the other night and wanted to tell him something important since it’s Vday. He panicked and asked if I’m serious. I said yeah and asked if he wants a kiss. EVERYBODY knows that it’s the oldest and lamest trick in the world. But he fell for it HARD and got soooo excited. He was actually about to kiss me  but then I pulled a Hershey’s Kiss chocolate out my pocket and offered it. At first he didn’t get it but then he understood. He didn’t speak to me for the rest of our shift. I told him to lighten up but he straight up ignored me. When we texted later that night he was giving me 1 word answers. I personally think that’s an overreaction. 

After that day he stopped hanging out with our friend group and barely texted anybody. Two weeks went by and our friends got really concerned. I told them about the incident and they started roasting me hard. I have never received so much shit for something so little. They all agreed that I’m an asshole and shattered his confidence. I’m not sure if I agree. First of all, we prank each other frequently. He knows that I’m not serious about anything 99% of the time. Secondly, how could you fall for the Hershey’s Kiss line? 

My friends still bring it up occasionally and say that I’m horrible for what I did. He hasn’t talked to me at all since that day. I’m pretty sure he forgot about it by now.  So am I the bad guy?",True,False,2020-03-05 20:38:44
AITA or telling my boyfriend we cant have dogs if they aren't raised to my standards?,12625,Not the A-hole,1488,fw945t,1586243229.0,"My boyfriend and I do not live together but we want to. He has told me that he wants dogs, specifically Husky's and German Shepherds. I am on board with this but I want them to be raised to my standards. He wants them to be like his grandparent's dogs (he lives with them) but I would want them to be kind of like my parent's dogs.

His grandparents' dogs jump, bark all the time, Beg, are not spayed, nails aren't cut (So they constantly cut his younger siblings), never get exercised, and they always have food in their bowl.

my dogs at home do not jump up unless invited up, nails are always cut, are fixed, Get fed at the same time every day (7:30 am and 7:30 pm. it helps keep them at a healthy weight), They beg but stop when told no, barely ever bark and when they do they stop when told to, and get plenty of exercise.

I also tell him our dogs will not be overweight as that means an unhealthy dog and can lead to health problems, especially since he wants bigger dogs.

He always says I'm crazy when I tell him this and he has even called me an asshole for it, telling me we should not be so strict with dogs since they act how they want to. So AITA for setting these rules or am I okay?

&#x200B;

Edit: So I also forgot to mention that he doesn't believe in putting a dog down. they had this smaller dog who had gigantic tumors all over her body, she was blind, and was in severe pain. they refused to put her down until she kept going to the bathroom in the house.  She would end up getting stuck on her side in the middle of the night and howl and bark to be picked up and straightened out. He thinks that it's cruel to put an animal down but I'm trying to change his mind n=on that by explaining why it's the right thing to do sometimes.

I have been talking to him about it. and He is starting to see why his dog's behavior is not okay, but some things like the barking he doesn't understand why that's bad. He's a good man and the only reason he acts this way is because of how he was raised. he was raised to not accept people for who they are (I'm fixing that), that dogs do what they want and it doesn't matter if they injure someone (I've been deeply scratched by their nails), that living in a dirty area is okay, etc. I was raised that all creatures are equal, to live in a clean environment, and accept everyone. we are fixing the issues his upbringing has caused, so he is getting better.

AITA for taking my autistic sister to see monster trucks?,12608,Not the A-hole,1124,flr1bs,1584718885.0,"I have a severely autistic sister (10 years old). She is nonverbal and really just plays in her own world. 

She goes through a lot of ""toy"" phases where she'll just obsess over a few toys at a time. Right now, it's monster trucks (and kinetic sand) and we've amassed an entire collection of toy trucks for her over the past two or three years. We don't take her outside often because she experiences sensory overload easily. 

Anyways we thought it'd be great to bring her to a big monster truck show since it was in town (this was back in Jan) and the tickets were pretty cheap. We got her some light ear plugs and topped her off with ear muffs because loud noises is what overloads her senses the most. She absolutely loved the show, she smiled throughout the entire thing and she was on her best behavior.

Except she was in her own world, for a lack of better words. She was flailing her arms around a lot, saying a lot of gibberish, making interesting facial expressions. She wasn't being loud or running around, she was just being *weird*, to quote. I guess people were off put by it because a man  told me that I shouldn't have brought my sister to the show. 

I asked If there was a problem and he said that my sister was being a disturbance, she was distracting from the show,  being weird, etc.  I was pretty disheartened by it but we still stayed to watch the show until the very end.

AITA for not kicking out my daughter's ex boyfriend?,12584,Not the A-hole,947,g57uwt,1587469019.0,"Hello all,

I've found myself in a bit of a sticky situation amidst everything going on in the world. My daughter (19) moved back in from college and asked if her high-school boyfriend (18) could move back into the house. His Mother is immunocompromised and also probably abusive (no father in the picture). Reluctant, but convinced by my wife, I decided to let him sleep in the guest room for the time being.

He's been very well behaved, makes his bed every day, is very polite, does chores around the house and tries to pay us back for every little thing. He even cut my younger son's hair (he worked part-time at a barbershop) and plays sports / hangs out with them. Fast forward four weeks later, and apparently, him and my daughter had a big fight Saturday night and broke up. I think they've just seen a little too much of each other recently as they've been the only people they've really interacted with and been hanging out at least 10 hours every day.

My daughter came to me sobbing and asking me to kick him out of the house because she couldn't stand being cooped up with him because she was heartbroken. I talked to him about it and he said he doesn't have anywhere else to go (his mother is his only relative locally) and he begged me to not kick him out. To compromise, I told him he could sleep in our pool house, a completely separate building, for the time being. My wife came to me furious and said it was absurd that I would take a random kids side over my own daughters, to which I responded that I wasn't picking a side. I just feel I have a responsibility to make sure this kid had a stable roof over his head. She said my daughter is just crushed to even see him and hear him playing with my son.

My view is that she would be looking at pictures/reminded of him even if he was in the house, and there's no real good reason to kick him out. AITA?

Edit to add: I did know the boyfriend's father from my days in high school, and he was a real piece of work. It maybe adds something to why I feel partly responsible for the kid. ",False,1587440337.0,2020-04-21 04:36:59

I had insomnia my entire life, took perscribed Ambien from 15 to till I got pregnant with my daughter at 20. Since I am a single mom, I can't be incapacitated by Ambien so I get around 3-4 hours a night and exist on coffee and the idea that I can sleep when she's 18. Unfortunately she's inherited my sleep issues. I've tried everything, she doesn't have screen time, has never had caffeine, limit sugar (even natural like fruit) after 5 pm, use lavender, and a sleep routine. No luck. I talk to her pediatrician who says I should try a small amount of melatonin. Since I started giving her melatonin she's been getting 9 hours versus 4 hours before. My 5 year old doesn't have dark circles under her eyes and her behavior and performance in preschool has improved. 

Problem is her father (29M), he lost all physical and legal custody but still has visitation. Her bedroom at her dad's has a TV, she shares it with her 2 year old sister who screams and stays up till 2 am and sleeps in till noon, and her dad and I don't have a stellar co-parenting relationship. He blames me for losing custody but in reality he let her insurance lapse 3 times and she developed stage 1 bedsores on his watch due to neglect. 

Daughter told him she takes her sleep gummy at mommy's and then she can sleep. He calls me screaming that I had no right to drug his child. I said I do since I have legal custody and it was in her best interest.. he opened a CPS case against me and says is making a play for legal custody. Doesn't want physical or even more visitation just wants the right to make decisions I'll pay for. He's over $8k in arrears and wants to eat that away.

If I have friends over, he'll watch from the porch and out the windows. He'll comment later on how many people I have over, how late I have them over, etc. Like complaining I had a party of 7 over till 1 am.

If my grass gets too long, he'll comment on how I need to spend a day a week mowing; I can't keep ""going out 3 nights in a row"" 

If there are cars parked in the street, he'll know which ones are friends there to see me. I know he knows because he goes right to mine and asks me to have my friends move their cars.

If I BBQ he'll complain about the smoke smells, and how nobody needs to be barbecuing for 3 hours.

Overall, I can tell by the stuff he says that he's watching me and my house wayyy more than anyone has any right to. Knowing when I'm there or not, who's there with me, how long, etc. I've never noticed stuff like that about my neighbors, I mind my business. 

Anyway, it's kind of uncomfortable. I've tried to be accommodating, ""Ok, I'll move the cars. OK I'll be done barbecuing soon."" I've also tried to ask for more privacy in the weirder conversations. ""My friends and I don't really like it when someone's watching our comings and goings; would you drop this?"" But I honestly I'm getting pretty bothered by it.

So this time, when he mentioned I need to move my trash cans inside sooner after the garbage truck comes; I told him off.

I said ""I want you to know, I really don't like being watched like this. It bothers me."" 

He acted confused.

I said ""Look, I'm a woman living alone and it's kind of unsettling"" 

He acted confused still, and kind of defensive.

I said ""You're a father of two daughters. Think about if they came to you and said that a man they didn't know or like was watching to see when they're home or not, which of the other girls are their little friends, remembering which bikes their little friends ride and recognizing them on sight.. Watching when they're out in the yard, and what they're doing there. Think of how you'd feel.""

He got upset at what I said and was saying ""That's different!!"" 

I was like ""It's NOT different. That's how I feel. I'm asking you to empathize here, to understand how it feels to be watched 24/7 and not be OK with it! How that seems to have made you feel is exactly how I feel!"" 

After that argument, he stormed off and has seemed to leave me alone for a few days. But I'm wondering if I crossed a line, what I said seemed to make him really angry but I didn't know how else to get him to understand.

The closest approximate color I can give to you is if you search ""black cherry hair"" and imagine it a little more purple. At 34, I'm not exactly new to the job force. One of my biggest stipulations for a job is that I fit in as I am, and that I don't work for a company that's so uppity my hair would be an issue.

I've never had a problem until now. I'm like 40% satisfied with my current job, and have been seeking something new. I've been on a few interviews to test the waters, and it's been pretty great so far. Until a week ago, when I ended up going to an interview at a company that's got a much different atmosphere than I expected from the phone interview and all that. 

The woman doing the interview kept staring at my hair with a look of disgust. A few others did the same. It was very obvious I was not an, ahem, culture fit. No biggie, you're not always going to be, you know? So I just shrugged it off and finished the interview. 

A day later, they called to let me know I hadn't gotten the job. I was polite and cordial on the phone. But the woman was very aggressive and downright bitchy to me, and said ""And for the record, just a piece of advice for you in the future? Showing up to a professional interview with clownish hair is not going to get you very far.""

I said, ""I think my 15 years in the X industry with an exemplary track record says otherwise. But thank you for letting me know that I was correct in understanding the company is not a good culture fit for me.""

She snorted in that haughty-bitch way, and said, ""Well, it obviously doesn't say that much, otherwise you wouldn't be interviewing for a job.""

AITA for potentially missing my wife’s birth because of the funeral of my sibling?,12518,No A-holes here,3619,exzcsy,1580723525.0,"Throwaway.

About a week ago my twin sister passed away suddenly. I don’t want to go into the details but I am completely devastated by grief; I loved her more than anything else in this world. Even though I rarely got to see her in person we FT’d a few times a week and We were very very very close.

On the other hand I am not close at all with my parents, who are in charge of planning the funeral which is scheduled for a weekend that is a few days before my wife’s due date and will be taking place in our hometown which is about a 3 hour drive from where I live. I pleaded and pleaded with them to change the date but they’ve already paid and set down the non refundable deposit and apparently it’s the best time for all of our extended family who had to coordinate with time off and other things - so there’s nothing I can do in terms of getting it rescheduled. Wife cannot come because she’s been ordered to move as little as possible by her OB.

I tentatively brought this up with my wife and she didn’t even give me a chance to explore all the possibilities, she just straight up said hell no and she said that this would damage her trust in me because i won’t be there when she needs me the most which I understand but I cannot comprehend how she expects me to miss this. I just can’t.

I want to fly there the night before the funeral and then fly back the morning after or the night of. If anything does happen I can reschedule the flight or leave immediately but she’ll be in good hands because she’s got her family to take care of her while I’m gone and I’ll be on FaceTime with her whenever I can.

Today I brought it up again and I tried to be sympathetic with her but she still refused to budge. I then told her that I understand her position but that this is the last chance I’ll get to say goodbye to my twin and there is zero chance of me missing that, absent a catastrophic event. She accused me of abandoning her and she’s been ignoring me and acting cold to me

AITA?

Edit: to be specific: the funeral is 4 days before her due date.

Edit 2: just to clarify a few things - her complications are that if she moves around too quickly then she gets nauseous. She’s not on bed rest per se, just been instructed to kind of chill out if you know what I mean.

The funeral is scheduled for 12 noon on the day so I am perfectly fine with leaving around 8:30 then returning home whenever it is finished - so probably be back by 5, 6 at the latest. I have no plans to attend the reception and if for whatever reason I do then it won’t be very long.

Her family already does a heck of a lot for us, her mother Visits frequently when I’m at work or out of the house and her sister spends a lot of time with her. I asked them if they’d be willing to take care of her in my absence and they said that they’d be glad to do it.

Lastly because some people have gotten a bit confused as to my wording, I originally said drive there but then I thought about it and there’s flights Going from my city to my hometown, 9 departures on that day. So I thought it would be better to fly because the flight is 30 minutes so I’d be away from my wife for less time but some commenters have said it’d be better to drive in case something happens and I think they’re right. Some people have also criticized me about saying it’s “my wife’s birth” and she has been furious with me for saying “we’re pregnant” or sometimes “my child” because she prefers me to say “she’s pregnant” and “our child” or even “her child”.",False,1580719335.0,2020-02-03 01:52:05
AITA for allowing my 8 year old daughter shave her head?,12503,Not the A-hole,1181,g43da4,1587308884.0,"So this past week my 8 year old daughter has been begging me to shave her head. This just started after her 17 year old cousin did it. I've always considered myself a supportive mom and let my kids do whatever they want (within reason of course) 

She had extremely long, blonde, gorgeous hair just like I do. She was fully aware that I was going to support her decision, school was cancelled for the rest of the year and she won't go back to school until August (possibly September) so her hair will have time to grow out.

So last night, I got out my husband's clippers and shaved her head for her. She smiled the whole time and loved the end result.  

The next day, I took a photo to send to my mom and only my mom. My mom decided to forward it to a bunch of other family members, who got back to me. 90% of them agree that I'm the asshole for not saying no to her and setting limits for her, and also told me that I'm setting her up for bullying.

Here's the thing - it's literally her hair will grow back. She knows. I asked her if she regretted it and she is extremely happy that she did it. As for bullying, she knows how to stand up for herself and that hair doesn't define her beauty.

My son is on the autism spectrum, but is very high functioning. Lately he’s been very mean, mostly to his younger sister. It’s been going on for a few months, and we’ve talked about it with his therapist, discussed it alone with him, giving him a lot of 1 on 1 time, we’ve tried everything thinking maybe it’s because he’s jealous of no longer being the baby. This morning I heard my 7 year old crying bloody murder and when I went upstairs to her bedroom I see my son with scissors and my daughters costume that we made together as a project was all cut up to pieces. 

I comforted my daughter, made him apologize and brought him downstairs. My husband and I asked him why he would do that and he said “It was ugly and I didn’t like it.” I told him that was the meanest thing he’s done, and that he’s grounded and can’t go trick or treating. He completely freaked out, had a tantrum, kicked and screamed and we just put a pillow under his head until he stopped and got our other kids ready for school. 

While we were getting the girls ready, I guess he called my mother and told her that we weren’t letting him go trick or treating and she called me yelling about how could I do that to our child and he has autism and he didn’t know what he was doing. 

My husband thinks maybe we also over reacted and we should let him earn the chance to go trick or treating but he completely destroyed his sisters costume and that’s not something we can brush off. 


AITA for not budging?


Edit: my husband and I have decided he will not be trick or treating. He has shown no remorse throughout the day. We are going to discuss this with his therapist when we see her later today, but this malicious behavior is not going to be tolerated and I will not coddle my son to be a shitty person and man.

AITA for letting a dementia patient add me to her will?,12478,Not the A-hole,1490,cxsymc,1567263823.0,"I was part of a meals on wheels program for community service in high school and met this wonderfully sweet old woman who didn’t have any family nearby. 

We had a lot in common, I had been considering a career in social work, she didn’t have any family nearby, and I didn’t have any living grandmothers so we became fast friends. 

She developed dementia and towards the end I basically moved in with her and cared for her in exchange for free rent in her home and groceries. (It was also out of my love for her, but I couldn’t have afforded to care for her full time if I also had to make rent.) 

She died and it was heartbreaking but I also saw firsthand how she was suffering in the final days, so it was bittersweet. 

She divided her will among her children and I equally. I did not ask her to do this, I never asked her about the contents of her will and the one time we briefly discussed it all we discussed was the house, not her savings. 

She left me 80k and change, and the same amount to her two children. A remarkable gesture and life changing for me, obviously. 

Her children are contesting the will because she apparently added me in around the same time her dementia began to rear it’s ugly head. They insist she was confused and had mistakenly come to believe I was one of her children and that even if she hadn’t mistaken me to be one of her children, that she was not in her right mind when she did this so the will should be invalid. 

I am very conflicted as to my responsibility here.  I would obviously very much like to keep the money but I don’t want to let how life changing the money would be cloud my judgment. I don’t need it so badly that it would be worth doing wrong by her or her kids.

On our was back our bus driver was a young man, probably in his mid-twenties. One stop after we got on two young men, also mid-twenties, got on who clearly were very good friends with the bus driver.


After a few stops the bus driver asked us where we wanted to get off, we told him our stop and then he got back to talking to his friends.

Then something strange happened: The bus got off its official route. At first we didn't notice but after some time we realized this wasn't the way back to our hotel. After some time the bus stopped in the middle of nowhere right in front of a house, no official bus stop im sight. The first friend got off.

Then we realized the bus driver was driving his friends home. My mom asked him if he was still driving us to our hotel(bus stop), the driver assured us that this was the right bus.

We then proceeded to actually head in the right direction back to our hotel but then we again took the ""wrong"" turn and the driver dropped his second friend off at his house.

After that he finally drove us to our hotel, this time our bus ride took 40 instead of the previous 20 minutes. We were furious. Clearly, the bus driver thought that we as tourists wouldn't notice the detour.

So now we are debating on whether or not we should call the boss/manager of the bus company. So WIBTA if i complained? Or would that be too much of a Karen move?

AITA for winning a cosplay contest with the help of fake boobs?,12437,Not the A-hole,1096,f9if6n,1582698047.0,"I (22f) am a cosplayer. I dress up for fun as anime characters and I've been doing that for five years now. I'm not a pro or anything, but I've learned how to sew, make foam armor, that sort of stuff, I'm sorta competent at it right now.

A local anime convention near my town was having a cosplay contest. All you had to do was have your pic taken during the event and sent before their deadline and people would vote on them on Facebook. It was sort of informal and the prize was only a few gift cards so it wasn't a big deal. I don't have much of an online presence so I didn't think I would have a chance, but I decided to give it a shot anyway since I've been building a certain armor for a while and I thought it looked good. Without getting into the details, it's a warrior that happens to have an ample cleavage window. (yeah, I know, but I still love her)

After voting had started, I was surprised at the positive feedback I was receiving. Some comments said I looked fierce, my wig was fantastic, my armor looked real, etc. A few of the comments also pointed out how I was ""really doing the character justice"" because of the size of my breasts, some more crudely worded than others. I left a like on all the replies since any praise was good. The only issue is: I'm flat as a board.

Underneath my armor, I was wearing what is quite literally a breastplate made out of silicon that gives me (in the words of a friend) some serious boobage. The armor had a neckpiece and shoulderpads, so the seams were perfectly hidden. Since the character's cleavage is sorta diamond-shaped, there's even underboob on display so it doesn't look like I'm just padding out a bra, it looks like the real deal.

A week goes by and I get a notification on facebook. Apparently I won the contest. I was ecstatic, it was the first time my ""work"" had been recognized like that. I messaged some friends, they were all happy for me. I was reading the comments and one of them stuck out, saying he wasn't surprised I had won considering my body. So I decided to be snarky and reply with ""Well, if all that's needed to win a contest are boobs, here's where I bought mine!"" and linked the silicon breasts I was using.

And apparently that was a mistake, since I got a few rude comments on that reply, some saying I was fooling people, some a bit more nasty saying I was just using a fake body just to get ahead of ""real cosplayers"". A few people even left mean comments on my facebook and instagram for that. I took a break from social media because they were being a pain in the ass.

I told friends about what happened and some of them said I might have been the asshole for being snarky like that and I should have just accepted the prize and moved on, but I feel like this situation has escalated way too far. It even soured my mood towards that specific cosplay even though it's probably my best work so far. AITA?

UPDATE: Thank you all very much for all the love, I wasn't expecting this to blow up like this but I'm glad to know I was snarky but a bit justified. Knowing there are more people out there who bust their ass in complex costumes does make me feel better about my boobage.

My girlfriend tells me I'm being too nice and I shouldn't forgive him so easily. I thought about it and decided she’s right and I should teach him a lesson. I waited til our next session. He looked nervous when he saw me but I just acted like everything was normal. I waited til everyone got there then briefly excused myself. As I was walking back, I sent a screenshot of my and Josh' text convo. I covered his weiner with eyeroll emojis. Immediate chaos. Josh went white as a sheet and everyone was shouting. He was stammering trying to explain but the store owner came over and yells above the noise and asked what the hell was going on. Everyone looks at Josh but he’s frozen so I hand her my phone to see. She looks and just tells Josh he’s fired and to get the fuck out of her store. He bolts and the owner hands me my phone and walks away.

It was really awkward after that. We all kind of gathered our stuff and made halfhearted plans to start a new campaign and left. Group chat was dead, but two of the other players have texted me individually and expressed that they were mad cause I ruined the game and I should have addressed it with him privately instead of embarrassing him and getting him fired. I just didn't respond, but it did get me thinking I maybe could have handled that better. AITA?

AITA for making a petty comment about a rude joke some baby boomer made to a waitress?,12392,Asshole,1345,dl2zfm,1571703987.0,"I was at a diner this morning, eating alone because I'm traveling for work. It was absolutely packed and there was a family at the table next to me. Two college girls and their parents, it looked like.

The waitress came by their table and asked if they wanted coffee or water refills and the mom asked for more of both for everyone. Kind of rudely, I thought. The dad made some joke about how it's amazing how coffee just shows up, it must be magic or elves. 

Yeah it was about as awkward as it sounds. 

She came by my table and asked if I needed anything, and I asked for maple syrup, but ""no rush, because it's mad busy here and it's not like you've got magical elves or some shit helping you out"" 

I know the family next to me heard because the daughters started laughing about it, and the dad was glaring daggers at me when I ate my breakfast.

AITA for going to sleep in the woods when the baby cries?,12376,Not the A-hole,1421,emch4u,1578618120.0,"I'm in high school, my dad is in his 50s and my stepmom is in her 30s. (Yeah it's as weird as it sounds) They have an infant son who cries all the time. Kinda sucks because I'm really stressed about school, this year is really important for my college admissions.

I'm really into camping and the outdoors. Making forest shelters by hand with stuff I find in the woods, camping, hiking, etc. (Like the primitive technology YouTube channel, but not as good lol). I've been camping and backpacking ever since I was little, with my mom.

My dad's house is on a lot of land and I've made a bunch of forest shelters out there, over the years, it's a hobby of mine. I know it's weird, but it's fun and relaxing. In the past, my dad had never had issues with me camping out there to test them out, or whatever.

Anyway, I hadn't been getting much sleep at all with my halfbrother and stepmom here. He cries all day and night, and she's an early waker who makes a racket first thing in the morning.

So thr last few months I've been camping more and more. It's cold but I have a really good subzero sleeping bag, i can make a fire, I'm comfortable. And I sleep like a log; I've always slept well in the woods and it's a whole lot better than trying to sleep in the noisy house.

It's causing such a fuss for no reason, my dad is saying he doesn't like the idea of me sleeping out there alone in the winter, and I said to him that he never had a problem with it before, he's been letting me do it for years alone and it's always been OK, it's not fair for him to take it back because he's probably mad I'm the only one getting any sleep.

My stepmom says it's disrespectful, my dad puts a roof over our heads and I go to sleep in my little forts every night? That it's like what a child would do, not a young lady. 

They haven't stopped me yet but I'm worried they will. I also don't see at all how I've done anything disrespectful but maybe there's just something I'm not getting?

AITA for not taking my buddy’s side in a breakup?,12365,Not the A-hole,1830,fo8ol5,1585098343.0,"My buddy (let’s call him Ben) and his girlfriend of 2 years just broke up. They got into an argument after she informed him that she stopped taking birth control. Ben said that she “blindsided” him with this information, and that he “can’t stay hard with condoms on”, so it will ruin their sex life. But what got him most mad was that she decided to stop taking birth control without talking it over with him, and she can’t be making huge decisions like that on her own without consulting him. She did not like how mad he got about it and it turned into an extremely ugly argument that ended with her breaking up with him.  

Ben was devastated and wanted a few guys and me to meet him at his bar. He told the story and all of my buddies were on his side. I was kinda shocked. I told him that it sucks he got dumped and i felt bad but at the same time he was in the wrong here. I went on about how taking birth control is totally up to her, and he can be “bummed” by the decision because sex without condoms is way better, but if she doesn’t want to take birth control, it’s her choice. I have a wife and lots of female friends, and I’ve heard countless rants on why birth control sucks and taking it can be a nuisance. It’s not like she told him about it mid sex, she told him right away. Then i said, half jokingly although it’s kind of accurate, “i love you man, but that was toxic af” and yes i said it like that to be comically dick. He did not like my response and said I was being an asshole. My one friend took me to the side and said that “this is no time to act woke, and that a bro always takes the bro’s side in a breakup”. It’s not like I plan on being friends with her and ditching my friend. I’m still gonna be friends with him, I just now know he has some warped opinions on birth control etiquette, and can’t hold a boner in condoms. 

But maybe I did pick the wrong time to point out that he was wrong, maybe I should’ve just empathized with him for losing his gf. I kind of feel like I broke the bro code for a trivial reason and I could’ve just said “that sucks” and moved on.

EDIT: I feel I should clarify this because it seems to be something brought up a lot in the comments. She told him the day she stopped, it wasn’t like she hadn’t been taking BC and just told him now, she stopped the day she told him. Guess I should’ve said “she’s stopping taking BC”. Poor wording on my part. Sorry all. 

TLDR: My friend got dumped by his girlfriend after an argument that stemmed from him saying she shouldn’t have stopped taking birth control without consulting him, and i told him that she had a point and he was in the wrong.",False,1585079754.0,2020-03-24 18:05:43

I picked up the medicine and went into the grocery store, trying to get to the checkout as fast as possible. I was really lucky that there was no line and was already unloading my cart when a pregnant women asked me if I could let her in front of me. Normally, I would have said yes but her cart was bursting and I had to catch the next bus. Maggie has a car but I don’t drive it because of insurance issues. I really didn’t want to wait for the next bus because I didn’t want to leave Maggie alone for too long and I really didn’t have that many items. I wouldn’t have gone grocery shopping in the first place but the pharmacy is right next to the store and we really needed a few things. 

I told the lady that my girlfriend was sick at home and I would hurry up packing the groceries into my backpack. The lady started screaming that I shouldn’t treat her like that and that young people nowadays don’t know how to behave. She yelled that she needed to sit down and that I would take to long packing up my things. I ignored her, paid and left. In the moment I felt like I was right, but now I‘m overthinking it.

Two years ago I’d invited all my immediate family, my parents siblings and their kids and my grandparents over for Christmas dinner or after drinks if they had other plans for dinner, everyone agreed that they would come over and would let me know when they’re on their way, cut to 9pm and I hadn’t heard from anyone but my younger cousin who sent me screenshots of everyone in a whatsapp group agreeing that there was no way they were coming over to my “dungeon” to sit and listen to “w*ist sl*shing” music” while eating “lettuce” (we’re a vegan household) so I thought ok cool you’ve all made your choices, I don’t NEED any of you and I won’t be missed so that’s the end of that.

Cut to last summer when I married my husband (27) I didn’t bother inviting any family but my cousin (and my dads sister as she’s always been the mother figure in my life) as we’d always been chill but I told her I understood if she didn’t want to come as I didn’t want to cause tension between her and the goblins so she FaceTimed me for the ceremony. 

Now three weeks ago my family found out I had gotten married, I guess they went to the group chat and realised none of them had been invited so my uncle messaged me “so after everything we’ve done for you you couldn’t even let us know you were getting married” and then carried on calling me a selfish bitch and such, not inviting them was the right choice so I know I’m not the arsehole there but my cousin seems to think I’m the arsehole due to my reply of “stay mad hoes, I wanted the happiest day of my life to be filled with love, love NONE OF YOU have ever shown me.

His ex **HATES** me, strictly for the fact that my boyfriend has moved on and it looks serious between us. She's made it clear that I'm not allowed to be alone with their daughter in any capacity because I'm *not* her Mom and I'm not going to be. She doesn't even like it when it's my BF's weekend and we go out together as a trio for a movie. She's gone as far as saying she'd call the cops if he ever left his daughter with me. \*She does this with ALL the baby daddies.

Around eleven-ish this morning, she starts sending me texts, hitting me up on Messenger, etc--asking me to come get her daughter, and keep her for the day.

Her reasoning? She got invited to a Super Bowl party and the other two boys were with their grandparents, and my BF had to work, so could I get off my ass and come get her? And keep her overnight?

I sent her a screenshot of her first text to me, the 'I'll call the cops!' threat and tell her nope, can't do it.

Thirty minutes later, my BF, his ex, and several of our mutual friends are all blowing up my phone and social media calling me horrible because I won't go pick her up. My BF left me a voicemail that I spent an hour crying over, nobody will talk to me, and I know if I post screenshots they'll just say I should have picked her up and made her feel special we had 'girls time'.

I'm still in pieces over it, I volunteered to go into work just so I won't be home alone crying.

AITA for not taking her up on the offer and spending the day with my BF's daughter?

Edit/Update; Apparently the Ex had posted that her dad had a heart attack and I was refusing to pick up their daughter so she could go to the hospital.

That's why everyone went nuclear.

She has a tendency to be kind of over the top and stretches the truth a lot. We all were hanging out over the weekend to celebrate another friend’s birthday. Apparently a few people had the idea to give her “pot brownies” and see how she’d react. The catch is that they had nothing in them at all. But they were banking on her acting high anyway to fit in with everyone else. 

I didn’t find out about this whole plan until I got there. Everyone else pretended to be high and so did the girl, predictably. I didn’t participate in that part but I also didn’t tell her it was all a huge joke at her expense. 

At the end of the night someone told her and called her out on always being fake. She got really upset and ended up leaving the party early by herself. I do feel bad for her but I also feel like she kind of brings this on herself sometimes because she’s always trying too hard. 

Again though, this wasn’t my prank and I probably wouldn’t have planned something like this myself. But it is what it is now.

I have a big family, I have my mom (F53) my dad (M55) my older twin sisters that are 34, and my younger sister (F19). My sisters both have husbands and kids and my younger sister lives at home and works for the family business. I live in a condo with boyfriend. He’s always been close with my family. Around 2 weeks ago i was ordering post mates on my boyfriends phone and he got a message from my younger sister. I was feeling nosy and opened up their message thread. For 2 months they’ve been hooking up and sending nudes. In that moment i flipped out and took screenshots, i sent them to myself and deleted the evidence. I acted like nothing happened and luckily the next day John was gonna go visit his mom in another state. The next day after he left to drive to his mom i sent them to my mom, my dad and both my other sisters. My whole family was disgusted. That day i left the condo because it’s in his name so i didn’t have any commitment legally to it. Then my sisters husbands helped move me into my parents house. It all happened in a day and when my sister got to my parents house all her stuff was outside the house. She tried coming in and my dad went outside and started screaming at her. My other sisters both went outside and they all yelled at her, and told her that she was a disappointment to the family. My dad fired her on the spot. (My older sisters husband is a lawyer so he gave my dad some legal advice on how to cover himself) He told her to get lost. She was crying and i came outside, i threw the condo keys at her and told her to go move in with my boyfriend since they’re so close. I told her i knew everything. Before she could say anything i went inside. There was some more yelling for about 20 minutes and my dad came in, he said my older sisters had to leave and we watched movies. I sent the screenshots to my boyfriend and blocked him. Over the past two weeks my sister has been trying to contact everyone. She had to be escorted off my parents property 2 times already.

AITA for my beIng angry over a joke and being taken advantage of?,12320,Not the A-hole,902,frs9pl,1585609004.0,"I(38m) have a TBI and I am completely deaf on my right side. My hearing loss/TBI happened later in life and was caused while deployed. So I've always told everyone I interact with please stand on my left side, speak slowly, and clearly so that I can hear you. I help myself as well by turning my ear towards them slightly and focusing on their lips. I can't quite read lips but it helps. 

So I have this roommate we will call F, F is an ok guy for the most part but F likes to fuck with me on occasion. Normally the jokes are alluding to I'm dead because I'm an old man and I joke back with him about it. 

But lately, I've been worried my hearing was getting worse because F always speaks on my good side but I'm catching maybe every couple of words and nothing else. I'll be in the middle of doing something and F will say aren't you going to go do this as I asked you to? And I'll be legitimately confused because I don't recall agreeing but say ok sure. I do legitimately have memory loss issues combined with my hearing problem it was entirely possible I had said yes.

My GF has been sheltering in place with us and last night F came in to ask me a question. Again I was only catching every couple of words when my GF stopped him saying knock it off F that's fucked up. I asked what was fucked up and she tells me F is just moving his lips and not saying anything except those couple of words I am catching. F laughed about it and said he was pissed my GF ruined his joke. Because to top it off he admitted has been evidently using my hearing loss and telling me I agreed to shit during conversations that never took place. 

I will admit I was legitimately angry it's bad enough I can't hear people normally but to exploit it purposefully to mess with me for your own humor is fucked up! I told him all of this but F just laughs about it saying it's not his fault I can't hear or remember things. Besides, it's entertaining for him. I told him he was being a jackass and to fuck off with that bullshit. He said I was being an AH that it wasn't as big a deal as I was making it out to be. But I think it was he exploited my issues for his own gain.

Examples: he's gotten me to buy all the groceries and not contributed saying I agreed to it when I never did. If he had just asked me, in reality, I would have most likely said yes depending on the actual circumstances.

He's gotten me to fix his car for free, again I would have probably done it if he had asked. 

He thinks I'm being an AH who is overreacting and since I would have probably said yes he doesn't see what the problem is. I think I'm not the AH here at all and even if I cursed him out he had it fucking coming.

I'm temporarily living at home and my parents wanted me to give them the spare car keys so they could move the car if it was in the way ever. 

I said OK.

It turns out when I have been out, or not paying attention, they've been lending my car to my sister who is 17 and has a minors driving license. I told them that wasn't OK to have done without asking me, plus I told my sister to stop taking my car out.

I don't like her driving it because I don't have my car insured for a minor driving it, and what if she crashes? Plus, even though I'm hardly going out, I don't like seeing my car missing with no warning randomly.

Anyway, my sister has used my car several times since then. I think my parents let it slide, they know she's doing it even though I don't like it. I asked for my keys back and they said it would be too inconvenient to not have them because we have to double park in our driveway and sometimes cars need to be moved.

So I made a plan. I put an old cellphone in the glovebox, on a charger. And I installed a ""track my child"" sort of app on the phone so I could see where it was going.

So, when I saw my car gone one day, I called my friend who picked me up and we went to where the car was. It was parked in the downtown area of the city on the street. I took it back with my keys and we drove it to my friends house to hide it. Then my friend dropped me off back at home. 

My parents got a call later that day from my sister panicking saying she was stranded in the city, she'd lost the car. They drove out to get her, and they all came home. 

I started asking questions like ""what were you doing with the car"" ""did you lock it?"" ""Are you sure?"" ""Did you misremember where you parked?"" ""You're sure it's stolen?""

And my sister was freaking out, like saying she was sure she locked it and she was sure of where she parked it and it was stolen.

I was like ""Well maybe you know how I feel having my car stolen with no warning all the time!! It sucks, right? You go expecting the car to be somewhere and it's gone?"" 

She was like ""but that's different, it was just me driving, you know the family has keys"" 

And I was like ""You know I have keys, right? I'm sure it will turn up somewhere"" 

My sister and parents realized I had the car by then, and my sister was furious for stranding her in the city at night, for making her think for a long time that the car had been carjacked, etc. 

My parents are also pissed that I didn't think of her safety when I left her without a way home.

(Edit to explain about the safety thing. 

I took the car back in the early afternoon, I didn't expect her to be out till nighttime.

It wasn't a sketchy area, The area was a rich ass neighborhood that's always crawling with cops. There were also gas stations and convenience stores open all night that she could have gone into to wait. 

I'm a young woman myself, I went to college near that area, and I never had any trouble being out there late and alone. Being stuck there would be inconvenient but not really sketchy)

My aunt is not happy with this fact I don't know where she reads things but she is suggesting to me and to my parents to do various things before I die like.



1)Family trip(including her family) to a foreign country to make happy memories. The thing is it will be paid by my parents and I don't want them to spend their hard-earned money on it. We are not that rich and how on earth any parent make an happy memory when they know their kid is going to die.




2)Writing a letter to 40+(all extended) family member. I don't want to spend my time writing a letter to relatives I didn't even meet yet.



3)Spend time with my friends(karting, baseball etc). When I told her I don't have any friends she suggested me to go with her son's friend. I dont want to do that too.




She was really angry when I rejected her every proposal and rambled about I am dying without enjoying life etc. For the next part, I think I am kinda TA she was once charged with drunk driving and has a terrible driving record. I told her she should also write a letter to everyone as knowing her driving she could die before me. She was livid and left quickly. My mother told me I am TA I should have simply refused her help.

Edit: I do have some friends but I am not that close to them. Also, I am not sad for death everyone is going to die sooner or later. What triggered me was her perception of enjoying life.

AITA for telling my employee to clock out if she can’t work due to her self diagnosed anxiety?,12297,Not the A-hole,1240,fkawk1,1584500479.0,"I manage and co-own a company that makes soaps, lotions, etc. We only sell locally and online so we work out of a pretty small warehouse with a store front. I only have 9 employees. 

Since we work in a small warehouse, much of the cleaning duty falls on them. 
Nobody minds it. The only complaint that I get is that about eco friendly products. 
 
We rotate chores so nobody gets stuck doing what they hate. This system has worked out the entire three years we have been open. 

My last hire hates doing any of the cleaning. She has a pattern that I’ve noticed. Any day that requires her to clean bathrooms/take out trash she makes sure to talk about how anxious she is and how her stomach hurts, and she can’t focus. She often ends up laying down or going into a dark room to relax. 

At first I did the stuff for her because I felt bad, but after I noticed what she was doing, I told her she had to trade with one of her coworkers. She usually got someone to do the cleaning for her.

Friday was her day to do the trash and sort out recycling. When I went to go tell her to do it she was already sitting in the dark in our break room. I asked her to go take care of the trash, she said she couldn’t because she was on the verge of a panic attack. I asked her if she asked another coworker to do it, she said none of them agreed to do it. 

I told her that she could take a minute to calm down but she needed to get it done. She said  that there was no way she could do it. I told her to go ahead and clock out then. She asked me why, and said that she had 5 hours left in the day. 

I told her to clock out if she can’t do her job. She got very angry and said that I had to provide reasonable accommodations for her disability. I told her that self diagnosed anxiety isn’t a disability, so she can do her job or leave. 

She quit, threatened a lawsuit, and walked out. When we returned to work on Tuesday (today), I noticed a couple of employees were a bit cold to me. The other ones were very eager to show me the unfavorable posts that their former coworker had made on social media over the weekend.

Peter and all his siblings all have very stunning blue eyes which they inherited from their mom. They always get compliments on their eyes. Peter and his girlfriend posted a picture on social media of their baby girl today saying she was born on the 23rd and I decided to give Peter a call to congratulate him. When I called he was with his girlfriend and the phone was on speaker. I congratulated both of them and said their baby was gorgeous and that they’ll be great parents. I then asked Peter “did she get your blue eyes?” (in the picture they posted on social media the eye color wasn’t visible) Peter and his girlfriend’s tone completely changed and his girlfriend said “Jesus, why are you so concerned by the eye color of my baby. It’s fucking weird” I was pretty taken aback by her reaction. I didn’t mean anything by it I was just curious. I thought this was a normal conversation point. I tried to say I didn’t mean to offend her and apologize but she kinda cut me off and said they were really busy and they had to go.

I told my mom what happened and she said that Peter’s girlfriend is a new mom and is probably just emotional and thought I was insulting her baby but that I didn’t say anything wrong. However my sister said I was out of line and that the fascination people have with blue eyes is weird and there were racial implications since Peter’s girlfriend is biracial (half Jamaican). This didn’t make sense to me. I never said not having blue eyes was bad. My eyes are brown! I was just curious!

AITA here?

Edit: Yeah ok Peter called our family to thank my mom for a gift and we talked a bit. I apologized again for offending them. He accepted my apology but said his girlfriend is was really mad at me but she’ll probably calm down in a day or 2. he explained that they’ve been harassed by family members from even before the baby was born about whether the baby would have blue eyes and his girlfriend is very annoyed by people’s fixation on eye color and feels there’s some racist undertone to it since blue eyes are “white features” and that people think her baby would be any less beautiful if it didn’t have blue eyes. Apparently his mom said during her pregnancy “too bad she probably won’t have blue eyes” and his girlfriend started crying and refused to talk to her for weeks. I feel really bad now.

She’s always been on the heavier side but for the last few years, each time I see her, she’s put on more and more weight. Her mother is also obese and has countless health conditions due to her weight and diet. I’ve been concerned about my bridesmaid for a while so I’ve invited her to come with me to the gym (she almost always bails), I come over and make healthier versions of her favorite foods, we go on walks instead of driving, etc.

A long time ago, I found the perfect bridesmaid dress. However, after more research, my bridesmaid’s size is a few sizes larger than the largest dress size. I let her know a year and a half in advance the situation and she insists on me keeping the dress and that she would lose weight. She seemed very excited about it and said this would be her motivation. I bought the dresses and ordered hers in the size she said she would become by the time of the wedding. 

It’s been a year since I’ve told her and I continuously see her post stories of her eating whole pizzas, drinking several sodas a day, and laying in bed watching Netflix all day. I’m very concerned for her health but I travel for work and can’t see her often to make food and go on walks with her.

I said that wasn't something I wanted. I've always had privacy on my tech and I hadn't done anything wrong. I knew it was my stepdads idea, not my mom. The rules have gotten a lot stricter since he moved in and I know this is something he came up with.

So I've let the battery die on both the phone and laptop and put them in a box in my closet. I've been using an old ipod touch that is somehow still working, that a friend gave me, to go on the internet and have music. I haven't told my parents I do this.

I also spend a lot of time doing things without tech now, I've been going for runs, hikes, lifting weights, drawing, reading books, etc. I've been getting into wilderness survival stuff as a hobby, learning how to make different kinds of shelters and traps for animals and stuff. 

My parents have gotten really mad I won't use the phone and laptop. Like they don't like that they can't get in touch when I'm on a run or hike. Or that I don't see things in the family group text. Or that I don't see emails and calls from extended family.

I don't mind giving up most tech, honestly it's lead to a lot of self improvement. I have a lot of time for fitness. I have been reading a lot of books. I've been learning a lot because I like to read nonfiction. And I realize I don't miss social media, all it did was made me feel bad about myself a lot of the time. All the stuff I was missing out on not being popular at school, all the girls with perfect makeup and bodies. I am a lot happier not having that and just focusing on my own fitness.

I didn't have a lot of friends at school, honestly my only good friend was my friend who gave me the ipod and we keep in touch through that now. 

My parents are mad enough that now that my birthday is coming up they're saying they won't give me anything unless I appreciate the last gifts they gave me. I say I do appreciate them but I don't appreciate not having privacy and also i just have other priorities but technology now.

I got tired of being single for most of my life so I downloaded a few dating apps and met this girl (26) who works in customer service for a huge company about 9 months ago. We hit it off and officially became exclusive three months ago.

Overall she’s a really great person. But there’s a few things about her that bother me, and I’m not really sure if it’s normal or not because I’ve never really been in an actual serious relationship.

-I always pay for everything on dates. I know that I make more than her and it doesn’t necessarily hurt me to always pay, but she doesn’t ever offer to pay or split the bill and she just expects me to always pay.

-The first time she came over to my apartment she was literally shocked. I live in a shitty one bedroom apartment because I want to pay off my student loans as fast as possible so I still basically live like a broke college student. She kept making comments about how I should move out and find a nicer place that suits a doctor.

-She wanted to introduce me to her family right away. I thought the relationship is too new to meet the parents but she insisted. And when we went to their house, her parents only asked about my job and salary.

-When we went out and ran into someone she knows she introduced me as her doctor boyfriend.

These things, plus some other stuff made me realize she doesn’t really care about me, just that I’m a doctor. So I told her. She blew up, saying I’m insulting her and calling her a gold digger, and that she’s just proud of me for being successful.

AITA?

Edit:
1)  I wanted to clear something up, my apartment is NOT dirty. When I said I live in a shitty one bedroom apartment I just meant that it’s really small. Poor wording on my part. 

2) I agree with a lot of you that I let my frustrations build up and then I just accused her instead of trying to talk to her. This is my first ‘real’ relationship so I have a lot to learn. 

3) It’s true that she doesn’t ask me for money or for expensive gifts. I’m starting to think I was too quick to assume anything.

4) I did a dual enrollment program in high school that allowed me to graduate from college two years early. So that’s why I’m an independent doctor at my age. I’m also turning 30 in a few weeks.

"AITA?

My boss told them that I am one of the top account managers in our unit and asked me what advice I can give the new hires on how to succeed at this job.

I said that our job is 30% work and 70% luck, sometimes you get big deals with minimal effort and sometimes you give it everything you have but the deal still doesn’t push through. But what’s important is to have good relationships with your co-workers because work is much easier when you have a positive work environment.

After the meeting my boss talked to me and he was not happy about the advice I gave. He said that he wanted the new hires to see me as a role model but instead I embarrassed him by encouraging them to be complacent since I said that 70% of the job is luck. He said that I know the advice I should give them is to set goals and work hard to achieve them as their careers are just beginning but I went with trying to sound cool instead of giving them the best advice.

I specifically avoided telling the new hires that they should work hard because I don’t work hard myself and everyone else in the room knows that. I’m not humble bragging. I was always an average employee, I just got lucky these past three years because even without asking my clients brought me their friends who also ended up doing business with me so the deals basically just fell into my lap. But even now I have a lot of lazy days where I procrastinate or I go on sudden leaves just because I don’t feel like working.

I didn’t want to be that person who doesn’t practice what she preaches, but should I have told them what they needed to hear instead of what I really wanted to say?

Edit: Wow this blew up.

Thank you to everyone who is worried that I might get fired or I won't be promoted because of what I said, thankfully promotions in our company depend on your performance. We have guaranteed merit increases as long as we meet their our budgets, and if you go over your budget you get a bigger increase. Unless I do something against company policies or I don't meet my budget for three straight years my boss also can't recommend my termination. Even then it's not my immediate boss who decides if I get fired, so I think I'm pretty safe.

I still believe that a big part of my achievements in the past three years is down to luck. I didn't do anything different than what I did the past five years. I was nice and accommodating to my clients before but they didn't refer any deals or the ones they did did not push through. I don't know what changed these last three years. But the reality is that the clients came to me and from there I just had to type some templated proposals.

In contrast I have coworkers who bust their ass marketing new clients on their own, they have good relationships with their existing clients but do not get referrals, or they make somersaults to sort out terms and conditions to make a deal happen but the client suddenly says he doesn't need the deal anymore. That's why I think that I've been lucky and I know this luck is not gonna last forever.

But I see your point that maybe I shouldn't have said what I did at a formal meeting like that in front of my boss.",False,1573773779.0,2019-11-14 13:11:27
AITA for adopting a dog with the same name as my daughter?,12202,Asshole,4131,cbqfsi,1562843034.0,"My wife and I have two kids, Kristopher (9) and Sadie (12). For Kris' birthday last Friday, my wife and I decided to get him a dog, which he has been asking for since he could talk and we feel he's finally responsible enough to walk/feed a dog himself.

My wife and I decided to adopt an older dog, not a puppy, and a medium sized dog, and preferably a girl dog because I've heard they have better temperaments. Other than that, it was up to me to pick one at the Humane Society and when I got there, I immediately fell in love with a sweet 30lb Pit mix with beautiful green eyes. When I saw her name was Sadie like our daughter, I thought it was a sign that she belonged with our family. My wife thought the coincidence was funny when I told her, too, which is important.

So I arranged the adoption and the shelter agreed we'd pick her up last Friday after a birthday dinner for Kris. I pretended we were stopping at another place in the plaza and went inside and came out with (dog) Sadie. BOTH kids were thrilled but Kris was the happiest I'd ever seen him, and everything was perfect until I told them her name. My daughter Sadie instantly said it was super embarrassing to have the same name as the dog and IMMEDIATELY insisted that Kris change Sadie's name. She kept trying to make him promise but she was already spoiling the birthday gift before we even left the parking lot so I told her we'd talk about it later.

Well, this week has been hellish. Kris is insistent we keep Sadie's name because she's 4 years old and has had that name her whole life. He says you wouldn't rename a 4 year old person and I think he has a point. I also think it's cute and funny that they have the same name. My daughter for some reason is mortified by this and won't even interact with me, her brother, or the dog. My wife, who thought it was cute at first, now says she sees Sadie's point and thinks we need to change the dog's name. I put my foot down because this is Kris' birthday present and his choice.

AITA for being livid at my roommate for calling me an ambulance?,12190,Asshole,3930,duxns4,1573530054.0,"So Thursday, I went to a party one of my friends threw. It was your pretty standard college party and I got pretty drunk yada yada. When I went back to my house, I was stumbling around trying to get to my room. One of my housemates helped me to my room and told me to sleep it off which I planned to do. 


I don’t remember too much since I blacked out but this is what some of my housemates told me. My roommate was in the room when I came in and he said I kept falling off the bed and talking to myself. He ended up calling an ambulance for me and apparently the EMTs forced me to go to the hospital and threatened to call the police if I didn’t go so I didn’t have a choice. 

When I woke up in the hospital the next morning, the nurse gave me papers to sign and then let me leave. They also stuck me with a $1000 hospital bill for the ambulance. Since I was basically dragged to the hospital, I left my keys and phone inside so I couldn’t get in. None of my housemates were home so I ended up just waiting outside of the house for like an hour before one of them finally came back. On top of that, I missed my CAD class which is a whole different story. 

I was absolutely pissed with my roommate for calling me an ambulance. Not only did I end up spending the night at some hospital, I got a $1000 bill on top of it too. It’s one thing if I had alcohol poisoning or something like that but I literally just slept at the hospital and left the next morning. The housemate who helped me inside was on my side, he said I was hammered but it wasn’t that bad and I could just sleep it off. The roommate said he got scared and didn’t know they would take me to the hospital but that just made me even more mad since there was like 5 other people in the house at the time and his first reaction was to call the police rather than ask the others. So AITA?

Edit: I’m not mad at my roommate for calling the ambulance. If I looked that ducked up, I would probably do the same. I’m upset about the fact that calling the cops was his first instinct rather than ask the other roommates. I mentioned my other housemate said I was super drunk but I could sleep it off and my roommate instantly decided to call the cops. I didn’t get any tests at the hospital, I literally just slept there for the night and left when I woke up. Some of the comments are correct in that the American healthcare system is unfortunately part of the issue here. I was willing to endanger myself rather than pay a $1000 bill I can’t afford.

I'm about 6'5. It's difficult but I manage. I'm out of town right now visiting my brother, his wife and their kids. My SIL is a kind of neurotic, tense person, a perfectionist, and she and I have never gotten along, but we're polite and civil for my big brother's sake. Plus, I love my nieces, so being nice to her is just carte blanche.

They have a small house so while I'm here they've had the younger daughter share a bed with the older one, giving me the five year old's bed. I knew right away that the little bed was gonna be waaaaaay too short but after my seven hour drive I just wanted some sleep. My feet stuck off the end a good foot and a half.

AITA For kicking my sister's kids out of my house?,12198,Asshole,4506,gwc0sq,1591281548.0,"I'm 35 and childfree. My sister is 33 and a mother of 3 kids - between 6 to 10 years of age, two boys and a girl . I have always had a strained relationship with my sister and usually avoid being around her kids, as I don't really like kids in general. Yesterday, my sister came over unannounced with her kids. She told  me her brother in law had met with an accident and she and her  hubby needed to go see him in the hospital. She said she needed me to watch her kids for the evening as our parents are out of town.

&#x200B;

I told her to get a sitter, but she said she couldn't get one on such short notice. I refused again, telling her I had never babysat before and was looking forward to  a quiet evening. First she told me she was just leaving them there. I told her I would call a child welfare committee and would report her for abandonment if she pulled something like that. She begged and pleaded and actually began to fake cry. As I didn't want to provide my neighbours with entertainment, I reluctantly agreed.

&#x200B;

At first things were fine. The kids were a bit rambunctious, but still somewhat tolerable. They ate their dinner, without starting a food fight and then I left them in the living room to watch a movie. I was in the study getting some work done. I had brought  my cat and dog in there with me as I wanted to keep them safe from the kids.  Suddenly,  I heard a loud crash . I rushed to the living room and found my precious, antique clock that I kept on the mantelpiece on the ground in pieces. It was worth well over $1k in USD. (I'm not American).

&#x200B;

I was furious of course, and asked how the hell this happened. The eldest kid incoherently explained that they had taken it down to look at it and then the younger two were fighting over it and dropped it. Cue ear shattering wailing from the other two, blaming one another for the demise of my prized possession.

&#x200B;

I had had enough. I called my brother in law and told him to come over immediately and get his spawn out of my home. He asked what was wrong and I told him what they had done. He had the gall to tell me I was overreacting. One of the kids, I think the youngest had started bawling now. I told my BIL to come at once and get his kids. He said he was on his way.

&#x200B;

He came to get the kids, but didn't leave before lecturing me on the importance of fAmIlY! I told him to get lost.

&#x200B;

This morning I recieved angry texts and phone calls from my parents and several relatives asking how I could be so ""heartless"" and how I could value a clock more that my niece and nephews. I've told them I don't care what they think. Because the way I see it, I was completely withi my rights in kicking them out. They should just be grateful that I've decided not to make my sister and BIL pay for it. Judging from the fact that they have 3 kids, they probably can't afford it.

&#x200B;

I want to know what Reddit thinks. Am I the asshole, or are they?

&#x200B;

Edit : Allow me to tell you exactly why my relationship with my sister is strained. It's because my sister has always been jealous of my success. For example, last year, I took a vacation to Spain and posted about it on Facebook. My sister is a housewife and her hubby had just lost his job. Apparently they were really struggling financially. Sis called me and berated me for having fun with MY hard earned money and flaunting it when they didn't know if they'd make it to the next month with having to ask family for help. She also expected me to offer her some cash, because ""family"". When I told her that her and her husband would be better off if they had fewer kids, she actually got angry and yelled at me. This is just one example of my sister's entitlement.

&#x200B;

Some of you said I shouldn't have left the kids alone. Well, before I left, I told them very clearly to keep their hands off of my stuff.

&#x200B;

Edit 2 : My mom just let me know that sister's BIL will be fine. He was driving under influence and has a dislocated shoulder and two broken ribs.

&#x200B;

And after much consideration, I've decided to sue. That clock was rare and expensive. ",True,1591278283.0,2020-06-04 07:39:08
AITA for not letting my little cousin drive my car?,12183,Not the A-hole,1044,h9x407,1592312714.0,"Last year on my 16th birthday, I got my license. When I got home, I had a brand new car sitting in driveway. It was a blue 2018 Ioniq Hybrid, and currently the love of my life. Her name is sparky and I adore her. I love sparky, I pay for my own gas and I keep her clean. 
I’ve haven’t been in a wreck and even though I’m not the best driver, Im very safe on the road. I am very privileged, and am very lucky that I have parents who love me enough and that are in a financial position to buy me a car. They don’t give me gas money (per my request, I work for my own) but they do pay for fixes when it needs it (flat tire, dead battery, etc). 
My aunt and cousin have been staying at my house for about two days now. My aunt is pretty nice and she is not in the financial position to buy my cousin a car. My aunt does own a car herself though. Today I got home from work and pulled into my drive way to see my cousin waiting for me. I parked and got out to ask her what she wanted. She asked me if I could take her to the mall (it opened in my area) and I said yes because I need to get a couple things for my mom because her bday is coming up. 
I go inside to change out of my uniform into some regular clothes and walk outside to see my aunt and cousin talking. My cousin stops talking when she sees me and nudges my aunt with her elbow. She walks up to me and says that my cousin got her license a week ago. Great, congrats. My aunt looks at my cousin and then asks if maybe I could let her drive to the mall. Ha, no. My aunt asks why and I respond with I’m not letting a 16 year old who’s had her license for a week drive my car. 
She got upset and said that she can’t afford to get cousin a car so she hasn’t driven since her drivers test. 
I asked why not let her drive your car? my aunt says that she doesn’t want cousin to crash it because she’s not a very good driver. I said why the hell would I want her to crash mine then? Aunt gets mad then says that my parents spoiled me, that it’s not really my car, and then goes to complain to my parents and ask them if cousin can drive it. Parents say nope, it’s up to op because it’s her car. Aunt gets mad then packs up with cousin and leaves. My parents said that I could’ve just let cousin drive the car, but why in the work would I let her after her own MOTHER says that she’s a bad driver? Aunt calls me and calls me a selfish bitch on the phone and tells me to think about how spoiled and privileged I am. AITA?

This post, this incident... it isn’t a one-time thing, as many of you have picked up on. Actually, the very next day we argued because I told him I was disappointed he didn’t take my photo. We’ve been together for nearly two years and he hasn’t taken my photo. Last time I brought it up he said it’s because we never go anywhere. The other day we went to the beach (restrictions have been lifted here). On the way home I mentioned, as gently as I could, that I would’ve liked it if he took my photo. Well. He was not pleased. “Here we f***ing go. It just doesn’t f***ing occur to me to take your photo! I’m in trouble for forgetting to do something! It doesn’t cross my f***ing mind! Get the f**k over it!” And so on. When we got home I went for a shower. Afterwards when I was getting dressed I started crying. I didn’t think he was in the house but he heard, and he came up to the bedroom and hugged me and said he’s sorry, hugged me some more. Then he left the room, and I kinda pulled myself together for a bit. Then, wondering what he was doing, I found him on the couch eating his dinner on his own. He saw me there and said “I fucking KNEW I’d be in trouble for this!” and on from there. Lots of swearing. I went to bed. He came up eventually, held me while I cried, said he was sorry, we went to sleep. Last night, he mentioned that I snore. I questioned him (laughingly) and he offered proof - he had taken a video of me snoring. That same night that he held me while I cried, that very night he recorded me snoring. Upset, I said “It ‘doesn’t cross your mind’ to take a photo of me in two years, but it DOES cross your mind to video me snoring?” He crossed his arms and got that look on his face and shook his head as though I was crazy. I asked if he understood why that might upset me. He said, “of course I do, but you need to get the fuck over it.”

This is life with him. This is every week. It’s like being with two different people. He’ll sometimes be sweet, then without warning he’ll be an asshole. Some of you said I should talk to him, that this is an issue we should be able to talk about. I agree: we should. But he won’t. Any time I bring something up (and I approach these things do gently), he tells me all I do is f***ing whinge. He’ll call me a f**khead or a c***. “If you stop being such a c*** you might get something.” He’ll treat me like this then at night he might say “Sorry for being an asshole.” He didn’t get me a birthday present (for two years), or an anniversary present - actually, he drunkenly crashed his car into a tree on our anniversary. I treat him like a prince and, I’m starting to realise, he treats me like dirt. I’m embarrassed that so many of you saw that straight away and knew the truth of my relationship before I did.  With all of the messages I’ve received, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. I feel a bit lost and confused and... I don’t even know the word. Tired. I’m tired. 

Thank you for your support.

Hello! Nothing too heavy here. 

My (39F) ‘partner’ (34M) asked me, “Can I make you something for lunch?” I answered, “Sure!” He went inside, I heard him in the kitchen for maybe 5 minutes, he came out with... some lunch for himself. Then it went like this:

Me (kinda laughing): Are you serious?
Him: What the fuck did I do now?
Me (confused): Didn’t you hear me say “sure” when you asked if I wanted lunch?
Him: I waited for you to tell me what you wanted, and when you didn’t, I thought ‘fuck ya’. 
Me: ... I don’t understand...

He got annoyed, said “there’s your lunch, enjoy” (pointing to his plate), and walked away, calling me a fuckhead. 

I think he’s an AH, he clearly thinks I’m an AH. I still don’t understand. Whenever I’ve asked him if he wants breakfast, for instance, if he says yes but doesn’t specify what he wants, I’ll still make him something. 

We were having a lovely day, I just don’t get it.

"AITA for having an ""unhealthy relationship"" with my daughter?",12107,,1854,cr4uat,1565982345.0,"This is something I did not put much thought into but since my Ex expressed her outrage, perhaps the internet can judge this. 


Without too much context, my Ex left me and our daughter Jo(not real name) many years ago and I have been raising her all by myself these years. She is 27 now, still living with me and works in a cafe nearby. 


Jo, while having the intelligence of a normal person(aced in Chemistry back in school), has the emotional maturity of a child. It does not take much for her to get upset or become happy, she loves praises and hugs, dislike strangers but warms up to them easily. She gets awkward talking to adults and loves playing with children, but would also pick fights and throw tantrums despite being 3 times their age. I can give more examples but I hope you get the idea. 


Me and Jo split the house chores and takes turns to cook for each other. We would also do ""Goodbye hug"" and ""Goodnight kiss"" on the cheek every day when we leave for work or go to sleep, separate rooms, to be clear. I would praise Jo if she has done her part of the chores properly as she likes praises, and also buy her snacks from time to time. 


I have not find another partner after my Ex because Jo would certainly be upset, and I have gotten used to staying this way. Jo has been single too(as far as I know) and has shown no intention of moving out, which I am fine with it. There has only ever been 2 of us in the house after Ex moved. 


My Ex, whose private life is not mine to share, paid us a visit some time ago, a long time in many years for an update on Jo. She was absolutely disgusted of our lifestyle. She said we were living like a couple which is not supposed to be, we are father and daughter for christ sake! She demanded that we seek therapy and have Jo moved out so that she can be independent and have her own life. Jo in turn, screamed at her birth mother and kicked her out of the house.  


I have nothing on my conscience as we never ever did anything questionable or vile. Therapy? We are both happy adults enjoying our lives. Have Jo move out? If she wants I won't stop her, but if she's happy here then she can stay as long as she likes. 


I do think I am not the AH who ""ruined"" my daughter's life with this ""unhealthy relationship"", but I shall leave you to judge. AITA?


Info: It is not medically proven but I believe Jo is not in the spectrum or has disabilities as many of you think. She is smart and functional and capable of living by herself(proven when I went business trips and left her home alone when she was in her teens, the house was kept clean and tidy), but she is also lazy and enjoys being spoilt. She has 2 close friends her own age, also single, and would hang out with them sometimes. I also believe that therapy is only required if it cause problems, and if she is happy with her life, even if it is a little out of the norm, I don't think we need any therapy.",False,1565959993.0,2019-08-16 12:05:45
[Update] WIBTA if I confronted my downstairs neighbor about a weird smell coming from their apartment?,12119,UPDATE,434,hcabzz,1592634692.0,"
Sorry for not updating this sooner. 

[OP IS HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gkjb7m/wibta_if_i_confronted_my_downstairs_neighbor/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So I called my landlord a couple days after the post to advise of the situation to see what could be done about the smell or see if they could look into it. They asked for a description of the smell, the time it happens during the day, where I smell it, asked about a few general conditions in my apartment, and told me they’d look into it. 

The whole thing kind of slipped my mind after that phone call- to be honest I wasn’t super concerned about it being a dead body and thought y’all were crazy, but the smell went away about three days later and I never smelled it again. I’ve been stressed out and pretty bummed about life in general so I really didn’t give a rats ass either way what it was, I was just happy it was gone and never bothered to follow up on it. 

YESTERDAY I saw a coroners office vehicle parked out front of my building and I had an “oh shit..” moment. I waited until today to call my landlord, I said I was just following up on the smell because I haven’t smelled it, and I was also concerned about the coroners visit yesterday. Landlord couldn’t release too much info but told me that someone had been deceased for some time in one of the units, and that’s it. 

I don’t know anyone in my building except for “Hi’s and bye’s”, so I don’t know who it was, what apartment or anything, and I don’t feel close enough to any of my neighbors to ask around, but damn, that’s kind of a bummer.. that smell was around for a while.. 

Anyways; kind of a sad update I guess, but you guys were right. Damn... 😐",False,False,2020-06-19 23:31:32
"AITA for sending my family an angry email because they still speak to my ex-husband and even have him over, especially in light of his present “relationship” with a girl 20 years younger than him?",12059,Asshole,1720,cjt1ng,1564528032.0,"So basic background is I’m 42, two kids age 14 and 12 and signed divorce papers in April after almost 2 years of it being drug out trying to get my fair share from him. The details of “why” are not important but I’m angry, embarrassed, lost and sad any given moment of the day. A lot of this has to do with feeling like I’ve been “replaced” by a 23 year old surfing instructor who is everything I’m
not. My husband and kids claims that she is just his friend and helping him learn his life long desire to surf but Jesus Christ...give me a break. 
 

My husband has primary custody because he had better lawyers who were able to manipulate some minor missteps on my part into the court seeing them as a huge deal. So this past weekend I picked up the kids and said we were going to visit my parents. They said they would rather use thier season passes to sea world since they spent all weekend with my parents and Aunt Stacey and Uncle Brian (my brother and sister who I didn’t even know were in town). I was like your dad took you? They said yes that my parents had invited him over to see everyone. I was devastated because while I don’t get along with my brother and sister (and my mom) they let my ex-husband know they were coming and not me. I can’t even let that sink in without tears forming. I sort of jested that “oh and let me guess Ms Surf Instructor was there too?” My daughter said “well actually we all went to her house in ocean beach because she gave Stacey and Brian lessons after ours.” That included my mom and dad. I was so devastated I took the kids back home and just went home and cried for an hour. 

When I was done I sent a furious email to my entire family how inappropriate they all had been and then not only hanging out with my ex for an entire weekend, but his little chippy as well is a massive slap in the face and the fact they didn’t even tell they were in town let alone invite me makes me feel so alone. 

My mom was the only one to respond and she basically said “yes it was rude we didn’t tell you Stacey and Brian were  here and we shouldn’t have done that. But we didn’t divorce Bradley, and we still see him as a son. This email along with your behavior over the last 5 years should really give you insight into why we might not want you at family events.” 

In so many words she called me asshole for sending the email, was I?

AITA for not deleting a tribute post to my deceased wife I made two years ago?,12064,Not the A-hole,926,e26yzi,1574840773.0,"Two years ago my late wife died in a tragic car accident. She was going to work in a snowstorm when her car was hit by an out of control semi-truck. She was killed instantly. 

Of course when I got the call, I was devestated. We had been married for just two years. Now I was only 27 and widowed. It took months of healing and regaining my faith in God and in this world to move. In part of that healing, I posted a tribute of her to my Instagram (at the time of her passing) saying all these things I wanted her to be remembered for. I ended it with ""I will always love you, *name*, rest in peace my love.""

A few months ago I met a new girl at work. We hit off really well and things picked up fast. She was a bit controlling, but I kind of liked it, that someone was really protective of me. It wasn't overbearing controlling, but just enough to make me feel cherished. A few days ago though, (and my now GF knows of my deceased wife), said she saw my tribute post to her and asked if I could take it down. 

I was really confused and asked why; she said ""it has love, that is the present tense, do you still love her?"" and ""its been three years, you need to move on."" 

I told her ""I loved my late wife, and I have moved on, that why I felt ready to date you."" She then said ""if thats true, you should have no problem deleting the post."" I dont want to delete the post though. She was still my wife, she died tragically, she deserves to be remembered for more than just being a wife, she was  great person - and a nurse, too.

WIBTA if I set my Mother in Law up to drop in on my roommate jerking off?,12056,Not the A-hole,980,ddsh8v,1570334621.0,"So, the title is probably almost as weird as the actual explanation. Bear with me.

I've got the typical awful, overbearing MIL situation. The woman doesn't like me, hasnt for roughly 6 years now. Her son and I have been together almost 7 years. We have two kids. She's done everything from boundary stomping, criticizing our parenting choices, threatening to have our child taken from us and placed in her custody if we moved out of state, and threatening to call CPS if we didnt bow to her wishes. Suffice to say this woman is insane, and we DID end up moving 2000 miles away with zero chance of losing custody, obviously.

So, we are no contact with her off and on. Currently we hear from her once every 3 months or so and see her once a year. The most recent time she was in town, she gave my boyfriend an amazon alexa for the kids. It's one of the fancy ones with the screen and camera for video chatting. Now, maybe I'm just being petty because her and I obviously dont get on, but I'm not interested in seeing or hearing from her any more than we do already.

My boyfriends younger brother and his girlfriend, when they found out that she had gotten this for us, warned me to disable the drop in permissions because this woman was just randomly dropping into the device and accessing the camera into their apartment. So I was INSTANTLY suspicious of this fucking thing. I disabled the permissions, and the kids aren't allowed to use it unless someone is in the room anyway.

I was talking about how shady it was with our roommate, and he said that he had a MUCH better idea than disabling it.

Put it in his room, and any time he feels like it, he'll just jerk it while making direct eye contact with the camera.

I feel like disabling it is enough, but I would be lying if I said this wasn't a hilariously tantalizing prospect. Is it over the top to do this if I'm pretty confident that she WOULD just drop in and see this happening?

Thanks in advance!

"AITA for breaking up a relationship between our son and a girl, who both have disabilities?",12027,Not the A-hole,1241,dja80y,1571364552.0,"I honestly feel like the biggest asshole on Earth.

I have a 16 year old son with severe physical disabilities. He uses a motorized wheelchair and requires help to get in and out of it.

My husband and I are in a friends group of families with similarly disabled children.

My son recently announced that he is dating a 17 year old girl from the group. My only problem is that this girl has severe mental and physical disabilities. She has the mental capacity of a young child, is mostly nonverbal and has tics that will cause her to hit other people in the vicinity.

My son has zero mental disabilities. I was very uncomfortable with this relationship because of the huge difference in mental capabilities. My husband felt the same but not as strongly. 

However, literally everyone in the group has been thrilled about this ""romance"". Especially the girl's parents. They are talking about the two getting married for heaven's sake.

I thought that I'd just wait it out and have our son realize on his own that he cannot have a meaningful relationship with this girl.

But it's been 5 months and it's only getting worse.

I ended up putting my foot down and informed both my son and the girls parents that this relationship was completely inappropriate. Especially since my son has now started being hit by the girl during her tics and he is physically unable to defend himself. My husband supported me in this.

We have become enemy number one ever since. The parents have attacked us through texts and have turned everyone in the friends group against us.

But the thing that has hurt us most is our son's reaction. He has accused us of ruining his one shot at love. 

We've been to family therapy but my son has decided to ignore us completely not give us the silent treatment. My husband and I have decided not to cave.

AITA for not consulting my roommate about some of the things I do to the dorm,12024,Not the A-hole,940,cy9jf6,1567370983.0,"Hello! I posted here before about this girl before because she used to constantly have the heat on in summer. We got that worked out but now everything else is a problem.

I just started college as a freshman at an art school and they gave us the option to join dorms that had our interests and find people to live with who are like us. Our dorm is like an apartment, with two rooms that two people share. The rooms are a bit small but the living room is a big empty space with a couch and a sad little table. 

Me and 2 other girls got put into this dorm for gamers and then we had a guy as our 4th so they had to switch us for this last girl very quickly. She's nothing like us, which wouldn't be an issue if she wasn't how she is. 

The first issue that I had with her was the fact that she had the heat on in the dorm, but she got a heater for herself and that got worked out. 
The school has a wall in each dorm that they specifically let us draw on, it's strange but I like it. The 3 of us are illustration majors while this girl is a photography major. We started drawing on our wall and this girl made a fit about it, saying how we didn't ask if she'd be okay with it. 

She had a 'meeting' with us where she complained that we made the living room a 'gaming room' because my roommate brought her monitor out and plugged in my switch and we played super smash bros one night. It was super fun to me

This girl has had friends over but complains when I have mine over, and I heard her talking to her friends about us. I have a class with one of her friends and he just kinda gives me weird looks the whole time. When me and my roommate were walking, her friends were sitting on a bench talking and when we walked by they all stoped talking and gave us weird looks again. 

She's vegan, and yesterday sent a long message about how when we make meat we need to clean extremely well for her in the kitchen and stuff, which I understand but it was just so annoying how she she wrote it. 

Well, last night I bought a fluffy black rug for the living room in our dorm. I thought it would look nice because of the big empty space. This girl went OFF. she said black is ugly and hides dirt, and I should have consulted everyone when getting a rug. I got this rug because me and the two other roommates went to Target and she didn't wanna come with, and when we saw rugs we thought it would be cool to get one for the living room. When I was out, I picked one up with everyone's happiness in mind. I told her ""nobody consulted me over the dish soap"" and left. That was probably a bad thing to say but I was mad and sad.

She sent me a long text this morning about how I'm nasty for the soap and the black rug and immature and all these things. I'm just hurt honestly, but maybe I'm the asshole and she's reasonable.

Am I the asshole?

Update: I walked into the living room yesterday to the rug rolled up in a ball, so I just decided to put it in a corner as I didn't want to cause more drama. I sent her a message apologising and asking if we could talk like adults and she's been blatantly ignoring me and being very friendly in our roommate group chat as well as to the others in general. It's hard to just let this go as it makes me feel like trash. I genuinely miss living alone.

Edit: I emailed the RA for my floor and he and i talked about the issues I was having, hopefully we'll have a dorm meeting with an RA to help and if she wants there's an option for her to move to a different dorm

I am screenshooting and reporting to admins. Hopefully something is done about this behavior. I get that those sending these messages are likely teens themselves, but that doesn’t make it okay. Despite my daughter’s problems and poor judgment, I am grateful that I didn’t raise someone that hateful and disturbed. For those who care, she is going to live with her father and moving before the end of the month. He’s agreed to it, and I’m hoping it gives her a fresh start.**

I won’t go into the sordid details.  She’s an older teen and has had lots of issues since she started high school, mostly stemming from rebellion, I think. Her father always played the “Disney dad” role (because she only stayed with him every other weekend + summers/holidays). So discipline was solely on me. She’s 18.5 but hasn’t graduated high school yet and has no real plans with respect to work or college. (She would have already graduated but that’s a whole other story). 

What I mentioned in the title was my final straw. I trusted her to leave her alone but ended up coming home early when my plans got ruined last minute. (Was hanging out with a group of friends, but the host’s kid got sick, so we all ended up leaving early). So I walk in on my daughter in my bed with some guy I don’t even know. 

I told her I have had it and she’s going to live with her dad. That means she’s either going to have a 45 min commute to school or transfer. I don’t really care which at this point because I am at my breaking point. If her dad won’t take her in full time, she can go live with friends, I guess, but I’m not planning on giving financial support. (My ex and I had a CS agreement that ended at 18, no caveats). 

Am I wrong for reaching my limit with this extreme boundary cross? My sister thinks I’m being harsh. I said, in that case, she can take her! But at this point, I feel like I’m done.

Update: AITA for telling my wife that I don't think it is right to force our daughter to hang out with her same aged cousin?,11997,UPDATE,382,hbo4gb,1592546820.0,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/grlu13/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_i_think_its_wrong/

Recap: I made a post 3 weeks ago after getting into an argument with my wife. To make a long story short, my 13 year old daughter didn't want to hang out with her 13 year old cousin outside of our Sunday family dinners. She had nothing against her cousin but they have very different interest. My daughter, Kaylee, likes playing sports and video games and talking about boys. My niece, Gia, likes playing ""mommies"" and ""school."" Nothing wrong with that but Kaylee outgrew it and feels like they don't have much in common. To make things harder Gia get very upset if things aren't going her way (locking herself in the bathroom) and won't sleepover our house because she gets homesick so all sleepovers are at Gia's house.

Update: I talked to my wife about everything and she agreed she overreacted. She said that after he mom died she felt like it was her job to hold the family together. She is the middle child so she felt like she was the link between her two sisters. Their dad stressed to them how much they needed to stick together and that is where the weekly family dinners started. It was a way to bring everyone together. When my wife got pregnant with our son Chris at the same time her older sister got pregnant with her daughter Emma my wife said it felt like fate, especially since her older sister's son Owen would only be a little more than a year older than both kids. My wife said watching all 3 of them bond like they did made her proud because she knew it is what her mom would want. Even now the kids are close. My son slept over their house last night, they play some school sports together, have classes together, share some friends and sit at the same lunch table. When we found out we were having Kaylee only a few months after Gia was born my wife and her sister imagined the girls growing up together the same way the older 3 did. For a while they did but now that they are growing apart it has been hard on both my wife and her younger sister. When the older 3 were in middle school they hung out everyday in the summer but that was by choice and usually with a larger common friend group. I explained to my wife that this is different because we would be forcing Kaylee to miss out on time with her friends to spend with her cousin multiple times a week even though they have virtually nothing in common. My wife apologized to Kaylee and talked to her sister about giving the girls some time apart. We will still see them once a week for Sunday dinners but we aren't going to force it. My wife's sister was upset because Kaylee is Gia's only ""friend"" but said she will just have to spend more time with Gia to make her feel special. My wife and I feel bad but we want to make sure our daughter knows that she has the right to say no and have that be respected if she isn't comfortable with a situation even when it's family.",False,False,2020-06-18 23:07:00
AITA for telling an Irish-American to stay in her lane?,12048,Not the A-hole,1951,hg9fkf,1593213308.0,"Basically I recently moved to America from Ireland in the last few months working in an IT. Now despite always finding Americans who say they're Irish or ""plastic paddies"" as we call them back in Ireland annoying, I knew when people say that in America, they just mean their heritage so ""when in Rome, do as Romans do"". So on occasion, when I tell people i'm Irish, i'd get the odd American saying ""Oh cool i'm Irish too cause my great great great granddaddy was from Ireland"" followed by cringey questions like ""did you know we Irish were slaves too?"" I'd let this slide, smile and nod and just to try to change the subject as soon as possible.

Now in the IT where I work, there's this woman (lets call her Julie) who claims to be Irish because of a grandparent I think and she was basically the plastic paddy stereotype e.g. ""I have an Irish temper"" and ""I had too many Irish car bombs last night"". Once again, I let it go because when in Rome. Then one day during a group meeting, when people asked me what its like in Ireland, she kept interrupting me and basically took over the conversation about what its like in Ireland despite admitting to never being. It got to the point where I was becoming visibly irritated but once again said nothing because when in Rome. Then when she went to the bathroom, people started laughing saying ""you looked so annoyed there"" and I made one comment saying to them ""just because your great great grandfather once had a Guinness in Cork doesn't make you Irish"" which all but one woman laughed at. That one woman turned out to be one of her closest friends. 

Then Julie confronted me about mocking her because obviously her friend grassed. I then just told her straight up she's not Irish and to not speak over me when it comes to experiences in Ireland, and to ""stay in your lane"". She then went off in a huff and hasn't talked to me since. AITA?",False,1593189532.0,2020-06-26 16:15:08
AITA for correcting my title on a wedding RSVP card?,11964,Not the A-hole,4395,ccwpt1,1563093253.0,"Throwaway account because my boyfriend is a Redditor.

I received a wedding invitation a few weeks ago addressed to “Mr. (boyfriend) and Ms. (me).” I’m a doctor, and consider it proper etiquette to have my title included on a formal invitation. The RSVP card space where we were expected to write our names read “M________”, so I crossed out the M and wrote “Dr. (my name) and Mr. (my boyfriend).” This isn’t a casual backyard wedding, it’s black-tie.

I was expressing my annoyance to our mutual male doctor friend, and found out that she addressed his invitation with the appropriate title.

The bride-to-be messaged me today to tell me that she thinks I’m being pretentious and that my correction was obnoxious. I didn’t mention that I knew she had used the doctor title for our other male friend, but I was tempted.

So guys, AITA?

EDIT: I’m a DVM, my friend is an MD. My correction was related to formal invitations/place-cards. No, I will not be introducing myself as a doctor nor insisting that anyone call me doctor at the wedding. The groom is my friend from high school and introduced me to my current boyfriend.

She’s a cool, small, little thing who chills near my desk and occasionally I bring her lil treats to eat. Sometimes she disappears and sometimes she comes back. I’ve named her. I like her. 

My colleague Michelle is aware of the spider, and is always complaining that it’s a pest and needs to be killed. Recently she saw the web, not even the actual spider, and started an official whiteboard scoresheet if anyone is in favor of the spider being removed. Apparently she’s super scared and terrified and being even a little bit close to my office is enough to make her jittery. 

Luckily most people voted that the spider stays, but a few of her friends wrote some strongly worded notes that the spider is a sign of poor housekeeping etc. I must admit I was a little peeved at this, especially because we are a pet friendly workspace and Michelle’s own dog comes in to work sometimes and we have people who are genuinely frightened of dogs and Michelle doesn’t bother keeping her on a leash or anything. 

It came to a head when we had a meeting and Michelle bought up that she refused to go into my office because of the spider and she was scared of it. My boss was a little irritated and told me to remove it or kill it, I straight up refused and told him he wouldn’t ask Michelle to remove her dog and the spider is a LOT less threatening than a poorly behaved dog. He ultimately agreed and since then all she’s done is go on about how I don’t care about her feelings and that I must enjoy watching her suffer.",False,False,2019-09-23 23:05:17

Instead i have had 2 passive aggressive notes through my door, one complaining about crisp packets and sweet wrappers in my front garden (this is actually my other neighbours disabled son who doesn't know any better)

""Hi, can you please not throw litter in your front garden"" 

and another just recently about my gate banging in the wind (it doesn't, I checked) 

""Hi just to let you know your side gate isn't bolted and bangs during the night"" 

This morning she had a builder commence building her a new shed at 0720 on a Saturday morning, crashing wood around and using a loud saw/hammering waking me up. 
I KNOW I would have got another note for this. 

I wrote one myself

""Hi, just to let you know that a builder was sawing wood in your garden at 0730 this morning. You may now stop posting passive-aggressive notes through my door"" 

Am i the asshole, or just petty?

UPDATE : 

Karen my estranged neighbour replied by posting another note through my door

"" I was not being aggressive, I was just letting you know your gate was unlocked that was all!!!""
The ""That was all"" had two exclamation marks and was double underlined so i guess this means it's war... (joke)

Funny thing is she didn't even mention the builders or apologise for the previous notes or this mornings noise. Why mention the noise my gate was making at all if she just was just wanting me to me to bolt it? Why mention the rubbish at all if I can see it right there? I'm not fucking Stevie Wonder Karen....
She currently has her boyfriend parked in my second parking space, I don't use it often but it's the principle to at least ask first (now that's petty)

My husband and I loved him so much and gave him all the love and care he needed to make through the difficult times.

Since his death I have been getting a lot of ""advice"" on how to move on in life and pretend like my son didn't even exist.
Just like what they did when my husband passed away two years ago, my Brother in law (husband's brother) has always been a total asshole to me, one week before my husband died he told my husband to not worry about me cause I will marry again.
He told this while he was dying!
My husband was a great man, he was a donor, He cared for our son and always wanted for him to be happy.

He said ""why are you still so sad for your son? You should be happy for him, you should be happy for both of you, Him not having to deal with his disability anymore  and you being free, now you can go live your life without having to have to take care of a disabled person""
""It wasn't like he was gonna make it to 50 right?""

I felt just awful, I got so angry with him, I told him he was an asshole and told him to get out of my house, he started running his mouth again and said ""I know you're just acting out cause you're grieving, but that does not excuse your shitty behavior towards me and my wife""

Before he left, I told him to hand me the spare key to my house that he STOLE from my husband before he died, he lifted it up then instead of giving to me, he tossed it in the trashpin.

AITA for taking my niece out of drama club because she failed PE?,11921,Asshole,2760,duttpt,1573514585.0,"My niece is living with my family and I due to some personal reasons. She moved in right at the end of the school year last year. This year, she started high school. In our state, you have to have two years of PE to graduate. My niece asked if she could do it online like my kids, and we said sure, no problem. 

The way the online program works is pretty simple. Over a 180 day term (plus weekends) students must clock in 60 hrs of physical activity on a Fitbit provided through the school. There aren’t set exercises or anything like that. The students do whatever they want, and as long as the Fitbit registers it, it counts. For example, my son and one daughter got theirs through sports, but my other daughter looks up dance routines on the computer. 

Also, the 60 hrs can be divided however a student wants. They can do an hour a day and be done in two months, or they can do 20 minutes a day for the whole 180, or any other combination, as long as it gets done. There are smaller goals throughout the year, like 30 hrs by midterm in December and 15 hrs by the end of October. 

My niece hasn’t met these goals. In fact, she hasn’t registered a single minute of what the Fitbit counts as real physical activity. And she says it’s not a malfunction. She thought that walking to class and drama (even though by her own admission they mostly stand and read) would be enough. She said that between homework and drama, she didn’t have time for exercizing. 

Our house rule is if you fail a class, you’re pulled from all extra curriculars, no matter your other grades. My wife and I called the school and told them we were pulling my niece from drama and why. 

Now her parents are furious. Her mom all but said it was abuse. My brother can’t believe we’d pull her from something she loves so much w/o consulting them, even though when we asked for input on what classes to put her in, they said that we should trust our judgment.

I don’t know. AITA for pulling her out of it?


Edit: I was unclear; my apologies. She has failed the class by not meeting this goal. They have officially removed her as of this evening. 

Before anyone jumps on me, I didn’t explain properly. The students can do as they wish with logging the time, as long as they meet each smaller goal.


Edit 2: It seems most people think we are assholes, however, those people seem to be overlooking that two credits of PE are required for graduation. This class is not a simple elective which can be forgotten. As such, our punishment stands. She will stay out of drama until next year.

I also have 3 other children who are 11, 6 and 2. My 11 and 18 year old share a bathroom, and the 6, 2 year old and myself use mine.

My daughters bathroom is currently out of order due to some pipes so we’ve all been sharing mine. 

My 18 year old daughter has been taking long long baths lately, and I know why. She’s masturbating. It’s uncomfortable but I want her to know her body.

But she’s been leaving her vibrator on the counter when she leaves my bathroom. I’ve told her 4 separate times she needs to take it with her, because her siblings don’t need to get a hold of it and if she keeps doing this I’m going to get rid of it.

This morning it was once again left on my counter, so I threw it away in the outside trash. 

She stormed into my bedroom while I was getting ready yelling at me about how dare I throw away something she paid for with her own money, and I’m just trying to shame her blah blah blah. 

It was a relatively expensive vibrator, and I do feel slightly bad about throwing it away instead of just reprimanding her again, but I feel like I had to because she wasnt listening.


AITA for throwing away my daughters vibrator?

ETA: I’m her mom. I’d be fucking mortified if I was her father and I knew my teenage daughter was masturbating in my bathtub. My husband and I are divorced.

ETA #2: I thought about hiding it, but I know my child, she would get another one and keep doing it. Doing something extreme like throwing it away was the only way to get my point across. While yes she is an adult and she bought it with her own money, she lives in my house with 0 bills, 0 responsibilities. She goes to school (which I’m SO PROUD of) and she works part time. Other than that, I care for all her needs. This is my house and my young children and she didn’t respect my boundaries I tried to gently but firmly set the first time. Maybe that makes me the asshole and I will full heartedly accept that.


Last edit but I’m fixing the bathroom. I’m not just leaving it alone, but it takes a while. This has only been over the course of a week.

There's my full brother (16), my half brother (18 months), my step brother (19), and step sister (17). None of us have ever gotten on with our steps and I'm only staying with them now because I couldn't stay with my flatmate (a nurse), my dad (high risk), or my boyfriend (roommate problem). Mum lost her job due to current events and stepdad has been furloughed, so they asked me and my step brother to pay them ""rent"" to help cover expenses (they own the house so this is bills/food) and we agreed to each pay £400 a month.

All my siblings are here full time as my stepsiblings bio mum is high risk. My stuff in my room keeps going missing/being moved by people who aren't me. I have proof it was my step-relatives, though they claim innocence. There's also been a knocking issue which 3 days ago resulted in my stepsister walking in on a videocall with my boyfriend, which was both embarrassing and a mood killer.

After that last thing I ordered a lock online and yesterday I fit the lock on my door. My stepdad tried to stop me, saying it's his house, and he's not allowing anyone to have locks on their door. I was a little childish, as I had my headphones on so I just gestured to my headphones and pretended I couldn't hear him until he got frustrated and left and I kept on fixing the lock on the door. I offered him and mum the spare key as a peace offering, but said I'd be keeping the lock for the issues described in the previous paragraph, which led to an argument about trust.

Today I had several calls with clients in the office (bottom floor of the house while my room is the top floor) and told everyone I'd be in there for about 8 hours. I came out of the office at the end of my workday, went up to my room to get changed, and my door is fully gone. I asked what the fuck happened and my stepdad said the door was in his and mum's room and the hinges were in the wheelie bin, and that this'll teach me to disrespect him. I can't get the hinges out of the bin, and I can't get the door back upstairs on my own. Due to the layout of my room, there is no longer any privacy, unless I do everything (including getting changed) under the bed covers.

I am writing this from the office. I will be sleeping on the sofa in here tonight because at least the office has a door. I have not paid rent for June yet. I complained to my boyfriend about the situation and he said to just come to his tomorrow and he'd sort out the roommate. I've packed my stuff up and put it all in my car, with the intention of leaving this morning and calling after I've arrived to tell people where I am. My brother caught me moving stuff and I had to tell him. He then called me an arsehole because I wouldn't be helping out for June or giving them time to sort themselves out, and this is my only hesitation as I do feel bad about this part.

WIBTA for leaving/not paying rent?

Info: signs of intrusion were my clothes going missing and stepsister wearing them - she claims they were in with her laundry but I do my own laundry specifically to avoid my stuff getting mixed in with hers, various items and sections of my room being rearranged, for example I have a very specific method of organising my shirts and this order was messed up multiple times. Also snacks/drinks I bought for myself and put in my room were going missing after stepdad/stepbrother complained that I didn't share with them, even though I left plenty of snacks in the kitchen but kept a few just for me because I'm vegetarian and eat eggs/dairy but also try to avoid byproducts like certain kinds of food colouring/oils and gelatin.

She also got the dog without consulting me, it was literally a spur of the moment thing with her, and not one time did I bitch about it, or trip. He’s the loveliest Golden Lab mix with green eyes. I will say he’s a handful, and though our apartment is spacious, it’s only but so big. I feel like he sleeps most of the time, but when he’s in play mode, he can be a bit much. 

I pretty much chalk it down to the lack of special attention, obviously she’s pregnant so the urge to take him out and walk him on a consistent basis while I’m at work is rather non existent. I’m not saying she doesn’t at all, but I feel like a properly trained dog is gonna behave and adhere to house rules. I take him out at least twice a day, and to the park at least twice a week, though I’m well aware that he should be at the park more. 

Secondly I just feel like she’s missing the principle. She took on the responsibility, and now she’s “overwhelmed”. She even laughed when her sister in law suggested we put him on the side of the road at her sister’s mother day dinner... Not to mention she rushed into finalizing to move into our current apartment which she low key hates. She’s a serial offender when it comes to this type of stuff. 

Furthermore, I feel like I compromise with literally everything, whenever her 4 nieces and nephew want to come over I might bitch, but I give in. I give in to whatever she wants to eat, whatever she wants to drink, when we order food, I pay all the bills and utilities, I pay whenever she needs her hair done, etc... She literally has zero responsibilities. She hardly cooks, or cleans, and I get it she’s pregnant. 

I just feel as though, she can be a really selfish person at times, but this time she’s gone too far. I’ve invested financially and emotionally into the dog, and we haven’t even had him a full month.

AITA For taking away my pregnant wife's dinner because she upset me,11913,Not the A-hole,1671,gluwx0,1589806445.0,"Hi AITA,

I will try and keep this brief and answer any questions I get. My wife is currently pregnant and it's been an interesting few months to say the least. A lot of my wife's friends warned her about how intense the cravings can get and she hasn't really got them that bad but in a few instances she has had cravings that have put me in a somewhat unsavory position (e.g. having to drive 40 minutes at 3AM to get my wife this specific food from our home country that my in-laws had at their house because she woke me up and said she couldn't wait at all). After incidents like that one I sat down and had as candid of a conversation as possible about how I realise I wasn't the one who was pregnant and hence it was easier for me but I couldn't keep throwing everything down to get her whatever she needs because she is pregnant. 

That was all background to an incident that happened last night. I am the one who cooks mostly and last night I cooked a dinner that we both like a lot. It is a 'pizza-like' dish from our home country that I will not name but it is very similar to pizza in that it is of that type and is split into pieces that each person can take and eat. I spent about 1 hour cooking it and mixed a salad to eat as well, so that we each got half of the 'pizza' and some salad for dinner. My wife was sitting down at the table ready for dinner and I brought over the 'pizza' and set it down. I then went back to the kitchen to get the salad and when I came back my wife had taken all of the 'pizza' onto her plate. Now I should say I have cooked this meal quite a few times and it had always been that we took half each, so I asked her hey how come you took it all? She said that she realised that I liked it but she had a really bad craving for it and couldn't I just take the salad for this once so she could have the 'pizza'. I told her that if she was craving it then that's okay to just give me 1 piece (out of 10) so I could atleast have a taste but she refused saying she wanted it all, and that I could just eat salad only for one night. This started an argument and I just told her that I found it rude that she was trying to stop me from having 1 piece of my own food that I cooked. She still refused to give me a single piece and then said something that really hurt me, ""honestly you should stick to salad in general anyways"". I am not happy with my weight and I've been losing weight slowly but this comment made me upset so I told her enough and took the plate. At this point I now have the remaining 'pizza' left and told her she can eat salad or come apologise and took the food to eat on our alfresco. 

I can definitely see how I was an asshole for taking my wife's dinner from her but at the same time I acted in hurt so I am curious what others think.",False,False,2020-05-18 05:54:05

Just taking care of the animals is a chore itself it involves shoveling, bending, pushing and lifting and often chasing something that makes a break for it since my kids often open the gate and forgot to close it. 

The children can also be a handful my 2 year old is very whiny and clingy and cries at the drop of a pen. Anyways I was folding some laundry in the living room and my husband and MIL came in. I hadn’t seen my husband yet and he came over and gave me a kiss and asked me about my day.

I told him I was hurting in my back and was having some Braxton Hicks contractions so he said “Baby you don’t have to do the laundry or cook dinner today I’ll do it. If you don’t feel like doing anything at all when I come home I’ll do it and you can just hang out with the kids and rest” 

I thanked my husband and told him I would still fold the laundry but I would love if he would make dinner.

AITA for not letting my ex in law speak to my daughter unless she says her name properly?,11889,Not the A-hole,1727,fqkbfr,1585431451.0,"I'm Irish. A decade ago I met Ex. 2 years in I got pregnant. We married, and when our daughter was born he let me pick her name, so I gave her a very Irish name. Fake name I'm using is Saoirse, and the real name is different but similarly Irish and hard to say unless you've heard it already.

Ex's mother (MIL) would ring once a week and come to Ireland a few times a year. I always ended up cooking/cleaning for her (she'd stay with us), and when she was on the phone Ex would say ""do you want to speak to OP?"" and I'd have to talk to her. I didn't like this because she hated me, as she was very anti-Irish, and anti-me by extension.

Eventually I told Ex that I was done with MIL. He and Saoirse can keep talking to her, but if she calls then don't put me on, and if she comes to visit she can get a hotel and they can go meet her.

A few years ago Ex and I began to have problems. Eventually he asked me for a divorce. The custody agreement we ended up with gave me majority custody, but he gets summer holidays and every other Christmas. He was moving back to England and asked if he could still have contact with Saoirse, so we worked out a schedule for him video calling once a week for 30 mins. He's remarried, his wife is pregnant, and the number of calls from him has been going down, which doesn't surprise me as it's a tricky pregnancy.

As he's been calling less MIL has been using his skype account to call us in the time slots he isn't using. Because it's a video call on my laptop I can hear everything, including MIL calling Saoirse by the name ""Sue"". I didn't say anything on the call but after I asked Saoirse if that was the first time MIL did that and Saoirse said that MIL gave her an ""English name"" but she didn't like it. I asked some follow ups and found out MIL also corrects her speech when she uses Irish dialect and asks her to tone down her accent.

I was fuming but didn't do anything until the next video chat where I heard MIL call her Sue, and then I asked Saoirse to go wash up, took her seat, and said ""you know her name is Saoirse, right?"" MIL says it's hard to pronounce. I say it's not and break it down to sounds (Sur-sha) for MIL. MIL says the English name is easier, and I say that's no use if it's wrong and told MIL that if I heard MIL call her ""Sue"" or correct her speech again then I'd reconsider this setup.

Next video call was last night, MIL immediately greets her as ""Sue"" I then pop my head in again and say ""I warned you"" before hanging up and blocking Ex's skype account.

I ignored the incoming video calls (she used her skype and her and Ex's facebooks) for the rest of the night. Today I woke up to several messages from Ex saying I shouldn't have hung up on MIL like that and I need to unblock the account, then call MIL and apologise. I had a bit of a moan to my cousin who was on my side until I told her I hung up on MIL and says I should apologise for that only.

AITA?

Info: MIL has 2 other children in her life, unsure of her relationship to them, but their names are Iona and Lachlan, both of which she pronounces fine, so this really isn't a case of my daughter's name being ""too hard"".

Edit: fuck it. Her name is Roisin (pronounced Row-sheen). She also goes by Rosie. MIL is insisting on calling her Ruby because when my daughter pronounces ""Ruby"" her accent goes funny and sounds more English.",False,1585431474.0,2020-03-28 14:37:31
AITA for refunding the girl who ruined my best friends wedding?,11891,Not the A-hole,605,fr69m5,1585519122.0,"Hello! So, I was a bridesmaid in a wedding months ago. The bride was pregnant so we didn’t have a bachelorette party and instead, planned one post baby. The girls Venmo’d me their part. We paid for the bride’s share so she paid zero. 

Backstory, there were 5 bridesmaids. One of them, let’s call her Debbie Drama brought her boyfriend as a plus one. He was neither there for the bride or the groom. This wedding was absolutely gorgeous, in a vineyard, open bar, bride and groom paid for the bridal and groomsmen’s hotel for the weekend and a wine tour for us and our plus ones including their family aka BIG MONEY. We got there on a Friday, wedding on Sunday, checkout Monday. Debbie and boyfriend were both there the whole weekend.

Well come wedding day, Debbie’s boyfriend gets everybody’s attention right after bride’s dad made a heartfelt speech, and uses that time to propose to Debbie. TACKY TACKY CRINGE CRINGE. Everyone was shocked and furious, which is obviously justified. B&G have a verbal altercation with Debbie and Debbie’s boyfriend and tell them to check out and leave mid wedding. They’re no longer friends, still. 

So back to the bachelorette weekend. I get a call saying the trip has been cancelled and I’m getting a refund and credits for future use. I forwarded the email to the 5 bridesmaids and bride, so they can read about it. I get a call from the bride furious that I’m giving Debbie her money back and travel credits. I told her I’d be giving Debbie back her money but not credits. She says I shouldn’t give her anything because she ruined her wedding. I technically blame her boyfriend and not Debbie per se but I also never liked Debbie so it’s whatever to me. I told the bride she doesn’t get a say in this because she’s not paying for the trip. The bride almost feels like her and her husband are due the money, although she hasn’t directly asked for it. There’s definitely an implication though. I have no clue what the right thing to do is but I’m going to give Debbie back her money. Does that make me an asshole?

p.s. worth it to say, Debbie hasn’t tried to reach out to any of us, or asked me about the trip since the wedding.

EDIT: a couple things worth mentioning. Debbie was not in on the proposal but she is not remorseful. Debbie told the bride and groom that (this isn’t verbatim but close to what she said) “you guys should be proud and flattered that you got to be apart of my proposal instead of being selfish C*NTS.” After he proposed, she instructed the photog to take pics, then pulled him out into a vineyard thing to take pictures of them as an engagement shoot. The B&G had to pull them aside and tell them how tacky what they were doing was. They argued then they ended up asking them to leave. 

It’s also worth it to note that Debbie is the groom’s step sister. They are not close at all the parents got married when they were adults. Debbie was good friends with the bride in childhood and the bride asked her to be a bridesmaid in good faith since she was marrying her step brother.

Also, we jokingly said, as penance, we should all show up to Debbie’s wedding in wedding dresses 😂 what do you guys think?

** thank you guys! Money has been returned, all is right with the world. I showed the bride some of this thread and she’s no longer upset about me giving the money back. She realises she overreacted a tad. They all decided to be the bigger people and then cut Debbie and her douche out of their lives.

AITA for refusing to move my dog from her armchair so my disabled cousin could sit down?,11888,Not the A-hole,1482,equynb,1579460239.0,"My grandma and mom asked if they could host a party at my place which happened yesterday. The reason why they asked for my place is because it’s centrally located to all my family members and it’s a home that’s been in the family for generations (I inherited it) so everybody is familiar with it. 

Now I have an old girl, Sierra, and she’s 11 years old. She has arthritis and one *really* bad hip, but she’s a golden so obviously she wants to be right in everybody’s business and see what’s going on even though she can’t really walk around without being in pain anymore. 

I got her a really huge armchair from goodwill and it’s basically super wide so she can comfortably sit on it. It’s covered in dog hair and scratches and slobber and she loves it. No one else sits on it apart from her. Now sorry for TMI but I reinforce training my dog to sit in that chair because sometimes she has accidents and I sometimes have pads down on the chair, usually it’s predictable times such as the evening, BUT if I was to move her to the couch where she knows she isn’t allowed for the party that might confuse her. 

My cousin has always been big her entire life but in the last few years she has become very very big. She she needs to use scooters to get around and she has a disabled placard etc. She arrived at the party and after a few moments looking around she decided she wanted my dogs armchair because it’s wide. 

I said no that’s sierras armchair, she was currently sitting in it and enjoying the attention everyone was giving her, and I have 3 couches 1 of which was taken up by kids. I said let the kids move to chairs from the dinner table and you can sit on the couch.

Because the couch is a little lower than the armchair I guess she said no, move your dog. She got rude and pushy, but I was absolutely not moving my in pain old age dog when there’s somewhere for my cousin to sit anyway. I even explained about the puppy pads and she was like just move your fucking dog I’m in pain and can’t stand! 

Some family members were strongly in agreement of her, and my mom and grandma were strongly in agreement with me, however it kind of cast a awkward light on the party because she kept loudly cursing at my dog every few moments and waving her arms around to try and scare Sierra off the armchair. Luckily my dog was unimpressed but the whole thing was pretty stressful.",False,False,2020-01-19 10:57:19

AITA for throwing out my gf's jars,11863,Asshole,2032,g3mt16,1587242096.0,"Throwaway because I know she likes to read relationship boards sometimes.

I(42m) moved in with my lovely gf(28f) a few months ago, before this craziness started, and we'd been dating for a year before that . She's an excellent cook and really funny, so life with her has been great but since this incident she's been snappy at me and lost some of her perkiness and good humor.

She always liked to mix ""fancy drinks"" in big Mason jars to drink around the house. Now mind you, I've actually been a bartender before, her drinks are not fancy. They're not even drinks. She usually just squeezes a lemon and puts some ice on her water, or she makes green tea and cools it in the fridge with mint or wtv. And the jars usually come from some grocery or the other, she saves jars from bulk peanut butter, bean jars, whatever has a big glass jar she's going to end up saving it to drink from it.

Before moving in I'd asked about the jars cuz I thought it really strange. I mean, she owns normal glasses. Her justification was that the jars are bigger and therefore she doesn't forget to drink water throughout the day. At the time, I kind of assumed this was some weight loss thing she didn't want to actually tell me because she was embarrassed, as she's a little bit chubby, so I let it go.

But now I've moved in, the jars were annoying me more and more. She doesn't keep every one of them, but she has like ten in their own shelf, and it seems like such a stupid waste of space in our small kitchen. Besides, we have glasses. She doesn't have to drink from a jar. So this earlier this week I was tidying up the kitchen while she slept in and I just... Threw them out.

I think the kitchen looks much better, we have more storage for pots and she can still prepare her ""fancy drinks"" in normal glasses. She was pissed. I never seen her so mad. Her main point were that the jars never bothered anyone and it's none of my business, but now I live here too so I think it is. During the fight, and this is where I may be the AH, I mentioned that it's stupid to want special recipients to just drink flavored water, it's not like it's a cocktail and she's only doing it to lose weight anyway. 

She went really quiet at that and walked away from me. I gave her time to get over it but it's been a few days and she's still moping around, and I noticed she doesn't seem excited about her ""fancy"" drinks... That's making me feel kind of bad, but I still think I was in the right to throw out her jars, as they were just garbage.

AITA For Speaking English With My China Relatives Who Refused To Speak Mandarin,11835,Not the A-hole,1752,cpreva,1565722056.0,"Background here. I am a 16 year old born with China parents and a China born sister who is 23 now. My parents migrated overseas to where we live now with my sister and had me, completely born in an English speaking environment. I can speak Mandarin, but usually only at home, and I study in a school with English as first language. 


We went to my father's hometown in Szechuan Chengdu last month, and welcomed by our grandparents who threw a big reunion party with my uncles aunts and cousins, about 20+ people. They speak in Szechuan dialect as their mother tongue, but are able to understand and speak Mandarin too. While my parents(obviously) and sister(able to understand but can only speak Mandarin) are comfortable with it, I have trouble understanding the dialect.


I tried to ask an uncle speaking to me to speak Mandarin, but was responded with laughter, the other relatives also seemed to enjoy my confusion. That uncle, using Mandarin, told me that I am a banana who has forgotten her roots before turning back to dialect. My parents told me not to act selfishly and expect everyone to change for me. It was awkward and frustrating to be the only one in a house of strangers(yups, relatives but strangers) who had no idea what others were saying. 


Since they were comfortable, I figured I might as well as make myself comfortable too. When an aunt came to speak to me again, I responded in English, this time enjoying her confused face. Even though I had no idea what they were talking about, I spoke English throughout the rest of the party.


I had an earful from my parents after that, they said that I was disrespectful and a walking form of embarassment and because of me they got scolded from my grandparents for teaching me to behave this way. My sister(secretly) supported me though, saying they had what was coming for teasing me like that. AITA?",False,False,2019-08-13 11:47:36

I (29m) prefer going to bed wearing pajama top and pants. I always have as it's just more comfortable for me and I get cold. However, my boyfriend (30m) hates it. He only wears boxers to bed, but we sleep in the same bed.

He's asked me multiple times to just wear boxers like him and he says it's ""frigid and childish"".

So I went to bed last night with a sore stomach. Without going into to much detail, odd been constipated for awhile now. When I woke up, nature finally called and she  wasn't ready to be put on hold. I got up and was on my way to the bathroom when I heard my gf screaming from the  living room. I quickly ran there to see what was going on just to find out it was two fucking spiders (they were sort of big) keeping to themselves by the TV stand. I told her calm down and that I would deal with after I'm done then walked back to the bathroom to do the deed. 

Right in the middle of taking a shit, my gf knocks repeatedly on the bathroom door now literally crying about how they moved closer to the couch. I get she was scared but the shit was literally halfway out so I told her to just lock herself in the bedroom until I'm done. After it was all done (roughly 15 minutes), I came out and relocated the spiders outside onto the balcony then went to tell my gf. Problem is, she wasn't in the room. I pretty much looked everywhere for her until I finally called her and she answered really angry talking about how shitty and useless I am. Turns out she packed a bag and left to stay with her parents. Wtf? She literally had walk past these *dangerous* spiders to get to the door. I apologized though but she's still not having it and even her mother has chipped her 2c in about how pathetic a boyfriend I am.

"AITA for running through neighborhoods in the early morning, making security lights come on and dogs bark?",11771,Not the A-hole,2711,db3x19,1569833167.0,"I (26F) like to go for a run in the morning before I go to work. I usually set out around 5:00 AM so I can make sure to get at least 5 miles in at a time before having to get ready for work. Well depending on the time of year, I'm either running around sunrise or wrap up before, which means that people in the neighborhood have those security lights that pop up if you're in the area.

Well people started complaining about their lights being triggered and their dogs flipping out at early times, and people on their stupid doorbell cameras will look at people going by and several people posted videos of me running by. I'm identifiable because I have a headlamp and flashers to make sure cars see me.

This was on that Nextdoor app so I chimed in to say hey, sorry about that! And got dogpiled by people telling me to change up my route, or have more respect. Some people told me to go to a gym, why don't I run in the afternoon or evening etc etc. I told them I had no way of remembering whose house has what lights or what dogs and that it's just something we all have to deal with. I'm not going around complaining about the sprinklers that come on and drench me because they aren't calibrated right! And then said that I love to run in the morning because it makes me feel good through the day to which someone said ""Yeah try getting woken up by some smartass who won't be neighborly enough to just go to the gym!""

Anyway I've gotten some really nasty notes and people keep posting videos of me and comments saying that I should really get a gym membership and other people calling me rude because the dog barks and wakes up the baby or something. I don't enjoy running on a treadmill. Never have, never will. Besides why pay out the ass to be leered at and hit on by gross dudes when I can run in the darkness and watch the sun rise? Seems like a no-brainer, right?

My best friend has suggested I just head out later, but I won't have enough time for the rest of my routine (shower, breakfast, etc) if I do that.

ETA: Tried to grab all the INFO questions. 

1 - There are no parks nearby large enough for me to run in. The only one around here is about one block, and it is surrounded by houses. I pass this park already. There are no ""trail systems"" or anything like that either. 

2 - I don't run the same exact path every day. No matter which street I run on, there's inevitably security lights and dogs. I have 5 or 6 different routes I'll take. I don't think it's even the same dogs barking at me on those routes. 

3 - I don't have a car, so I can't just drive out somewhere else. 

4 - Again, I'm not getting a gym membership. My budget doesn't include that kind of luxury, and the closest affordable gym here is about 6 miles away to begin with. 

5 - I can't run later in the morning. I have to be out the door at a certain time to get my full 5 miles in.  5:00-630, exercise (warm up and cool down included). 6:30-7:30, getting ready (shower, coffee, breakfast, put together lunch or it's already made, makeup, hair, getting dressed). If I don't leave for the bus at 7:45, I will not get to work on time.

AITA for completely refusing to let my ex-girlfriend give our baby up for adoption?,11743,Not enough info,2909,fdcgi8,1583354609.0,"My ex-girlfriend and I had been dating for 4 years but ~6 months ago we broke up — not on bad terms, but long story short we just both realised that we weren’t heading in the same direction.

Shortly after that, she found out she was pregnant. We talked about how we would handle things, and both agreed to JUST be friends and parents to our baby, despite the unexpectedness we both were (and I still am) very excited. We EXPLICITLY agreed platonic parent relationship only.

We started getting quite close and hanging out a lot again, which I thought nothing of — after all, we ended on good terms and we were going to be friends and coparents so it made sense.

One night at my house she tried to kiss and I stopped it in its tracks as I was not comfortable. I told her I wasn’t interested in a relationship at all and just wanted to focus on myself and our baby.

She got quite angry and started shouting at me, asking why I would have a baby with her if I didn’t want to be with her, how could I do this to her, etc.

I just told her I was clear about this from the very beginning, and I asked her to leave and we could talk tomorrow.

The next day she told me she didn’t want to have a baby out of a relationship and that she was getting an abortion. Unfortunately she found out she was too far along and informed me we would be giving up the baby for adoption. I flat out told her no way I would not let her do that at all — which is where I might be the asshole.

She came to my house very angry and again asked how I could do this to her. This is where I might be the asshole (again) because I told her that SHE is the one who CHOSE to have this baby and I was clear about my stance from the beginning. If she misinterpreted my stance or was deluded enough to convince herself otherwise then that was on HER not me.

She screamed that she was breaking up with me (even though we were already broken up). She talked to my parents and sister and now they are mad at me as they really like my ex and “how can i do this to her” — and her parents came to my house crying and begging me to give it up for adoption.

Over the past few weeks I have probably been asked 10,000 times how can I do this to her. I told her dad (who had since come to my doorstep ~5 more times) that I’m not doing anything to her, and if he asks me that one more time i’m going to write it on a piece of paper and shove it up his ass, before getting a restraining order (part three of where I might have been the asshole). That was mainly a result of my frustration from being harassed, but I am not trying to excuse it as I know he was just trying to help his daughter.

At first I thought I was overwhelmingly in the right and that they were the wrong ones, but now everyone has me questioning everything. I know it sucks for her but I genuinely if she didn’t want a baby out of a relationship she should have had an abortion when that was available.

It bothers me a lot, I grew up in a rough home and I don't like that environment, of screaming and cussing and anger in my home. 

I've told my boyfriend this, and he says he's not really mad, it's just a game, it's just the way he connects with his friends who are competitive people. But TBH it bothers me a lot. 

Last week, I had been napping and I heard a holler and I was immediately woken, and feeling panicked. I of course quickly remembered where I was, but I was upset. I really just don't want those energies in my home.

I went downstairs and told my boyfriend to stop hollering at home, because it's stressing me out. And he kinda brushed it off. 

Later that night, I called my friend and as a joke, said I should just have a yell with her. And she was all for it.  She went out to the woods behind her house and also grabbed her roommate on the way.

It was kinda silly at first, yelling over Skype. But we kinda got into it, my friend was yelling about some shit her boss said, and her roommate and I were yelling back ""Fuck that, girl you need a new job"" and stuff. It was kind of hard to keep from laughing and we kept dissolving into giggles. 

It devolved into one of us shrieking like a maniac, everyone dying laughing, and then repeating.

My boyfriend came upstairs at that point, he'd been sitting outside and smoking, and he asked what the hell was going on.

I was like ""I'm calling my friends, thought we'd try having a scream. Seemed like a fun way to socialize."" 

He was telling me off saying that hearing women's screaming is gonna make someone worried, and I was like ""oh no I'm sure it's fine, screaming into a mic is just normal socializing, right?"" 

We talked later and he said he didn't want me pulling that shit again because it freaked him the hell out to hear me screaming, and I was just like ""OK, so do you finally get it? I feel freaked out when you bring that energy into the house too.""

And he said he didn't think it was the same; he and his friends normally socialize like that, me and my friends were being crazy to make a point.

I said that I had a lot of fun having a yell on the call, it felt good, and if he wanted to keep bringing that energy into the house, I'd be doing it too. But if he didn't want that kinda energy around, we could stop it together.

He called me ridiculous for this, and yeah I know it's kinda petty but I also think I have a point. If he doesn't like me screaming in the house, he should understand I don't like him screaming in the house.

They are fully consenting adults, therefore they do things that I don't want to think about.

They always shower/bathe together, and because the bathroom shares a wall with my bedroom and the kitchen, no matter where I go in the flat I hear exactly what they're doing. Then the shower stops running and my brother leaves, and exactly 10 minutes later, often to the exact second, the girlfriend leaves. She spends the 10 minute interim playing games on her phone.

The reason for this is that she doesn't want me to see them leave the bathroom together. She is unaware of the sound issue and thinks that I have no idea they even entered the bathroom together, and hopes that 10 minutes will be enough for me to believe that my brother had his shower and left and then she entered and had hers separately.

However, this 10 minute pause between them finishing in the bathroom and her leaving the bathroom is a real pain in the arse. They always do this either early in the morning when I need to shower and leave for work, or right at the end of the night when I need to do my nighttime routine before bed.

WIBTA if I said to her ""look, I know what you're doing in there, I don't have a problem with it as you're fully consenting adults, but the time you wait between him leaving and you leaving is a real pain, so can you just leave together, or at least shorten the time?""",False,False,2020-01-26 13:11:04
"AITA for ""trying to control"" my gf's money?",11724,Not the A-hole,1726,gi3h9g,1589284207.0,"I, 29, hate debt. It's nothing but a weight around your ankles to keep you from moving ahead with your life. I was lucky enough to get scholarships for most of college, and paid off the loans I did have to get ASAP. I did go ahead and buy a new car for the increased safety features, but only have a few thousand left on that loan, because again, aggressive paying it off. I just bought a house because a mortgage is half of what my old apartment rent was, but I plan on being aggressive with this too, and hopefully have it paid off in a fraction of the time. Long story shit, I fucking hate debt. Makes me very anxious and feel physically sick. 

My gf, 29, on the other hand, has a ton of debt, and doesn't really care. She has student loans, her car, and her credit card, and is making the bare minimum payments so she has extra money to play with each month.

Because I do love her, and could theoretically see myself spending my life with her, I made her a deal - she could live in my house, rent, grocery, and utility free, until her debts were all paid off. With her salary, it would take her about 1.5 years to pay it all off if she put the max amount she could towards them. It would then become our house, and she would help take half of the payments so we could be on a more equal footing. She accepted this without question, and we even sat down to look over her finances, budget, pay stubs, everything, so we could make a comprehensive plan. 

Well, the other day her cell rang while she was in the shower, so I picked it up. Turns out, it's a debt collector! I confronted her about this when she got out and dressed, since it's been a few months and she should have been able to pay off at least the smallest loan in full, and it turns out she just stopped paying everything! Let everything go into default, since ""You'll just pay it when we're married."" 

I then made it _very_ clear that we werent getting married anytime soon, not until her debt was gone, and she knows my stance on keeping long term debt. This upset her, she started yelling at me, and I made it very clear she had three options - follow our deal and pay off her debt, pay me back for the last few months I've apparently funded her lifestyle, or leave and go stay with her brother. Huffy, she packed a bag and left, saying we'd talk about this later when I'd ""calmed down."" I made it clear there was nothing to talk about, and I'd have her stuff packed by morning. 

The last few hours, however, her entire family's called, our mutual friends have called, everyone's called to put in their two cents on how I was being too controlling with her money. I see it as her being a freeloader, especially since she knows my anxieties around being in large amounts of debt (parents lost everything in '08, we were homeless for a year, I refuse to do that again). AITA here?

Update: I've got some friends coming over after work to help me take the rest of her stuff over to her brother's house.

AITA for competing in a mother and son race with my stepson?,11715,Not the A-hole,831,gbgytz,1588363946.0,"My stepson is 11 and at his school they have these annual events (father-son camping, mother-daughter cooking etc). Late last year they held a mother and son race where the mother had to run across the field and piggy back their sons back to the other side and then tie our legs together and just sprint back across. 

A week prior my stepson Dylan was talking about it and how he thought it was ridiculous and embarrassing. When I looked at their poster for it, it looked fun so I convinced him to sign up for it. Later that day I called his mother Julie but she didn't pick up so I left a voicemail talking about the event and asking her to get back to us if she is available. Five days past and still no word from her. Being honest when she didn't respond, I saw it as an opportunity for Dylan and I to bond but since I respect Julie as his mother I sent her an email (doesn't use social media) with the poster and talking about how Dylan has signed up for it. Two days passed and still nothing. So I went to Dylan and told him that his mother hadn't gotten back to me but if he was okay with it, I was willing to step in since it was too late to pull out. He was a bit disappointed but still fine.

The day came and it was a blast. Tiresome but definitely worth it. It was just so much fun and I made a few friends there who were also stepmothers. And obviously we won 1st place and got two medals. Dylan also enjoyed it and feels way more comfortable with me now.

While I was browsing the school's website last week, I saw a picture from that day with me running and Dylan cheering on my back. It was a cute picture so I downloaded it and made it my profile picture. Turns out one of Julie's friends showed her the picture and now she's going on a rant about how I shouldn't have done that and how I've overstepped my mark as his step mother. When I told her I called her and sent an email she went on saying that I should've sent her a text or called her again instead of just once. AITA?

AITA for refusing to cook the kind of food my husband wants?,11709,Not the A-hole,1885,g4saq8,1587416276.0,"So let me preface this by saying that I was overweight when I met my husband. Also, before I started working from home, I (F28) didn’t really care about how healthy our meals were. I cooked comfort food most of the time with little thought regarding calories and my husband (M41) loved everything I made. I think it’s part of the reason he fell for me to be honest. Since I started working from home I now have an extra two hours a day (as I’m no longer commuting) and have used it to start exercising. 

My family has a history of high blood pressure and it hit home for me just recently that it’s time to get in shape. My husband was supportive at first but as I’ve started to really lose weight he’s become less so. He’s always bringing home junk food, which would be fine if he wanted it just for himself, but he tries to pressure me into eating it as well.

My husband is a mailman and walks 15 miles a day so he’s in better shape than I am. His dinners used to consist of two or three helpings of whatever unhealthy food I made that day. Lately I’ve been making healthier choices when it comes to our food. My husband can’t cook to save his life and the grocery shopping and all cooking is done by me. When I say healthier choices I don’t mean tofu and kale, I mean that I’ve started cooking our favorite foods but with healthier alternatives, like using 1% milk instead of heavy cream and adding veggies.

Since I’ve started doing this my husband has doubled his efforts in trying to get me to stop working on my health. He still has his normal two to three helpings so the food can’t taste that bad. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even share with him anymore if I reached a new goal because he gets all surly.

It all came to a head last night when I made a casserole and added broccoli and used a lighter sauce. He flipped out and said I’m trying to push my “get better looking” agenda off on him even though my efforts to get in shape have nothing to do with how I look. He then accused me of being sick of him and using my workouts as an excuse to get away from him, which is completely untrue. I enjoy our time together and my workouts right now are only about 40 minutes because it’s all I can manage so I’m not leaving him alone that long.

He then said that he would drop it if I would go back to cooking and eating the way I used to. I told him that he was more than welcome to cook the way he wanted but he refused and left in a huff.

While he was gone I called my sister to try to get some perspective. She sided with my husband and said I was being TA by not providing him with the “fuel” he needs for his physically intensive job (even though the food I’m making now is more nutrient dense than it was before) and that just because cooking was one of my tasks in the relationship didn’t mean I should be the only one with any say in how things are made.

WIBTA for sending my stepmum a rude floral arrangement?,11702,Not the A-hole,1549,gcj097,1588502040.0,"My dad just proposed to his girlfriend. I truly, genuinely, did not know she didn't drink. The only time I've spent with her where a drink would typically be ordered are times that we've gone for coffee, so I've never been in a situation with her where she had the choice to order alcohol and she's never mentioned it. So because I didn't know she didn't drink, I sent them champagne.

I got a phone call and an earful from dad with her audibly sobbing in the background. Dad wants me to make it up to her. On the call I heard her say ""ask that dyke how-"" and then the sound went muffled so I think dad covered the phone, but that's not even close to the first time she's called me that.

My stepmother loves flower langauge, as in what certain flowers represent and the meaning of each flower. I have done some rage googling and now have the knowledge required to create a bouquet that quite literally says ""fuck you"".

I told my girlfriend what I was planning and she's said it's a great idea... right up until my stepmum tells my dad what the flowers mean.

WIBTA for sending the rude flowers?

&#x200B;

Info: flowers are geraniums (stupidity), yellow carnations (disappointment /disdain), orange lilies (hatred), petunias (resentment/anger) and baby's breath, which doesn't have a bad message but it you look at them the wrong way then you'll be cleaning up petals for a year.

I have talked to dad numerous times about her calling me (and my girlfriend) dykes and his response is that she makes him happy so why can't I just be happy for him and that it's not like she'll call me that all the time, just every now and again when she sees me. I'm still in contact because I have 2 underage siblings living with them full time who I want to stay in touch with but I plan to cut contact with dad and stepmum after my siblings are old enough to facilitate a relationship with me outside of them.

Edit: No glitter bombs. My friend got one in the post once and some got in her eye and hurt her. Not risking that. Also anyone who thinks a glitter bomb will stop her calling me a dyke has not dealt with people like her.",False,1588515628.0,2020-05-03 03:34:00
WIBTA if I go to HR over Jesus propaganda at work?,11695,Not the A-hole,1750,dodf1r,1572318022.0,"EDIT: Thanks y'all! I'm not going to talk to any higher-ups unless something like this happens again. I've read many helpful comments and many ridiculous ones, the only thing I feel I need to clarify is that I keep my joking about religious iconography confined to ranty posts on the internet. In fact I just avoid talking about religion in general unless it's with my husband, since most of my nearest and dearest are Christians as well. Some of you also got the reference, so thanks for not immediately accusing me of being one of ""those atheists""! 

So last night at work, it was pretty clear that my manager was stressed out/in a bad mood. During our startup meeting, she was discussing how much work we had to do, improvements we needed to make, and the fact that no one was meeting production goals. Next week is the beginning of peak season, so essentially she was telling us to get our shit together. After her speech, an older lady who was working overtime and from another shift, said, ""After all that we need some good news! I've got some good news for y'all!"" 

When my manager asked her what the good news was, she said, ""Jesus is coming back!"" Now, I found this pretty annoying, but it has less to do with the fact that I'm an atheist and more to do with us being at *work*. I'm used to people inappropriately inserting jesus into random conversations or assuming everyone around them is a Christian (born and raised in Georgia), so I rolled my eyes but knew there was no point in voicing my opinion. Plus, my manager responded with, ""Amen,"" along with one of my coworkers. Safe to say there were more people on the older lady's side than mine. 

This is where it gets worse and where I actually got offended, or rather uncomfortable. After the meeting, when we were all getting our equipment out and getting to our various stations, the older lady came up to me. Only me, from what I saw. She stuck out her hand to give me some Jesus propaganda, and when I tried to refuse (nicely, all I said was no thank you in a pleasant tone), she insisted and said that I needed it. I'm assuming she saw me roll my eyes at her comment during startup. 

I really did not appreciate this at all, and her singling me out like that changed my mind on the whole ""no point in voicing my opinion"" thing. My husband, who works at the same place in another department, was also pretty pissed about it. 

I don't think there's much point in asking my manager to talk to this lady, because she is very much a Christian judging by her southern curly-scripted bible verse T shirts and her lowercase T necklace. My husband says I should bring this up to HR so that someone can tell this lady how not okay it is to confront someone with religion in the workplace.

AITA for not wanting to look after my unborn brother?,11686,Not the A-hole,1439,g6cl3r,1587629416.0,"Sorry this is a long one!!

Ok so I’m (19F) and my dad and his wife had been talking about wanting a kid together for a couple years and last year they finally went through IVF and she’s due in June, yay! I’m a full time uni student I’ve been living at home with them and leading up to their decision my dad was constantly asking if I was ok with having a sibling. Tbh I didn’t didn’t feel it was my place to even say anything. They’re a couple and if they want a kid then cool. 

Anyway, about 3-4 months or so ago my dad started making jokes about delegating the sucky jobs to me, like diaper changing and staying up till the insane hours of the morning with him and babysitting, etc. and I laughed a lot of it off because he has a very strange sense of humour, but in the last month or so he started getting annoyed when I did? It wasn’t until one day we had a conversation about the baby being a handful and he said “well since you don’t have to pay board and only work 3 days a week you can just quit your job and babysit so we can have a break.” Of course I thought this was a joke because there’s no way he could be serious but then he got mad and said “well you will have to look after him, he’s your brother and this is how family works”

Now this didn’t sit right with me and so I said “no I still have expenses like my phone bill, paying for transport to get to uni and work, and the fact that I have a student loan” he didn’t really respond and just walked away. Ever since he’s been saying stuff like “you can afford to take a couple days off uni if we need it right?” and “this is what being an adult is about, you look after family, don’t you love your brother?”

I’ve honestly gotten really sick of the expectation that since they’re having a kid I have to drop everything for it so “they can have a break”. I believe once you create that responsibility you don’t get a break for 18yrs, and if I wanted to parent a child and put my life on hold I would’ve made the same decision my mother did and would have had one at 17 (we have a very rocky relationship if any at all).

Till now I have put my foot down that it’s not my kid and not my responsibility, and I’m happy to help out as long as it suits my work and uni schedule, but the rest of my family have started calling me a brat and that family looks after each other. Since my parents were super young when they had me they had so much help from my grandparents and aunt that I almost considered myself raised by them rather than my own parents, from this I kind of feel like my dads expecting this to happen again with my brother. I always believed I was in the right but now my entire family is disagreeing with me, even my aunt who is always the voice of reason and now I’m wondering if I am being selfish.

TLDR: my dad and his wife expect me to put my work and uni on hold to look after my brother once he’s born so they can have a break. AITA for saying no?",False,False,2020-04-23 01:10:16
AITA for asking my boyfriend to stop wearing suits outside of work?,11695,Asshole,861,h0ghw3,1591841451.0,"I know this sounds weird, but here goes:

I have been dating my (47F) boyfriend (52M) for two years. We met in a grief counseling group after losing our spouses. Everything in this relationship has been great - our kids get along great; I even got a Mother's Day card from his son thanking me for making his dad smile again. It was sweet.

My daughter (19F) adores my boyfriend. I was surprised how fast they hit it off because she's very shy, but I didn't want to question it, so I let it go. But as time went on, things got weird.

On Valentine's Day, he got me a bouquet and a rose for her, and she still has it hanging in her room. She gets up early every morning to make him a latte, and every night when he gets home, she's waiting in the kitchen with a beer and a sandwich for him. He has back problems so she bought him a computer chair with massaging rollers on it, which pissed me off because I am a MASSEUSE. I can take care of this man's back just fine. I refuse to replaced by an effing chair.

I asked my daughter why she keeps doing this stuff, and she said she just likes him. I asked why to see if I could get more info, and she started listing things - he's nice, smart, funny, blah blah blah, but what stuck out was when she said she loves the way he dresses.

My boyfriend is a funeral director, so he always wears black suits. When I first started dating him, my daughter would always call him ""sharp dressed man"", saying things like ""Are you gonna go see that sharp dressed man again?"" or ""When do I get to meet your new sharp dressed man, Mom??"" My daughter always says she wants to ""marry a man in a suit"" so I assumed this was her way of showing approval.

But now I'm starting to wonder if there's more. I've been wanting to suggest that he stop wearing suits outside work, but he loves his suits. We just a bought a house together and I know he's been looking at rings (this man is a chess champions who speaks six languages, yet doesn't know how to close his laptop when going to the bathroom lol), so I'm invested in this relationship. I love this man and I want to marry him, but I'm afraid if I tell him what's on my mind he'll kick my daughter out.

This all came to head last night when we were watching a movie, and she went up to get drinks. When she came back, she handed my boyfriend his beer, and then . . . tried to sit in his lap. I say ""tried"" because my boyfriend pushed her off and angrily told her that what she did was inappropriate. He stormed up to our bedroom, and I followed him up to talk to him. He started saying that my daughter should start looking elsewhere to stay, but I told him about the suit thing, and that maybe if he just wore normal clothes outside work, she wouldn't act so weird. He told me I was being ridiculous and we went to bed.

I made him breakfast this morning, but he left to go eat instead. He says he's in the McDonald's parking lot now, but we're going to have a serious talk when he gets home. I don't know what to think. AITA?

---------------------------------------------

Update on our conversation - well it turns out some of you were right and there was a lot of crap I didn't know about. An entire shitshow's worth, in fact. My boyfriend showed me several disturbing text messages (no actual propositioning or anything, just weird stuff like ""I miss you"" and ""are you awake?"" at 2 AM, etc.), and apparently my daughter had confided in him about a ""close friendship"" she had with her basketball coach right after her dad died. My boyfriend said he kept it a secret because she begged him not to tell me and he didn't want to break her trust. I, of course, was incredibly hurt to hear this, but at the same time I understand why he didn't tell me.

Apparently he is the only person she has ever talked to about this. It turns out my daughter has basically been treating my boyfriend like a private therapist for the past several months, and he didn't tell me because he wanted to help her. He chalked up all the favors to her just showing gratitude for lending an ear, and didn't realize how she might have felt differently before last night. He apologized for insisting on kicking her out, and I apologized for the stupid comments about his suits. It was a comment I made out of being in denial, and now I realize she needs therapy. When I first started grief counseling I did ask my kids if they wanted counseling. They both said no, and I didn't want to force it on them.

When I sat my daughter down to talk about the boundary issue, she burst into tears and started apologizing. I had an extremely uncomfortable, but necessary conversation with her, and I told her that I'm going to start looking for a therapist. I didn't tell her that I know about the basketball coach because I don't want her to feel betrayed, and I'm hoping a professional will be able to get it out of her in a more sensitive and controlled manner. But so help me  God if that motherfucker ever shows his face in my hometown again and she asks me why I'm in jail, I guess I'll have to tell her I know about it then. 

But for now, her healing from the past is my main priority, because it really does seem like her dad screwed her up far worse than I thought. My boyfriend and I have made up, and no one is getting kicked out, but things are still pretty awkward. She's basically quarantined herself in the basement. For now we all just need some space, and my boyfriend has already helped me find some good therapists in our area.",False,1591839353.0,2020-06-10 19:10:51

She keeps nicking my bath products, shampoo, body butter/scrub, lotions, ect, which are the only thing I really spend out on. I buy my stuff when I need it and most of the remaining money goes untouched.  I usually get a floral or fruit scent like rose or pomegranate but I like strawberry and never buy it because of her allergies.

I've told her multiple times to stop taking my stuff but she still goes into my room and takes it so lately as stuff has been running out I've been replacing it with the exact same thing but the strawberry version. Basically everything I own now contains strawberry in some way. Everything is clearly labelled but earlier my sister went into my room and without looking at the label used some strawberry hand lotion and now her hands itch.

She and mum have both cussed me out saying I can't have this stuff in the house but I maintain that if she didn't go into my room and take my things this wouldn't be a problem.

AITA?

Info: I pay out for the fancy stuff that contains actual strawberries, not the cheaper stuff that just has the scent, which is why her hands are itchy, because she basically squirted strawberry juice on them.

AITA for embarrassing my daughter by asking her not to flush her pads down the toilet?,11661,Not the A-hole,1444,hbdmnj,1592511945.0,"I’m 38m and my daughter Chloe is 10. Chloe recently started her period. I discovered this after I went into the bathroom a few days ago and found a used sanitary pad floating in the toilet. I knew it had to be left there by Chloe, since my wife uses tampons (and also throws them in the bin where they belong.)

Shortly after I came out of the bathroom, I saw Chloe sitting in the living room playing on her phone. My wife was out visiting her sister at the time, and since I didn’t know when she was getting back, I figured I might as well talk to Chloe about it right away. I said something like: “Hey kiddo, I found a pad in the toilet. From now on, I’d like to ask you to fold them into a piece of toilet paper and put them in the trash. It’s OK that it happened this one time, but it could cause problems for the toilet if it happens again.”

Chloe turned bright red and screamed “Oh my god!” while jumping off the couch and bolting into the bathroom. A moment later, she came running back into the living room and asked, “Where is it? I just looked in the toilet and I don’t see it at all!” I explained to her that I had already fished it out with a bit of tissue and thrown it away. She fell completely silent and looked at me like I had two heads.

I assured her that it was not a big deal, just please remember to throw it in the bin next time. She looked very embarrassed and went into her room and didn’t come out until dinner. When my wife returned home later on, she noticed that Chloe was acting a little funny, and asked me if something had happened while she was out. To my surprise, she became very upset with me when I told her about the incident.

From my wife’s point of view, Chloe must have been mortified to learn that her father not only found her used pad, but had to fish it out of the toilet. She said that I should have realized how embarrassing it would be for my daughter to hear this from me, and that it was thickheaded to not just wait for my wife to get home and let her deal with it. From my point of view, I think dancing around menstruation like it’s some shameful secret that my daughter shouldn’t be able to acknowledge in front of her own father sends the wrong message. My wife completely disagrees with my framing and thinks I’m being insensitive. Am I in the wrong here?

"AITA for calling a woman a ""dumb cunt"" and telling her to go fuck herself in front of her kids after she told my adopted niece to call me ""aunt""?",11653,Everyone Sucks,9,ffybgv,1583803915.0,"So, my husband said I over reacted and my other ""mom friends"" are tearing each other apart over this.

So, I have 4 kids. 3 of them though are biologically my nieces and nephews. 6 years ago my brother and his wife were killed by a drunk driver. They had 3 kids, at the time they were 10, 7, and 2 years old. Me and my husband decided to take them in and last year we finalized the adoption of all three of them (we held off on this for many reasons).

Suffice to say, our family situation is a rough topic.We have worked extremely hard with the two older children and made sure that they knew we were not trying to just replace their parents. But that's not relevant here. This situation involves my youngest niece. Because of how young she was when we brought her in, she sees me and my husband as her parents. We have never lied to her and told her we were her biological mom or dad. And she knows this, but she still has only ever called me mom. Her and my daughter are also only a year apart in age and see each other as sisters. 

So, yesterday the two of them were invited by a neighbor girl to a birthday party. When we were there, I hung out with the other moms as the kids played. This is where Karen comes in. This was the first time I had met Karen. We had begun talking and she asked me about if niece was adopted (my late sister in law was indian while me and my husband are white, this isnt an uncommon question). I answered truthfully and said she was my adopted niece but I see her no differently than my daughter. Karen gave me the normal ""Wow, your so strong/brave/etc"" and we continued on. 

As the party wound down, my daughter and niece came over repeating ""mom"", asking if they could take home some of the extra cake left over. Karen immediately said ""Honney, she's not your mom, she's your aunt"". I immediately looked at her and asked what she meant by this and she said that ""it's not right for me to confuse her"". 

Me and Karen got into a fight and it got ugly fast. I called her a dumb cunt in front of her daughter and told her to go fuck herself before I went out to smoke. By the time I came back in Karen had left and the other moms either supported me or told me that I was a huge asshole to pull a scene like that. 

When I got home and told my husband he said that I over reacted. He agreed that she was a horrible bitch but that I should not have caused a scene and just ignored her. We also had to sit down and explain to my daughter and niece what happened and why I did what I did. 

After everything though, I feel like I did nothing wrong. AITA?",True,False,2020-03-09 18:31:55
AITA for posting messages exposing my friend as a liar over something that happened at her wedding?,11652,Not the A-hole,1084,eh7csf,1577663293.0,"I’m using a throwaway account because I use my main solely in another sub.

I was invited to an old school friend’s wedding that happened a few days ago. We’re not ride or die, but whenever we’re both in the same region we always meet up.

I ordered a nice yellow jumpsuit for the wedding from a trusted retailer. When it came, it was much paler than the picture, basically a straw yellow. I started to worry as I’d read those stories about guests wanting to steal the thunder by wearing white/traditional wedding dress colours at weddings, and I messaged my friend to ask if she was wearing white. She said she was, and asked why. I sent a picture of the jumpsuit and said that this was what I’d been sent in place of a much brighter colour. She said that it looked fine, and she’d shut anyone up if they tried to make a deal about it on the day.

On the day itself, I didn’t actually get any comments about it directly, which was a relief. However, when I went to the bathroom, I encountered two of the bridesmaids gossiping about how that girl in the jumpsuit (so, me) had the nerve to wear it, especially after the bride had told her directly it wasn’t suitable. To frame this as it happened, I was in a cubicle when they came in and started chatting. I came out of the cubicle, and said that no such conversation had happened, and if the bride really had an issue she should have told me months ago when we talked about it. They basically scoffed and said they’d believe me when they saw the ‘receipts’. I saw them later on in the evening with the bride, and all three of them were giving me the stink eye.

Yesterday, the bride posted a thank you message on Facebook, with the comment that ‘even scene-stealing wannabes’ couldn’t spoil the day. I was going to leave it, but one of the bridesmaids commented with a poorly-taken picture of me from behind with drawn-on devil horns and tail. I reacted on impulse, and posted screenshots of the conversation where the bride had told me that my outfit was fine, with a comment saying that it was a shame that the bride couldn’t tell me to my face there was an issue, and that since I’d been asked for ‘receipts’, here they were. The comment got a few further comments saying that the tea had been spilled and that this is what happens when people don’t know all the facts, as well as the inevitable ones saying that I was being childish and creating a drama.

I do view this as stooping down to the level of those who couldn’t even tell me straight there was an issue (I mean I had another dress in my car just in case I got comments) in how I reacted, but I also think I was defending my reputation and honour among people I’ve known for over two decades. The peace-keeping side of me wants to apologise to the bride, but my heart knows she won’t offer the same olive branch, especially now people know she was two-faced in this situation.",False,False,2019-12-29 15:48:13
AITA for getting pissed that my (now) vegan GF refuses to live with me if I eat meat?,11646,Not the A-hole,2641,d2bg73,1568166964.0,"My gf and I have a child, due to financial issues we haven’t been able to live together until now. She’s been vegan about a year, and wasn’t when we met, I have always been an omnivore and never suggested that would change. Now that we found a place, she now says that she doesn’t want to live with me if I don’t agree to go vegan. I responded with [this](https://i.imgur.com/rd4a9Ck.jpg) after my frustration reach epic levels AITA?

**Edit**: our child is being raised vegan against my wishes but in the interest of compromise I leave it alone and made sure our child eats as complete a diet as possible. 

Currently I only eat meat 2-3 days a week at most. I already agreed not to eat meat around here, my meat eating at “our” place would be limited to when she isn’t there. 

I forgot to mention I have a child from a previous relationship that will be living with us, and that child is expected to go vegan as well.

**Edit 2**: I agree with anyone that says my response was immature and counterproductive.

**Update 1: we spoke and this summarized what I said:**

“Yesterday doesn’t sit well with me, your attitude towards it is controlling, and the fact you’re not willing to even explore compromises is troubling. For instance, the few times I eat or cook meat could be done when you aren’t home, I could get a small bar fridge to store meat, there’s a million solutions that could have been discussed if you really wanted this to work. Your attitude surrounding it is controlling and unreasonable, I am asked to make incredible sacrifices because you’re unable to compromise, or unwilling to. This will become a pattern, because you know I want this more than you, and you won’t have to compromise cause I’ll cave to have our family.

You have a right to state how you feel, as I do. If you choose to ignore my feelings entirely up to you. But the lack of communication about this isn’t going to change anything. I want you and this family, but I’m not rolling over and changing every time you decide you believe in something else, compromise is a two way street, and if we aren’t going to walk it together as equals, in ideas, feelings, respect, and communication, then we say goodbye now. “

**Addition: I feel like I should add this reply I made to a militant vegan here **

~~https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d2bg73/_/ezuc01f/?context=1~~

I replied to the wrong comment and now I can’t find it.

**Update 2:** All she’s said to me is “I’m dreaming of a future that I won’t have. “ not sure what that means but I don’t want to go down any more rabbit holes today. I think I’ll try tomorrow evening to talk to her, I’ll give her time to consider my words abs to collect her thoughts. Right now I want to think about everything that’s been said here, specifically about my younger child being vegan, my family, what’s best for everyone, and most importantly what kind of future do I see with her right now.  I’ve read every comment, and this has turned into a very spirited debate. I believe there’s merit to reducing meat intake for your health and for the environment, but I don’t believe in extreme knee jerk reactions to anything. I have reading to do..

**thoughts:** I am not criticizing vegans, and in the reply (to the wrong comment) that’s causing me to get hate mail, I was referring to a specific subset of vegans, I would have expressed similar sentiments to a religious fanatic that was forcing his or her beliefs to me. 

I support her right to live the life she wants, and to eat what she wants. I want the same accommodation. 

Was I the asshole here? IMHO Yes in some ways I was. Is she the asshole for the ultimatum? Possibly. What I know for sure is I don’t think I’ll ever understand how this “lifestyle” and diet is a reasonable justification to change the nature of the family at its core. 

Some have called me a pushover, that may be true, but I’m trying my best to navigate waters that are unfamiliar to me, and to make the best decisions for me and my family.

I am reading most of your comments, and to those who say I’m being intolerant, I’m not, I’m seeking compromise. To those who say a child should be raised as a vegan, I agree and have from the start, that choice was made unilaterally and the safe guards and information gathering  we agreed to hasn’t happened.",True,1568202273.0,2019-09-10 18:56:04
AITA for making my MIL pay for food I ordered after she ruined the one we had?,11653,Asshole,2311,ctox7d,1566458681.0,"My wife and I were hosting a barbecue on sunday. Half an hour before the guests arrived we were busy preparing food and my MIL was helping us.

While I was busy doing something else I asked my MIL to take the pasta salad I had prepared out of the fridge and taste for seasoning. She said that it needed more salt and I told her to add it, but not use the big salt shaker we have, because too much comes out of it. She used it anyways and oversalted the dish. I was really angry and tried to fix it with more mayo but it just didn't taste good. I told my MIL that I would have to order a new pasta salad from a local place, which she said wasn't necessary but I did anyways. About 15 minutes after the guests arrived I see the delivery guy at our front door. I tell my MIL to get up and she asks why. I tell her that the delivery guy is here so she can pay him. She looks at me stunned and asks ""why should I pay him"". So I have to expain that because she ruined the pasta salad she has to pay for the new one. She finally gets up to pay him but it's incredibly awkward and my wife is giving me the death stare. The guests seem kinda awkward too and my MIL didn't talk to me at all for the rest of the party.

After the guests were gone my wife flipped her shit at me. She called me an imbecile and an asshole and said that I embarassed myself and damaged the realationship to her mother. It's been three days and she's still angry about this. AITA?

Edit: Ok, I think the judgement has been clear. I will try to fix it, although I'm not sure yet how to.

AITA for telling my manager that if her pregnancy is effecting her decision making then she shouldn't be in her position?,11618,Not the A-hole,711,eq7q69,1579329396.0,"Some context: I am a 27F working in a factory, my position involves sorting mail and dealing with returns and damages. I started my position making $14 which was more then what the truck loaders were making but once minimum wage increased to $14 my pay didn't increase. I was denied a raise and was told that my position was no more important then theirs. 

Current issue: I'm taking a week of vacation, my manager Heather aggressively confronted me saying that it was really inconsiderate of me to take that much time off and that it's unprofessional for my position. I told her that I make just as much a loaders and they wouldn't be questioned for using their vacation week. She said that my position is imortant and not as easily filled while I'm gone. I said that I was told otherwise and that if she felt that way then I should be compensated as such. 

Later in the day she came back and apologized saying that she's five months pregnant and hormones are making her emotional but that I put her in a very bad spot and that I need reconsider taking my vacation. I told her that she's the one that approved my vacation months ago and if her pregnancy is effecting her behavior and decision making then maybe she shouldn't be in her position. 

She left very uspet and told my coworkers that I said she wasn't fit for her job because she's pregnant and that I was acting all high and mighty asking for a raise. I've got a lot people calling me an asshole and a few agreeing me. AITA?

Update: I just got off work and went to Heathers office to apologize but a lead told me she left crying. So Heather told everyone in the office what happened and they took Heather off floor management and scheduling, another manager Alex apologized to me for her behaviour and told me that she was supposed to have someone there for the week I'm off but forgot and tried getting me to rescedual, and that it was inappropriate to do so. Should I still text her and apologize?

Update 2: I texted her apologizing for what I said and she apologized for trying to pressure me to cover her mistake. She said she was switching with Alex to office manager until her maternity leave and she feels less stressed by office then floor which I said was good and I wished her the best.

AITA For calling out a baby crazy woman on the bus?,11602,Not the A-hole,1332,fgo2nz,1583914675.0,"Some context first, I had to get my uterus removed in 2015 because my endometriosis was beginning to grow and attach to my other organs, and had to get my ovaries removed a year later because they started growing massive painful cysts afterwards. I'm dealing with menopause at 28 years old, and still deal with a lot of residual lower abdominal pain. This is just my life now. I admit that the chronic pain definitely puts me on edge quite often and I have a lot less patience than I used to have. 

Now for how I may be the Asshole; 

I had gotten a puppy mid-summer and he was approved to come to work with me after he was 6 months old (got fixed, training, and his vaccines), so he started bussing on my lap with me. Lots of people ask to say hi and stuff, I don't mind. I got him because I decided my life isn't viable for adopting a child (low wages, no time, and I'm single). I had a rough childhood in poverty and refuse to bring another kid into that. Pretty much, the universe is telling me that children just aren't in the cards, and I've accepted this. 

Anyways, yesterday I was on my way home from work with my puppy sleeping on my lap. A woman sat next to me and started gushing over him, and then started talking to me. 

Her: ""Puppies are excellent practice for children!"" 

Me: ""That's nice but I'm not having any.""

Her: ""Oh never say never! I used to say that too until I popped out 3 beautiful sons!""

Me: (starting to get really uncomfortable) ""Cool, good for you. Not going to work for me.""

Her: ""Well you're still young, you better get started now before you miss your window! The clock is ticking!"" 

At this point I was near tears from frustration and said ""Lady I don't HAVE a UTERUS, so I think that window had fucking LONG past. Maybe you should put more thought into what you say to strangers before opening your mouth next time."" 

She looked at me shocked for a moment before she spit out ""Huh, maybe it's a good thing you can't get pregnant. You have the attitude of an abusive parent.""

I had had enough and got off at the next stop even though I was several stops away from home, and cried on a bench for a while. 

When I got home and started venting to a friend, they said that what she said was obviously horrible, but I shouldn't have antagonized her and just moved to a different spot when she wouldn't drop the subject.

AITA not moving out?,11576,Not the A-hole,1693,dh582h,1570965450.0,"So I've (29F) lived in this apartment for the best part of a decade now. I don't own it but I've been saving up because I'm on good terms with my landlord who has agreed to sell it to me for a good price in the next few years since he's starting to get a little bit too old to deal with upkeep.

During this time I've had roommates rotating in and out to help afford rent. The latest roommates are a couple, Dan (24M) and Jess (25F).

A few months ago they announced that Jess was pregnant and due in a couple of months!!! I was really surprised because, I feel mean saying this, she wasn't showing very visibly through her body shape. I congratulated them but when I asked what their plans were for their future family home they said they were hoping that I would move out. I said that goes against my plans that I've had for years and that I was planning on staying here. They insisted that I would ""have"" to move out as they're a new family now and need space. I told them that was great and I respect that need but if they wanted space they would need to find a new place as I was here first.

Shit got pretty cold from there. We haven't really talked much, until now. They had the baby and it's now about a month old. I knew I'd have to bunker down a bit so I took all of my things from the common area (TV, consoles, kitchenware, etc) and with some work I got a pretty nice compact setup in my room with some DIY soundproofing and a makeshift kitchenette so I can ignore the baby's crying. They used my stuff previously and were not happy at all and had to beg on facebook until someone got them new dishes, making sure to shit talk me in all the posts which I thought was pretty rude but whatever.

Because I found out so late about the pregnancy, we're still on the lease for a good 6 months. They want me to break the lease so they can focus on their family. I told them that as I said before this wasn't going to happen. Either they break the lease or they put up with me living my life the way I want to, which includes having people over, listening to music, smoking weed (legal state), drinking, etc. They said they can't afford to break the lease. I said that's unfortunate but neither can I. They said it would be easier for me because I'm not a parent and that I would just need to scrimp a little bit so I can afford to pay two rents. I said maybe but I'm not going to hamstring my lifestyle because they chose to inconvenience everyone around them with their kid. I was admittedly kind of the AH for saying this but I was being harassed.

So my living situation has been kind of a cold war ever since. It's really miserable for everyone right now and while I don't expect them to drop out of the lease I'm kind of hoping they do because them and their banshee kid are really giving me a headache. But I've invested too much into getting this place to leave so even if they stick it out I plan on signing the lease again and maybe seeing if the landlord will be able to not renew them.",False,False,2019-10-13 04:17:30
AITA For bumping up an Ebay auction when a friends automatic bid kept outbidding me?,11584,Not the A-hole,660,g8mic0,1587964097.0,"So, bit of backstory. A friend and I are into scale model building, and a company we both like recently shut down and because the models are so good, people started buying as much as possible. This lead to a high demand on ebay, so that's currently a warzone.

Anywho, I noticed a kit I wanted to buy at an auction.. already at a high price, around 140 bucks, and I decided to bid on it. I kept being outbid by someones max bid which means that regardless of the amount I set someone max bid was automatically putting in a bid that would beat mine for a couple dollars, but instead of creating an automatic bid, I was doing it manually.. I wanted to see how far I'd have to pay to beat this guy. It went all the way up to 200 bucks, and that's when I called it quits. I'd just wait for another one and hope for better luck.

Frustrated, I talked my friend about how crazy the prices were, and how I was bidding on this one item but at 200USD it was crazy. Welp, turns out my friend was bidding on it too, and he was pissed because he now has to pay 200USD for the item, and said I shouldn't be bidding if I had no intent to buy and how I've completely fucked him over now. I told him I did have intent to buy up until 200, but it's not my problem he set a higher bid than what he actually wanted to pay and that's on him.

Later, he sent me another message, saying how he was even more pissed because another seller uploaded the same item at a much lower BUY NOW price, and he couldn't retract his bid anymore. This is where I know I may have been the asshole, but I just said ""Oh cool, thanks for the heads up, buying it now. BTW, goodluck explaining to your wife about spending 200 on a model kit"", and now he is twice pissed at me.

So, reddit... AITA?

AITA for kicking a girl out of our body acceptance support group ?,11578,Not the A-hole,1400,czmw83,1567642060.0,"I'm one of the two people in charge of running a body acceptance support group, we hold meetings for free at a community center after closing hours every saturday. We don't have a sign up process, you can just show up, write down your name and sit down to share. We make it clear that our support group is made strictly for people with body deformities, amputations, severe scarring, disfigurations of some sort... It is not for people who struggle with self esteem and need a boost.

At our first August meeting, a girl showed up whom we'll call Ashley. There wasn't anything visibly ""wrong"" with Ashley, but we didn't give it much thought since in some cases the scarring or whatever else can be hidden underneath clothes. (In my case, a long sleeved shirt hides nearly all of my upper body burn scarring). However, whenever Ashley spoke, she would never mention what she was struggling with just that she was disgusted with her body. The first two sessions, I thought it was fine, to each their pace and I didn't want to force her to share anything she wasn't comfortable with sharing. Even when we would wrap up the meetings and the members would chat to each other, she didn't reveal what exactly it was that made her seek out our support group.

At our third meeting, Ashley showed up wearing a crop top and very short shorts, and again there was nothing visibly ""wrong"". She dodged every question I directed towards her asking about why exactly she was here, asking her if she was a veteran, if she had a surgery... She left quickly when we wrapped up and I couldn't speak with her. Other members asked me what the deal with her was since she went on an other tangent about how disgusting her body was when it was her turn to speak without talking about what her physical defect was exactly or how it was impacting her day to day life.

Last saturday's meeting, I approached Ashley before the meeting to voice my concerns alongside those of the rest of the members. Ashley responded saying we weren't very ""nice"", and that whenever she would speak up negatively about her body and such, we would never counter her with a compliment, we would just stay silent or tell her some ""mumbojumbo"" about how it takes time to come to terms with it. I was getting pretty angry, and I directly asked her why is it that she was here, and I told her if she couldn't give me an answer I'm afraid I would have to kick her out. She didn't answer so I asked her to leave. 

She contacted my co-runner (he organizes and plans timings, deals with the community center...) and he seems to think what I did is not justified, and that I shouldn't turn away anyone or kick them out because of the way they grieve or deal with trauma. When I tried to explain that I doubted she had any physical defects to begin with, he shut it down saying I'm being an asshole for judging someone as not ""disabled enough"".

"AITA for talking to my dad's affair partner, to understand what happened to my family? Nobody else would tell me.",11576,Not the A-hole,804,f6cabw,1582155129.0,"
My last few years have been hellish because my dad got caught having an affair with a college girl. My mom decided to stay with him at the time, they'd fight constantly, but now, years later, they're divorcing. 

I wanted to know and understand more, but my parents wouldn't tell me much. They wanted to keep things between themselves. 

So this year, I reached out to his mistress. I sent her a message on Instagram to say that I know this would sound weird, but I'd like to talk and understand things better.

And to my great surprise, I got an answer. She said she could talk, she feels like she owes it to me. 

I had to bite back some of the uglier things I impulsively wanted to say, because I was trying to understand, not fight... 

I found out the affair started when she was 18 and in college. She signed up for a sugar baby website. She needed money, she had a full ride academic scholarship but money was very tight and her scholarship didn't cover housing over holidays that she needed because her family had kicked her out.

The arrangement with my dad lasted through freshman and sophomore year. She knew he was married but she felt she didn't have options. She was working food service along with classes and was still barely making it. 

She stopped the arrangement when she landed a summer internship that allowed her to save up. But she couldn't get it out of her head.

She'd been feeling a lot of guilt, involving our family and her choices. She's gone to therapy and tried to get her life under control since but she can't shake that feeling.

I came into the conversation expecting to hate her through and through. But I realize, I don't. I don't blame her, she was my damn age at the time and trying to make it work. 

I felt better having talked and I think she did too. I don't think we'll keep talking or anything but I feel like I have a new understanding of things, and that brings me peace.

So everything was great for a while until I had a conversation with my brother and admitted I'd talked to my father's sugar baby. He was like ""what, sugar baby?"" And the truth came out. He got angry enough that my dad was spending our families money in that way, that he confronted my dad.

Then my dad confronted me. He was really mad that I'd gone behind his back and met with the girl, he said that this stuff was something he and my mother wanted to keep between the adults only.

I snapped at him and said that if he wanted it to be ""adult business"" he shouldn't have gotten involved with someone young enough to be my classmate. 

He was even madder to hear that...

A lot of people in the comments are worried I hurt my mom more by going about things this way.

I didn't mention this earlier because the post was already so long, but I'd talked with my mom a lot prior to this, and she always said she wanted to be open and wanted me to know when I was older / when the divorce proceedings had gone through. 

But she said that it would badly impact her in divorce proceedings if she could be accused of poisoning the children against the other parent. So she said that she didn't want to have this conversation just now, when we were still young and when the divorce is in progress. She wanted it to wait until all of us (me, my big brother, and my little sister) were older.

After the events in this post, I talked to my mom again and told her everything. And she just seemed relieved and happy and said ""OK, so now you know."" And laughed about how we'd be saved an awkward conversation later on.

My dad comes from old family money, but my mom's family was very middle-class. But when my sister (24) and I were growing up, my mom acted like she had always been upper class, and is very snobbish. I remember how we would go to dinner with her siblings and she would insist on choosing the restaurant to make sure it was ""up to her standards"" make a big show of paying the bill, and then would shit-talk her siblings and their spouses/kids the whole way home, making fun of their clothes, cars, jobs, you name it. She has always placed importance on whoever was wealthiest/had the ""best"" family, and wouldn't let my sister and I hang out with kids after school who weren't up to her ""standards."" It's made our relationship a little strained, especially since she obsesses about these things today, but she's my mom and I love her.

Anyways, due to covid I'm staying with my parents since my college sent everybody home. My sister is living in another state, but we have family Zoom calls once a week. On one of the early Zoom calls, my sister told us that she had a new boyfriend and they ended up moving in together for quarantine (my sister has her own apartment which my parents pay for partially). They go to the same law school, and he seemed very sweet when we talked to him. My mom started in with the ""parents/childhood/plans"" line of questioning. He told her that he had gotten a scholarship for law school since his dad was a construction worker and his mom was a preschool teacher, and that he grew up in a small town. My mom was super chilly to him after this, and afterwards went on a rant about how he ""wasn't good enough for \[sister\]"" and how ""he just wants her money after all."" My dad and I thought she'd stop, but she did this every. single. call. Super cold to a perfectly nice guy, and ranting and talking trash about him afterwards. She did the whole thing again after our most recent call, and I was pretty fed up. I asked her to stop saying that stuff and she said it was the truth, that he was just a gold digger. I asked her how she was different from him since she grew up a lot like him and asked if she just wanted dad's money after all.

She got super upset with me and didn't tell me to get out or anything but she's been sort of ignoring me since then and makes passive aggressive comments or mentioning how she's been crying. My dad talked to me after dinner and said that I really hurt her feelings and she just wants to make sure my sister ends up with a good guy even if she doesn't seem like it. He said that she was just trying to be a good mom and I upset her. I feel really bad- she can be annoying at times but she is my mom and I don't want to hurt her. AITA?

Between my vasectomy and her being on birth control (for non-pregnancy related reasons) the odds of her getting pregnant should be astronomically low.  We couldn’t believe she was pregnant, and my gf assured me she didn’t cheat and was willing to take a dna test to prove it (if that’s possible at this stage) and I believe her.  I also went back to the doctor to get a sperm count, and somehow a small amount of sperm were present and there would be a small chance I could get someone pregnant.  

Now I don’t want the kid, and was under the assumption she didn’t either.  She says she assumed she would get an abortion if she was pregnant, but actually being pregnant is different and she’s having second thoughts.  While I strongly want her to get an abortion, I realize that it’s ultimately her choice, but I told her that if she does go through with the pregnancy (and doesn’t adopt it), I want nothing to do with it.  I’d do whatever I legally have to do in terms of child support, but I won’t be involved with raising the kid.  Also our relationship would effectively be over because I don’t want to be with someone who has a kid.  My friends and brother think I’m a complete asshole and that I should suck it up if she chooses to have the kid.  I think I took reasonable, if not extreme precautions to ensure I never had to worry about a kid and that I shouldn’t have to raise a kid I don’t want as long as I fulfill my legal obligations.  So reddit, AITA for not wanting to raise my kid?

Edit: to all the people saying the kid isn’t mine, she offered (unprompted) to take a dna test.  Along with my sperm test results and having no reason to suspect she’d cheat, I fully expect that the child would be mine.

Edit 2: thank you to everyone who has responded.  After further discussion with my gf, she is set on having the baby and is slightly against adoption, but considering it.  She still wants me to be in her life, even if our relationship is over and it’s just as friends.  If she has the baby, I’d treat it the same as I do my friends kids; I’d be friendly towards them but have no interest in raising them, just with the addition of child support. We are planning to get a dna test done as well.",False,1576862169.0,2019-12-19 23:19:30
AITA for making my son make dinner after he insulted his sister's cooking?,11609,Not the A-hole,998,hhrd2b,1593425518.0,"This is my first Reddit post so sorry if some things are wonky.

Since the quarantine started, my daughter (15) has taken up cooking and baking. Our oven sucked so we got her a new one as an early birthday present (and that we just needed one). She's been baking nonstop and recently started making us dinner because my son and I are working hard to re-do our backyard (think building a shed and hardcore gardening).

Since she's inexperienced, my daughter started out with a really easy recipe that involved frozen vegetables. The dish was great, the carrots were a little underdone but I thought that just gave it a little extra crunch and didn't say anything. My son, however, has always made fun of his younger sister and comments on everything he sees her doing in the kitchen. While eating dinner, he said something along the lines of ""some poor excuse for cooked vegetables"" which made my daughter upset. She takes criticism to heart and this comment kinda crushed her pride. I told my son that his comment was unacceptable and that he should be grateful that he had a fresh meal ready for him when we decided to take a break from the yard work. I also told him that he should make dinner tomorrow since he thinks it's so easy.

Now, some things about my son, he is very good hands-on kinda work which is why I have him out with me doing the hard labor in the yard. He hates cooking and since my husband is a very good cook, he expects his dad to do the cooking for him. (I sometimes worry for when he goes of to college and doesn't know how to make anything for himself) When I told him that he had to make dinner tomorrow, he complained and said he didn't know what to make. I didn't back down and told him to think of something.

After dinner, he approached me and asked if I actually expected him to make dinner. I said yes. It's only one meal, I'm sure he can come up with something. He complained again and said he was sorry for the comment he made. My husband thinks I should just let it go but I think this would be a good learning experience for him. I'm sure my daughter would appreciate her work being taken more seriously too.

So AITA?

Edit: I want to mention a few things.

This is not a gender thing at all. My daughter bakes and cooks because she wants to, we have never pushed it onto her as something she should be doing because of her gender. She picked it up herself last year.

I do believe that my son should know how to cook before he goes off into the 'real world' it's just been hard when he actively rebels against anything cooking wise. I will not back down from this. Thank you for your support.

Edit 2: The oven being a birthday present was my daughter's idea. I didn't word it correctly in the original post, that is my mistake. Our old oven was on it's last legs and she was the one who begged my husband to buy a new one. My husband had been holding off on it because of money and because no one used it enough to warrant a new one until quarantine started. Since she is the one to use it the most and she is the one who went out with her dad to pick it out and make sure it was perfect for her as well as my husband, she dubbed it her birthday present. It will not be the only thing she receives for her birthday and we had already picked out all of her presents before the oven. ",False,1593404841.0,2020-06-29 03:11:58

AITA for absolutely despising my physically disabled brother?,11552,Asshole,2007,gz51bm,1591670197.0,"When I was 13, my parents had my younger brother. They only intended on having one child, me, but he was a “happy surprise”. The main reason they only wanted one child is because my mom is a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy carrier and didn’t want to risk having a boy and him having it. My brother was born and my mom started noticing signs when he was about 2, when he went on to be diagnosed with DMD. I’m now 20, and my brother is 7. 

My parents have always massively babied him, he has little to no discipline and does whatever he wants, and gets away with it because my parents don’t want to spend the entire time they have with him telling he can’t do things he wants to. I’ve never connected with him at all, it’s an awkward age gap and we have absolutely nothing in common. As well as that, I went from being an only child for 13 years to having a brother that required a lot of extra attention and I resented him for it during my teenage years. 

Over the past year or so, he has deteriorated greatly and a lot quicker than he was expected to. He can’t walk and requires a wheelchair, which meant giving up my bedroom downstairs after 20 years of it being mine. In all honesty I find it quite embarrassing having so much equipment for him in the house so I rarely bring friends round. He’s already started showing signs of heart deterioration which means my parents are constantly worried and rarely have time for me. With the rate at which he’s deteriorating, he’s not expected to live past his teenage years.

A few nights ago I was doing some work for college. I’m a key worker so I had just got home from a 8 hour shift and was absolutely exhausted. I went downstairs with my laptop and my mom and brother were in the kitchen watching something. My mom asked me to watch him so she could go to the bathroom and I, as a joke, said “it’s not like he can go anywhere, he’s not strong enough to move his own wheelchair” and she told me off and left. 

I was trying to do work when my brother just kept asking me to do stuff with him. As I said, we don’t have a relationship and I was trying to do work so I just ignored him. He kept pestering me and eventually said “why do you never spend time with me” and I responded by telling him it was because I didn’t like him. My mom walked back in at that exact moment and grabbed my arm and pulled me upstairs before saying if I ever spoke to my brother like that again she’d kick me out. I told her it’s not like she’d notice anyway because she never talks to me. We haven’t spoken since and apparently my brother is upset. AITA?

UPDATE - Hi everyone. I’ve read pretty much all your comments now, and all of the pleasant messages I’ve got. I have come to the conclusion that I have been pushing my brother away because I’m scared to watch him deteriorate and eventually die, but I’m not going to do that anymore. He has limited time here and I’m going to make my relationship with him the best it can be before he goes. I apologised to my parents and told them how I felt and they apologised. I apologised to my brother and he asked me to play with him so I did, we had fun. Thankyou for your advice, I really appreciate it",True,1591720363.0,2020-06-08 19:36:37
"AITA for getting quite drunk with my friend at a MLM ""party""?",11524,Not the A-hole,1331,f5cykx,1581992257.0,"
My friend Jess got a party invite on a Saturday night from Sarah, who she knew in her old dorm.

Jess said it was some sort of spa theme, but we were both like ""lol but cut the crap, it's an open invite house party in (trashy area in college town) we all know it's just gonna be an excuse to get drunk. 

So I bought a bottle of whiskey to share. She and I pregamed the party at my place too.

We rolled in a little late, and it was a weird vibe. The girl hosting, Sarah, seemed irritated we were late, which was weird. We went in and everyone was just chilling in the living room with champagne. 

Sarah was giving out lotion samples like a sales pitch. I mainly just talked to Jess through this about some drama going on in our friend group because I didn't know anyone else there. I'd also opened our whiskey and had poured Jess and I glasses after we drank the champagne. Then Sarah sat down and tried getting the group's attention and got annoyed at us for not paying attention.

She was making this pitch to sell things, handing out order forms. But also to recruit other people to sell too. I was kinda giggling to Jess, what the fuck did you bring us to? And what kinda business is that; it makes like no business sense to get more competitors!

Jess was like ""shit I don't know, do you wanna see if we can find another party? So we both went on our phones and started hitting people up, unsuccessfully. We were also still sipping whiskey and were getting steadily more drunk especially compared to everyone else.

We started talking to a couple other girls there, a lesbian couple, and I was like ""what the hell is this party?"" And they basically said that they didn't expect this coming in but it seemed like some kinda pyramid scheme. And wow could they use a better drink than cheap champagne. 

At that point Jess pulled out our big bottle of whiskey and the four of us started sharing it. They took some shots at first then were just sipping. It was genuinely fun, they were really cool people and were telling us a crazy hilarious story that had us laughing like mad.

Then, Sarah came up to our group and were like ""can you all leave? You've been rude through every part of this"" and Jess went ""look, you invited us for a party! If you want this to be a business thing be upfront about it or else people are gonna show up and party. 

Sarah told Jess to grow up. She wanted us to go. I asked if we could wait till Uber surge pricing went down and she said no, to get out if we were gonna be disrespectful. The couple we were hanging out with actually left with us to hang out.

Jess and the girls we'd made friends with got these angry texts that night saying that we were super disrespectful and unsupportive, and trashy if we couldn't even go one hour to support a friend's business without getting sloppy drunk.

AITA for refusing to help my GF look for her nose piercing after she lost it for a *sixth* time?,11530,Not the A-hole,1612,fs7jhf,1585663248.0,"Recently I took her to go get her nose pierced cos it was her birthday & she’s always wanted to do it. It cost me around $90 which deffo isn’t chump change cos I’m a semi-broke university student.

So we were over at her parent’s and she accidentally flushed it down the kitchen sink. Don’t ask me how, I wasn’t next to her. Her father took apart the piping underneath and managed to shake it out which was really good. She & I were both relieved. But over the past week she’s lost it *three more times*. Every time it went down our bathroom sink & I’d have to take a not insignificant amount of time to take apart the plumbing (which is nasty in its own right) and get it out. I asked her how in Jesus’ name she keeps losing it and she says that when she does a toner scrub (pours toner on a cotton pad & scrubs her face) she accidentally rips it out. Now look. I used to have a stud so I know how easy it can be to lose it but I always made sure to watch it when I was washing my face. All it takes is a bit of effort really.

So this morning she wakes me up and tells me that she’s flushed it down the god damn sink AGAIN. Obviously I’m really annoyed at this point. As I’m taking apart the plumbing once again, I tell her that this is the last time I’m doing this and that she better watch me so she knows how to do it in case she loses it again. She says fine, okay, whatever. I find it and it’s all good. 

Guess what happened an hour ago? Yep, she flushed it down the sink. For. The. Sixth. Time. And I say, look. I told you I’m not going to do it again. I didn’t say I told you so, or you’re being dumb, or anything like that. I said that that sucks but I am not going to take it apart again. Like, she’s got hands too. She’s seen me do it so many times by now she should know how to do it.

She got frustrated with me and said I’ve done it so many times so why not do it again. That made me laugh because if she really wanted me to do it then that would’ve been the worst possible thing to say. She asked me to call a plumber I said no I can’t afford that. She then threatened to call her dad to do it and I laughed again, like am I supposed to be scared of that? lol

AITA for throwing a woman out of my store for how she spoke to her own son?,11509,Not the A-hole,465,fr0n3k,1585488636.0,"There is a young man who comes into my store every now and then.

I take offence at such abusive language being used and ask her to desist. She then says “who the fuck are you to tell me how to speak to my son?”. She then continued to be abusive. 

I explain this is my store and I will have security remove her if she doesn’t leave. I said that the young man is welcome to stay. She leaves and a few minutes later the young man follows her home.

My parents are devout Christians and love our children just as much as we do. I can count on one hand the people I trust with my kids and they're on the list. 

However, they simply don't respect the boundaries my wife and I have set, assumedly because they believe they're saving my children from the eternal damnation they couldn't save me from. I feel their hearts are in the right place,  but the last time they visited for summer (we live in a different state from my parents) they came back speaking like we'd been raising them as Christians from birth. ""God says this and that"", etc.  

The most recent conversation went like this: 

""Why don't you believe in God, daddy?""

""Because he's not real sweetie.""

""But Grandma and Grandpa say he is!""


After this one I told my parents that if they keep doing this they won't get to see the kids without my or my wife's supervison. 

They told me I was being hateful and it was ""wrong to keep a grandchild from her grandparents just because you don't want them to hear about the Lord"".

AITA: For telling my teacher the reason I failed was because the student was too obese.,11486,Not the A-hole,2752,ewn7r0,1580499494.0,"So I’m a nursing student and we’re doing pulses and blood pressures in a test off setting. We are matched with other students to do our pulse and blood pressure we only have one try and if we fail we get kicked out of the program. So I get matched with this girl I’ll call Patty. Patty is at least 350 pounds and her arms are as wide as watermelons. 

So I had to do her pulse well if you don’t know anything about doing pulse on an extremely obese patient it’s hard to find because there are so many layers of fat. So the teacher and I were trying to find her pulse and we both were struggling. We finally got it and the teacher lost it half way through so I had to start over. I mean this is a teacher with many years of nursing experience who couldn’t find this girls pulse because she was over 350 pounds. 

So I’m on a time limit right. So her arm is too big for the regular blood pressure cuff. So I had to find the thigh cuff that people use on thighs on her arm. Well when you pump them up it’s really hard because of all the resistance so I could hardly pump it up too which gave me a wacky blood pressure reading. 

I told the teacher it was unfair that I was partnered with Patty because she was so obese and that I was given an impossible task. I told her that I shouldn’t be out of the program when other people had partners who were a normal weight that they could actually palpitate their pulses. My teacher said that was rude but I think it’s true so AITA?

I just wanted to add that my teacher because she was having problems finding it too gave me a redo and I passed. 

I didn’t say it anywhere near Patty I said it in private with the door closed and I did talk to her after and she didn’t know a thing. I told her I failed but it was going to be ok. We hugged it out. 

I do feel truly bad for feeling hostile toward her since it was my fault that I failed the first time, no one else. But when I wrote this I was in a bad place emotionally and felt a lot of anger toward everyone. I wasn’t even angry at Patty I was most angry at the situation I was put into and I didn’t think I was going to be able to remediate. So I had no anger toward Patty.

AITA for telling my 7 year old the truth about his mother?,11491,Not the A-hole,969,ekicbi,1578283932.0,"When I was younger I had a casual sexual relationship with a woman (Sally) I met at a restaurant. We had sex more than 5 times but less than 10 times. I texted Sally on a Friday night, which is when we normally hooked up, asking if she wanted to meet up and she told me to lose her number. I did and later found out she was pregnant. I contacted her again to see if the child was mine. She told me it wasn't and that she would be getting an abortion anyway and once again told me I needed to lose her number. 

I moved on. One day I got a message from Sally's mother. She accused me of abandoning her daughter and my son. I told her I had no clue what she was talking about. She informed me that she had been taking care of Sally's son since he was 4 months old because Sally had a drug issue. At this point he was 1.5 years old and she (grandma) was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She said she couldn't do it alone anymore. I ended up getting a DNA test and found out I was the dad. His grandmother passed away shortly after I took custody. 

He's 7 now (8 in August) and has been asking about his mom a lot lately. I have always told him that his mom loved him but wasn't able to take care of him. He has accepted that answer until recently and wanted more answers. I decided to be honest. He asked why he had to live with his grandmother before living with me. I told him, ""Your mom and I weren't talking when she was pregnant with you. I didn't know she had you until your grandmother told me. After that I did everything I could to get you."" He asked if he would ever be able to see his mom again. I said, ""I don't know. I don't even know where she is. She has a sickness called addiction. Sometimes when people are sick like that they make decisions that no one understands. That doesn't mean she doesn't love you though."" He cried a little and said he hopes his mom gets better. I was gutted and called my mom. She said I shared way too much and hurt him. She said I should have shared much less and stuck with the ""she couldn't take care of you"" line even though he was asking for more.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented, even those who said I was an asshole for the explanation. All perspectives were read and considered. I couldn't and can't respond to every post but trust that I have read them. 

This happened yesterday and he seemed okay today. He didn't say anything about his mother and I am not going to push it. I have always let him lead these conversations. I think I am going to look into therapy and/or support groups for children of parents battling addiction. I will also be looking into resources for myself to help me navigate all of these new situations as they arise. I have no experience with kids other than my own so I may be overestimating my son's ability to understand things and maybe someone can help me work on that. I'm honestly not even sure if his mom is alive. Last I heard she was but that was a while ago. We have a lot to navigate and I could use some help from a professional so I will be looking into that.

AITA for not letting my friend stay at my husband's cabin after I heard her true opinion of my husband,11487,Not the A-hole,793,gcpfkk,1588535988.0,"My husband has a cabin he inherited in west virginia, with hundreds of acres of beautiful(and some not beautiful) land. He and his family would usually go there during the summer. My husband and I are both blessed with large amounts of vacation time so we also usually go during the summer. He's a big outdoors type, loves being outside in any capacity, loves fishing, etc. He's also really generous, especially when it comes to the outdoors. He loves helping his friends with their gardens, and he even taught one of his friend's son to fish.

So one of my close friends asked me if she could use the cabin for a little getaway for her and her husband during the lockdown. They're both furloughed and bored at home with nothing to do. My husband and I are both still working, so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal, and he might say yes. I asked him, and made sure that there wasn't any pressure on him to say yes(I wouldn't want him to feel like he was loaning out his family's cabin because I told him to), but he said that it would be fine.

Well apparently my friend isn't a big fan of my husband's, despite him letting her use the cabin. Because today I got a call from another friend, who told me that my friend was trash talking my husband behind our backs. She said that he's annoying, and that he didn't deserve his job(she applied for a job that my husband ended up getting, mere coincidence, but apparently she's still bitter about it), and that all he's good for is his cabin. My friend that told me said she felt like she was obligated   
 to since we were letting her use the cabin, but that she's said this stuff before. Now it was pretty surprising to me that she said all of these things, because she's never seemed to be that kind of person, and I've known her for a long time. So I called her and asked her about it, and she owned up to it, and then started saying how I wasn't ever supposed to hear.

Well then I got pretty pissed off, and told her that she couldn't use the cabin, and that if she had anything to say about my husband she could say it to his face. She then got mad at me and said its not fair to punish her for something that she thought she was saying in confidentiality. I don't know why she thought she would be saying it in confidentiality.

My other friend called me and said that she wasn't supposed to tell me what my friend said, and that she's just bitter about not getting the job, and didn't really mean it, and that I shouldn't punish her for it. My friend a little later then called me and apologized for what she said, but it still feels wrong letting her use something of my husband's after she said those things. Also, being bitter about a job she didn't get 2 years ago isn't a reason to go trash talking people behind their backs.

This weekend my wife asked her to empty the dishwasher, and take the trash out. She said ""Ok"" then just went up to her room. I went up to her room an hour later, and found her laying in bed watching youtube on her phone (Volleyball videos, nothing important, if anything on youtube could be considered important) I took her phone away, and said ""Your mom asked you to do your chores, not watch videos, please do them so i can do mine"" She said ""Whatever"" and just continued laying there.

I know how important social media is to the kids now a days, so i figured I would try that, and see if anything happened.

I gave her 20 minutes, and still nothing.

She says it was so embarrassing, and I'm an a-hole for doing that.

But come last night, my wife asked her to do the dishes. She first refused and went up to her room, but I reminded her what would happen if she didn't listen.

AITA for not watching my brother is law’s daughter?,11467,Not the A-hole,875,ep4bpf,1579133880.0,"My sister in law and I are both about 8 months pregnant, being just a few weeks apart. I’ve had a complicated pregnancy so I went on an extended leave from work, leaving me at home much of the day. I watch my brother and sister in law’s daughter frequently and free of charge, usually at a last moments notice. 

Their daughter (9) is a very sweet and intelligent girl. She’s very curious and inquisitive to the point of even being nosy and sometimes snarky/judgmental. She will interrupt a conversation between adults to ask a question about the conversation or input her opinion. This can sometimes be frustrating but she’s never reprimanded for it and always obliged. I still had my Christmas tree up on the 3rd of this month and she walked into house without greeting saying “you’re lazy Auntie, why is your tree up?!”. She’s over heard me paying a bill on the phone and as soon as I hung up she asked “who was that on the phone? why did you pay your bill late?”.  I grew up kind of old fashioned, I would have been told it was rude to ask those kind of questions and better to stay in a child’s place. My beliefs aside, I always patiently answer her questions and let her wedge herself into my personal business. Yesterday, I caught her watching youtube on her phone, which is strictly a NO NO mandated by her parents, when I asked her why she would do that she said “well, they watch youtube so I should be able to watch it.” I explained that they were adults and she was a child, therefore they don’t have to abide by the same rules. She doesn’t seem to understand that she is a child and not equal to an adult.

On to the issue today. At around 8am, her mother texted me asking to watch their daughter at noon because they have a prenatal appointment for an ultrasound and don’t want to leave her sitting in the waiting room for 2 hours. I expressed that I have an appointment with my attorney at 1pm. Her mom said “oh it’s fine, you can just let her wait in the waiting room”. I suggested that they allow their daughter to go to the appointment with them and instead of her waiting in the waiting room, she be able to see the ultrasound and hear the baby, ect. My sister in law said she doesn’t want their daughter in the ultrasound room because she will interrupt and just be her normal, snarky self. My appointment is only about an hour or so but I feel like if her parents don’t want to be subjected to her behavior they need to adjust it and not pawn her off on me.

Am I the asshole for refusing to take her to my appointment?

Edit: I see a lot of people saying I and the family are wrong for discounting her inquisitive nature. This is not the case at all. Everyone always answers her questions in depth, no matter how private or personal they are. When she asked why I paid the bill late, I explained about about my leave from work and having to budget differently. Also, her parents have explained that youtube is not always a safe place for children and will be restricted until a certain age. The child believes that if it’s safe enough of her parents, it’s safe enough for her. She doesn’t agree with being protected from youtube. 

Also, she had a half day at school today which is why the babysitting issue came up.",False,1579135958.0,2020-01-15 16:18:00
AITA for telling my SIL her son can’t come to my bachelorette weekend?,11467,Not the A-hole,1002,fauoqd,1582925226.0,"Hi! I’m on a throwaway just in case, can never be too careful!

Me (25f) and my fiancé (28m) have been together 6 years and have a little boy who is 2. I am an only child and my fiancé has 4 sisters. For context, I’ve never had a strong relationship with any of them (not through lack of trying) They are extremely close and even bought houses next to one another. They kind of have a clique and I’m tolerated I guess, but not really accepted. They have often vocalised indirectly how they prefer fiancés ex (who cheated on him) which hurts. I’ve just kind of accepted how life is and try my best to build bridges where I can. 

The problem starts here: for my bachelorette party, we decided to book a weekend away to a hotel in a nearby country. I was super excited as I have never had a ‘girls trip’. It works out to around $200 each for 3 nights including flights. We booked it a year and a half in advance to give everyone a chance to save. So far there have been no problems with anyone, except for SILs. 

They made comments on the hotel, location, etc despite them being best in the area. Myself and my OH are workingclass and have to save for the wedding. This is our only luxury. His sisters on the other hand are all well-off (married into money) and have multiple trips a year both with and without their kids.

We agreed and the place was booked. Now, 2 months before the trip, one SIL is insisting on bringing her child (the same age as our son) I refused and have been called a huge asshole for it by all of his sisters. They say she has anxiety over leaving him with her husband who has had him while she has had week long trips before with her friends no problem. She has never been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I have had anxiety for years and have recently stopped counselling so I understand what it can be like, but I suspect it’s an excuse. She is very self centred and always seeks the limelight (announcing her pregnancy at her friends baby shower etc) and I’ve reached the end of my tether.

Our hotel is adults only. We have excursions booked where children aren’t permitted, have bar crawls planned etc and an adults only spa day. There is absolutely no place for a child, let alone for a 2 year old boy. She expects us to change the hotel last minute to accommodate him. 

He is my nephew and I love him, but this is my ONE thing that I want to be about me. I’ve never had a birthday party, engagement party, baby shower etc. I just want this one trip to be about me, as selfish as I sound. Im getting rude texts and phone calls from everyone telling me it’s wrong to exclude him (even my own son isn’t coming- my fiancé has even offered nephew and BIL to stay at our place with them for the weekend too, which she has refused.) 

AITA for not wanting him there? I am on the verge of just cancelling the whole thing and all I have done the last few days is cry, it’s getting to the point I don’t want to go at all because I’m scared they’re going to make it hell for me either way.

EDIT: I just want to say thank you to everyone for your verdicts, whether I’m NTA or not. I never thought this would get even half as much attention as it has. I’m going to put my foot down and bluntly tell them no children, and as others have suggested, say how she will be sorely missed but everything is non refundable and can’t be changed such short notice. If they all drop out then so be it. If I’m an asshole, so be it. I’m only planning on having a bachelorette once in my life and goddamn it I’m going to enjoy it without any regrets. Thanks for giving my head a wobble guys. Sometimes it’s easy to lose sight of yourself when you’re swimming in negativity! Love to you all, even that one guy that called me an asshole.

I truly listened to what everyone said on my last post and I ultimately decided to tell Sam about the video. 

I said him down and followed what some people said and told him, “I love you and I’m so proud of how far you’ve come but I feel like you need to know this. There’s a video out there of you getting high. I didn’t want you to be blindsided by it. I’ll show it to you if you want.”

He thought about it but told me he didn’t want to see it as he thought it would be a trigger for him. 

I told him I understood and that I was there for him. 

As far as I know, he hasn’t watched it. Honestly, I hope he doesn’t but I just felt like he deserved to know.

AITA for not letting my roommate's girlfriend bring her emotional support dogs over because I'm allergic?,11430,Not the A-hole,949,fi3pp2,1584150774.0,"My (f28) roommate (f28) of 4 years has been dating a girl (f25) for a few months now. They've asked me many times if her girlfriend can bring her emotional support dogs over (edit: one is an emotional support dog and the other is a licensed therapy dog, neither are service animals) because they're essential to her girlfriend's mental health. I said I understand they're important to her girlfriend, but that I'm not comfortable having dogs in the house, due to both allergic reactions and anxiety that I feel regarding pets in the house (I didn't grow up around animals). I have said I'm not okay with dogs from day 1 of living together. 

Every spring, I cough nonstop from February to May from allergies. It's been getting worse and worse this season, and so a month ago, I went to the doctor and found out I actually have allergy-induced asthma. My doctor gave me two different inhalers and a bunch of other medication, and told me to be careful around pets during this season and especially what is tracked onto my carpet because I was wheezing so much. Literally cough attacks throughout the day everyday, trouble breathing, missing work, trying to stay indoors as much as possible to avoid allergens.

I told my roommate about this and the dog topic didn't come up again. Then I found yesterday that they brought the dogs over anyway when I wasn't home because my roommate was sick and her girlfriend brought her food and medicine. My roommate said the dogs would be in her room the whole time. I said I was unhappy because fur/dander does get everywhere through clothes/feet, and asked that she at least vacuum after the dogs leave. After getting home, I went to get something from my car, but I guess they thought I left for the evening, because when I came back a few minutes later, the dogs were roaming freely through the house.

I opened my front door to find them in the kitchen, and they barked when I came in and freaked me out since it wasn't something I was expecting in my house (I'll admit I am a little afraid of dogs - I blame it on my immigrant upbringing lol).

I said I thought it was inconsiderate that something was brought into my home that makes me uncomfortable and feel unwell. My roommate got mad at me for making this a ""huge deal"" when they were only in there ""for a good 10 seconds"" (edit: in the kitchen for 10 seconds before retreating to the bedroom) and making her girlfriend feel bad (I don't know why her gf would bring them in the first place then when she already knows how I feel). Girlfriend and dogs left immediately after.

My roommate previously said it's hard to be at her girlfriend's house instead because her girlfriend has horses and my roommate is allergic to them (edit: she said she might be allergic to the hay or other things around the house due to the horses, and the dogs in our house shouldn't be a problem since they'll stay in her room the whole time). Ironic?

Also I'm moving out-of-state in 3 weeks, so I was thinking they would just wait it out...instead of creating conflict last minute after so many harmonious years. This also makes me wonder if they've been sneaking the dogs in for a while without my knowledge, and if that's why my allergies have been worse this year than any other year. Home should be a sanctuary! 

Tldr: am I the asshole for not wanting my roommate's girlfriend to bring dogs over against my wishes because of the medical and psychological impacts on me and my level of comfort in my own home where I pay to live?",False,1584513522.0,2020-03-13 18:52:54

I was away from home for about a week due to work. I gave her a simple rule of forbidding her bringing anyone over. Not her new boyfriend or her friends. No exceptions to this rule.

During my week away. One of her Instagram posts showed her BF wearing one of my jackets on a night out. I called her out on it and she apologised and told me she put everything back. So now I know that he has been in my room and going through my things. 

What killed me inside was that she also had a party. Lots of drinking involved. Including my vintage whisky. They cost me around £7000 and were near full. So I demanded that they pay me back. 

My sister is begging me that she didn't know and thought her boyfriend bought them. Her boyfriend blocked me and called me crazy. He is now thinking about breaking up with her over this.

AITA for making my parents pay me to homeschool/tutor my nieces and nephews since they keep enabling my narc sister?,11419,Not the A-hole,344,gg3mdq,1589007248.0,"So my older sister is a narcissist. Plain and simple. We were never close since we had a pretty big age gap (she’s 36 I’m 19) but she was always evil. I remember she used to pinch me as a child and said I ruined her life because my parents had to pay attention to their only other child. She was 17 when I was born but at the time had already dropped out of high school and was in rehab. I never really saw her until I was around 5-6, and that’s when I started hating her. 

She started having kids when I got to middle school. She has five. They were all born addicted to drugs. My parents adopted them and we have been basically raising them as she goes in and out of prison. My parents have always enabled her behavior, letting her take the kids to their dads house (who never saw them any other time their mom wasn’t in jail) for days on end. This causes me major anxiety since they’re so young and I don’t trust her or her baby dad. 


My parents also give her money all the time which she spends on drugs. She never comes and sees her kids unless she says she’s taking them out to dinner and a movie even though my nieces and nephews tell me they just get left in a house basement while their parents are upstairs doing god knows what. People come in and out of that house since her baby dad sells drugs and I’m worried for my nieces and nephews safety. Despite being born high they are all perfectly healthy.


I always tells my parents to stop enabling my sister and not let her take her kids unless she gets clean. My parents just always give in since she guilts them into saying they’re the reason she’s addicted to drugs. My parents beg to pay for her rehab but she refuses. She hasn’t gone since I was in middle school.


I’m busy with my own homework. Now with schools switching to online my parents expect me to help my siblings with their homework and Zoom and stuff. I already don’t work since I babysit the kids 24/7. Now I’m expected to be their teacher basically for free? Instead of giving my sister 500$ a month (she’s been released from jail due to corona and back at her baby dads house) they should give it to me. They are hesitant but I’m putting my foot down.

So, I (M19), have a best friend (M19) called “Avery”. He’s been my friend since kindergarten, and we’re tight as hell. He came out as gay when he was 15, and I’m super proud of him and how far he’s come. Okay.

So we recently met a girl called “Sally”. Sally is F20, and she says she’s super supportive of the LGBT+ community and shit like that. She’s closer to Avery than she is to me, but we’re all kinda close, but Avery and I are still closer to each other. 

Avery has a boyfriend - “Jackson” and they go out and do stuff and like couple stuff and whatever. Jackson is bisexual, and here’s where it gets weird. Last night, while we were all drunk, Sally confided in me that she thinks it’s cool she finally has a a “gay bestie” and that it’s super sexy when Avery and Jackson make out, and she’s touched herself thinking of that. She also told me that since Jackson is bi, she wants to have a threesome with him and Avery, and maybe make Avery realise “girls aren’t all that bad.”

Imo that’s pretty fucked up. I haven’t talked to Sally since then, and I honestly don’t know if I want to be her friend if this is how she views my friend.

AITA for feeling this way? WIBTA if I tell Avery about this? I feel I’d want to know if I was my friend’s walking porno.

EDIT II: Okay, so I messaged her an hour ago, and her sentiment hasn’t changed, but she did try and laugh it off. She pressed on the “maybe Avery’s secretly bi” for a hot minute, and that if the roles were reversed, I’d probably jerk off to it.",True,1581525056.0,2020-02-12 10:12:32

I know who it is because she facebooks under her real name like an idiot so I found her phone number in the book and called her and told her to take the photo down and she tried to tell me that there's nothing wrong with drinking creamer or being homeless and I told her I'm not homeless and that she obviously thinks there's a problem with those things or else why would she take the photo and unless she took it down I'd start following her around and taking photos of everything she does.

WIBTA if I didn’t let my niece with autism use my weighted blanket anymore?,11366,Not the A-hole,652,ddprev,1570323052.0,"
A couple weeks ago though I saved up for a weighted blanket because I thought it would be a lot easier to deal with and it totally was. Now I just use that blanket along with my regular comforter and sheet set. Now while I absolutely love it, I don’t need it to sleep.

Last week I (17) got roped into watching my niece (5) over night because my sister had to work and our mom had plans. My niece has autism which causes her to have tantrums every now and then which is why I don’t often watch her, but sometimes I have to because my sister (23) can’t always afford or find a sitter, which is why she still lives with our mom. In case its not clear we’re actually half sisters and half the time I them the other half I live with my dad and step mom.

So my niece had a really hard time going to sleep. Like it was almost midnight and she was all over the place. Which is not uncommon, but I was really tired myself and just wanted to go to sleep. So I thought why not try and use the blanket on her because thats kind of what they’re made for. Well it worked pretty well and calmed her down and she soon fell asleep. I was a little annoyed though that I didn’t have my blanket to use anymore. 

The next morning my sister found her with the blanket and we got to talking about them. I told her how well it worked. She didn’t really believe me so I let her use another night. My sister was very pleased by the results. So, over throughout the week when my niece had two really bad tantrums my sister asked if she could use the blanket. I said yes because she just looked so exhausted herself.

When she looked into buying one she became reluctant because my niece only likes very specific things my sister doesn’t want to get her another one that she may not like since I don’t remember which brand I got. She is short on cash so she doesn’t want to have to buy multiples because honestly they can get rather expensive. I know mine was over $100 because I wanted to make sure I didn’t have to deal with the beads spilling out issues that a lot of the cheaper ones have. I

Well, when I went back to my dads the other night I brought my blanket with me. My sister calls me late one night completely frazzled and asks where I left my blanket because niece just wont calm down. When I told her I had it with me at my dads she was upset. Not at me, just at the situation she had to deal with.

Now I’m supposed to go back to my moms today and I don’t really want to bring blanket back over there or at least sneaking it over there and saying I left it at my dad. I’m tired of not getting to use it whenever I want and also I just don’t want to share it because something about a sharing blanket all the time feels gross to me.

UPDATE: Several people have informed me that it is very dangerous for a child to use an adult size weighted blanket, so I guess the whole thing doesn’t matter now. I’ll just help my sister find a kid sized one.

Also sorry about calling the meltdowns she was having tantrums. Still learning about correct terminology.

Thanks for all the suggestions for places to get blankets guys, but I think everyone already named everyplace that exists. The amount of comments is getting a little insane for me so I’m gonna sign off now. Thanks again.",False,1570332838.0,2019-10-05 17:50:52
AITA for snapping at a barista after she woke up my sleeping baby twice?,11386,Asshole,1832,h15hvp,1591930567.0,"The coffee shop near my house just reopened, so I went in for a coffee on my afternoon walk with my 9 month old daughter yesterday. It wasn't busy, but because there were only 3 baristas (only 2 serving customers) working the service was slow. That's fine, I wasn't in a rush. But the second I walked in, I was struck by how loud their coffee grinder was. It wasn't just shut off in a few seconds though, but kept going and going, since the 3rd barista was grinding a HUGE bag of coffee all at once. Within the first minute my daughter wakes up and keeps screaming no matter how much I try to comfort her. After 5 minutes, I ask the barista if she could stop using the coffee grinder as it's disturbing my baby, and she agrees and turns off the machine.

While I'm waiting for my drink, I manage to get my daughter to start dozing again, until the barista turns on the grinder AGAIN, making my daughter cry all over again. At this point I snap at the barista for turning it on when I'm still there, as she can clearly see that she has caused my daughter to cry again. The barista says she was doing something else with the grinder that was more urgent, but could she have really not waited until I left? Anyways, the other baristas were extremely cold to me and didn't even say anything when they gave me my drink.

I emailed the manager when I got home explaining the situation, and today the manager replied and apologized for what happened. In return I got a free gift card. I was telling my husband this thinking he would be excited about the gift card, but he doesn't think I should have emailed the manager at all, and that I overreacted.

AITA for telling my friend who can’t seem to let go of her late miscarriage that she is neglecting her other child?,11340,Not the A-hole,1289,f220xc,1581419049.0,"

Two years ago, a good friend of mine miscarried her daughter at around 18 weeks. It was a terrible time for her, and it broke her a bit. She chose to deal with it by starting an Instagram where she documents her loss, and for a while that helped. She started to referred to her as having been “born sleeping”, which is baffling to me (I believe that you shouldn’t sugar coat grief/death) but I figured that whatever gets her through the next year was fine, and I did my best to be supportive.

Since then, it’s become her identity. She always talks about it, her “journey”, and her “angel baby in heaven”. Hardly anything else! She even threw a birthday party twice for her daughter.  With a cake and candles!!! The first one I understood, but with the second one....felt ghoulish. I’ve experienced miscarriages (one at 14 weeks, another fairly early on) myself, and while it sucked, it was no great cataclysm, and I got over it rather quickly. I understand not everyone is like this, and that everyone heals on their own timeline, but I think that something is very wrong.

Her house has turned into a shrine for the daughter. Her hospital pictures are EVERYWHERE, and her nursery remains untouched. I would totally just let it go as harmless eccentricity except for the fact that she has a five year old son. He’s such a great kid, but it’s become clear that he is less of a priority to her than her grief. He appears on her social media, but never as like “just her son”, it’s always as “her brother” being graveside, holding the body in the hospital, posed next to a bigger picture of her face, etc. He’s become more of a prop than a person. 

Sometimes she’ll post pictures on her phone of the daughter  (she has SO many from that day, the funeral, etc), while the son tugs at her, begging her to play, and she will ignore him. It’s like she cares more about someone who never even lived than the boy she watched grow up. Her husband works a lot, and she is a SAHM, so while he does his best with the son, but you can tell that the son needs his mom.

Last week, she called me in tears because the son had destroyed some of the framed photos of his sister, and she had found him “destroying the nursery”. She said that she punished him, and told me she had no idea why he would disrespect his sister like that. I told her that “you would probably lose it too if you felt like you were competing with a ghost”, and that her obsession with her daughter is delusional, unhealthy and endangering her relationship with her VERY alive son. She lost it at me, saying I couldn’t possibly understand how she feels, etc. I told her that she needs to accept that her daughter died, and work through it. I urged her to get treatment, or to at least have her son see someone because her neglectful actions are setting him up for psychological damage.  She hung up on me, and though I’ve tried to call her back, she refuses to take my calls.

WIBTA for kicking my sister out because she keeps commenting on how my wife and I raise our children?,11337,Not the A-hole,1520,ez10pq,1580894432.0,"My wife and I have three children. Our son, the oldest, is eight, and our daughters, the twins, are four. 

My wife's side of the family is very health-oriented, as we are. When our son started eating solids, his aunt gifted us with a set of dishes she had made to match the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate (she has also given a set to nearly everyone else in the family, as they're a big hit). We use them for all meals at home.  

We also do things like having water at most meals, although we also have a cabinet overflowing with different kinds of tea. We don't have sugary drinks such as Coke or juice in the house. If we have sweets, they are homemade and are usually things such as black bean brownies or oatmeal crumble in place of cobbler.

We do not make our children workout, but my wife and I do so in our living room, so they see us and grow up with the idea of it being normal. They like to join us, especially our son, who was very proud of being the only student in his grade to pass the school's fitness test for the past two years. 

We talk about nutrition and that sort of thing with the kids, especially when we go grocery shopping. We let our son pack his lunch, but he has to follow the same guidelines as any other meal; basically half a plate of veggies, some fruit, a type of whole grain, and a healthy protein. For example, today, he took a peanut butter sandwich, applesauce, baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, cauliflower, and pickles.  

So on and so forth.

My sister moved in with us in October. She lost her job and had a bad breakup. She needed a place to stay, and she felt that a change of scenery would be good too. 

My wife and I were hesitant to let her. My sister is, to put it politely, on the opposite side of healthy living. She is the sort of person who drinks a 6pack of Coke within two days, if not one. 

It is worse than we expected. She is constantly commenting on everything, from the fact that I don't make our mom's pork chops and fried potatoes for breakfast every Sunday or why we don't own a deep fryer. 

It has gotten much worse recently, with her making several rude comments about my wife's weight, including accusing her of bulimia when my wife had the stomach flu, and implying that we are raising our kids to have eating disorders as well.

We are now thinking about throwing her out, but she has not been able to find stable work (she is a journalist). She has had brief one-off gigs, but nothing reliable. 

We have had several conversations with her before and during her stay, so I know talking won't help. 

So, WIBTA for kicking her out?

When they announced that they were going to use her savings as a one time ""scholarship"" for a person in our area who wants to be teacher, I thought it was a sweet idea but I asked my parents if they wouldn't mind setting it aside for my future. My mother said that they felt that helping someone like my sister was the best way to honor her since ""I'm not even sure you could get into a college that would need that much money"". This felt like a slap in the face and I told her so. She said that she was just being realistic.",False,False,2020-05-07 16:25:39
AITA for cutting my niece’s tuition after she adopted some offensive beliefs?,11312,Not enough info,2358,en90gx,1578786633.0,"This one needs a little background. I (40sF) have two younger brothers. We were raised in a very conservative Christian home (think early evangelical movement). My brother “Sam” was pretty obviously gay, but he had a lot of shame and forced himself to marry a woman from church. They had my niece (now 19F). Unfortunately, my brother made some bad choices, and he developed a drug habit which caused him to OD when my niece was four. Our parents are now deceased, and my other brother is career military and gone a lot. I’ve done the best of my siblings, and I have a well paying job and plenty of savings. I have no children.

Because of these circumstances, we (my SIL, niece, brother, and I) are a very close knit family. I’ve always helped my SIL financially here and there, and I’m paying my niece’s tuition at a state university. She’s a good student, and I’m happy to relieve the burden on her mom.

The problem: my niece is getting involved with a pretty conservative Christian group on campus. She was not raised religious, and I’m an atheist, but I respect that some people find religion meaningful and enriching. However, I feel like she’s been adopting homophobic and sexist attitudes (e.g. “complementarity” of the sexes), and I think it’s coming from the group. She also opposes marriage equality now, on the grounds of religious freedom. This could just be a teen rebellion thing, but she doesn’t know her dad was gay. I can imagine how much he’d hurt if he were alive.

I’ve tried to argue it out with her, but she always deflects. Now, I’m considering pulling her spring tuition in order to make my point. I don’t want her going to university if it’s making her a crueler, more ignorant person. That’s not the purpose of education.

AITA for telling my wife I don't want her mother in the delivery room when our 1st child is born?,11310,Asshole,4091,dl14rw,1571695932.0,"My wife and I are expecting our first in May.  We've been together 10+ with 7 of them married so naturally we've discussed all things baby, family, etc.  One of the things that has come up before is the day of our little ones arrival.  I've stated in no uncertain terms that I believe the only ones in the delivery room outside of medical professionals should be her and I.  My wife however, has expressed that she'd like her mother to be in the room.  We haven't discussed this in some time and definitely not since finding out we're expecting, but I do anticipate the topic coming around again soon.

I take issue with my MIL being there bc while she has been very supportive throughout the process (unsuccessful attempts for years followed by several rounds of IVF) I'm of the opinion that this is one of those bonding moments for us and us alone since we are the ones directly involved in this event.  I'm not saying she shouldn't be at the hospital, or even come in to see her before the procedure begins - I'm fine with all of that.  But when it comes time for the main event so to speak, I feel it's time for her to head to the waiting room.  I want this time alone with my wife to laugh, to cry, to enjoy our child privately before they become a spectacle for everyone else.

I've learned quickly that pregnancy hormones are a very real thing, so I'm not entirely certain what to expect when this conversation happens again.  So I'm wondering AITA if I stick to my guns on this one, or am I better off taking one for the team, sucking it up and letting my MIL (in my opinion) ruin the moment.

My job has a men’s and women’s bathroom like most places, I don’t know what the women’s is like but the men’s only has one stall. I go in and there a guy in it so I wait, and just as he’s getting out an obviously pregnant woman throws the door open and tries to push past me into the stall. At this point I’d been waiting to go for a decent while, and I didn’t know how long I was going to be able to wait. Additionally, it’s pretty annoying that she just ran in, didn’t knock or warn anybody, and just assumed she could use the stall. I couldn’t just sprint into a women’s bathroom with no consequences.

So I said I was next and went in before her. She yelled(well not quite yelled, it was like the volume level below) she had to go so I said go to the women’s. She said it was full and so I said sorry, but there’s nothing I can do. I did my business and I heard her leave I probably took 5-7 minutes, not too long.

Well she told some of my coworkers and now they’re all up on me about being rude to a pregnant woman and selfishly not letting her have the bathroom. I’ve explained my digestion problem but they say I could have waited and let her go. I *might* have been able to wait, I don’t know.

AITA for not supporting my mom in old age because her insistence on being SAHM her whole life had essentially killed my dad?,11321,Not the A-hole,1321,f7lv9a,1582366059.0,"Heavy topic but I need some perspective on if I’m doing the right thing.

So I’ve got two other siblings and growing up my parents were mostly comfortable for a long time when we were young. My mom was a SAHM her entire life. When I turned 12 (I was the youngest) my dad lost his job during the financial downturn and we really struggled. My mom could have worked, but didn’t, even though my brothers and I were all in school. 

My dad never got as high paying of a job subsequently but my mom never cut down on her spending and never got a job. I distinctly remember coming home for college and seeing my dad break down over bills because they were heavily in debt at this time. My mom still never worked and would resort to very bullshit, borderline sexist answers as to why she wouldn’t (ie “I gave him 3 kids. The least he could do is support us.”) 

3 years ago my dad passed away because of a largely stress/lifestyle induced heart attack. My mom encouraged him to move 6 hours away to work a high pressure job in a new city to try to earn more money. Between never seeing his family, living in a tiny apartment, and getting terrible sleep because of his hours, he died alone and we never got to say goodbye. The worst part is I found out recently my mom didn’t allow him to fly home as frequently as he liked to “save money.” I suspect he was heavily depressed the last few months of his life.

Starting last year my mom started begging my brothers and I for money because she has no job and no source of income obviously. My brothers send money home every month but I refuse to. I tell her she could do ANYTHING to support herself, she’s only 52, but she very pitifully asks me if I want to see her bagging groceries. 

My brothers think I need to contribute because she’s mom and she’s just how she is. I don’t want to and occasionally feel like an ass for saying no. My boyfriend supports me but it feels like he’s the only person who does. AITA?",False,False,2020-02-22 02:07:39

I love her very much and I consider her to be family, but first and foremost my stepdaughters father is heavily involved in her life and he is a great dad. She already has a father, and for years both her dads side and my wife’s side of the family have felt the need to ‘drum it into me’ that I will never ever be a father, just moms husband. 

Over time I guess their mental POV has shifted because now my wife and her family wish for me to start referring to my stepdaughter as my daughter. However she is not expected to refer to me as dad. 

I don’t *really* have an issue with this but I am uncomfortable because I don’t view her as my daughter, I actually view her as a younger family never that i take care of.

AITA for giving my twin sons different allowances?,11285,Asshole,2493,fxbnct,1586398650.0,"I (43M) have four kids. The two oldest are twin boys (both 14M) and then we have two girls (10F and 7F). All of them are pretty responsible kids, and consistently do their chores as they're meant to. We have a little chart that says what all their jobs are, with each of their roles being proportional to their ages. The boys take on the largest number of responsibilities, which each of them alternating jobs every week. 

Officially, their allowances have been as follows for a while:

Boys: both $15 a week

10-year-old: $10

7-year-old: $2, mostly for symbolic purposes lol

Obviously, as the girls age, they'll start making more money, just as they'll start doing more work around the house.

But here's the thing. One of my boys (call him A to differentiate) is a real leader in the home. He's just naturally brilliant with people, is constantly dealing with conflicts between his sisters and his brother, takes charge in rough situations, and is really considerate of others. He's always been the ""frontman"" between his brother and him, with him speaking for both of them while his brother hangs back. Though we've never told him to, and though it's not his responsibility, he's always been a real help to his mother and me in keeping the house running smoothly. His brother (call him B), on the other hand, is much more reserved. He keeps to himself. That's not a problem, but we do recognize that A takes on more ""emotional labor"" in the household than B. 

So, my wife and I have been giving A an extra $5 a week for the past year, so he's been making $20 while B's been making $15. We think that's fair, since A's taken on more responsibilities in the house, even if they weren't responsibilities we told him to take on. The boys both have debit cards (got them when they were 13), so we put the money directly into their accounts and neither of them see money getting exchanged. A does know he makes more money, though.

Last week, however, B found out his brother was making more money than him. They were online shopping for video games, and B questioned why A was able to afford stuff he couldn't (A hasn't really spent his extra money, so it's accumulated a fair bit). A admitted to him that he's been making more.

B is absolutely furious with us. He says that it's totally unfair that they've been doing the same amount of chores, but A's been making more money. But we don't really know how to explain to him that A deserves recognition for the less easily quantifiable work he does in our family.

I decided not to cut my step family out of my life.  My second question if I was TA if I go or not and people say its up to me.  So I went to my step mom's place for christmas, this was my first time with my step mom and step sister without my dad. It was super hard cause I sat in the seat he always sat on and I just broke down crying. I am forever grateful for both my step sister and step mom cause we all just had a group hug on her couch while I bawled my eyes out. It ended and we didn't open presents but just talked. We had brunch and it went well tho I was holding in tears for the whole thing, this was the first time I could see they actually do care for me and I care for them. They are my family, I didn't stay the night cause I def couldn't do that but I left around 11 at night. This was the first time I ever felt like a full family unit and not the bad kid who fought with my step mom was just wasn't the nicest to my step sister. I thank them so much for not holding a grudge when I went through my teen rebel phase. I hugged them both goodbye and went home, I feel like me giving them a shot and going to my dad's place helped me realize that these are the people who have always been there for me. I mean they were the ones who didn't give up on me when I was a troubled teen and I love them both for it. I text my step sister almost daily now even if its just a good morning or I have the day off and I call my step mom a bit too now but it goes a bit deeper and I've started to really trust her like a mom.  

Thank you all for the advice and to not cut them out cause it really did help me realize that we ARE a family.  We have been since I was 8 and I love and care for both of them very much.

AITA For ignoring the co worker that reported me to HR which is leading to her likely being fired,11265,Not the A-hole,1380,fbgvqy,1583030260.0,"Obligatory statement that I am not an English speaker, anyway here goes.

3 weeks ago a new person got hired at my job, which was a bit odd given the job is extremely specialized and requires a certain skillset and she has none of them but regardless me and my co workers did our best to welcome her and after a few days I more or less became became her mentor because she was hopelessly unprepared and unskilled for the job, but she was a nice girl as such I had no problem going the extra mile to help her out. She soon became friends with me and the people at work.

However all of that stopped at the start of week 2, I got called in to my boss' office and got told an HR complaint was filed against me for sexual harrassment. I was terrified and racking my brain at what I may have done but could not come up with anything. After asking my boss what it was about multiple time he told me the new girl had filed the complaint and it was a bit unclear.

Well I ended up trying to think about what I may have done but again could not come up with anything so I decided to ask her.

She told me ""I was laying it on thick the other day"" confused I asked her what she meant and she says I was flirting with her, I told her I wasn't interested in her and was only being friendly, I didn't do anything weird or flirty but she said I had been flirting since she started working there. Again I denied it stating I had no clue what she was talking about and explained the fact I am in a relationship, not remotely attracted to her and asked for specific examples, after this she seemed offended by me saying I am not remotely attracted to her and I just walked off as she wasn't answering and asked some of my other co workers(Who'm are mostly female) if I did anything weird as during basically all interactions I had with new girl at least one of my co workers was also there, they all said I acted no different then usual and were weirded out that she went to HR.

As a result my only real idea is that she interpreted me being male + being friendly and talkative as flirting and decided to go straight to HR about it.

Now I obviously no longer wanted to deal with her out of fear of her misinterpreting stuff I did and getting fired, I like my job after all. 

Well now week 3 is over and she is on thin ice, everyone has stopped helping her, she has no idea what to do half the time and has begged me to help her multiple times, but I have just ignored her or only answered with ""I am not comfortable helping you.""

Last friday she came to me again asking me to please help her as she can't afford to lose her job as she is a single mother and she realky needs this job and no one else will help her, but again I declined and walked away.

AITA for blowing up at my husband's brother for how he declined donating sperm to us?,11252,Not the A-hole,1802,dle56e,1571756190.0,"**I want to make it very clear that this isn't about him saying no, it's about how he declined. If he'd just said no, this wouldn't be a conversation.**

My husband and I have been trying for kids for a while. He, as it turns out, has azoospermia, which is no sperm. We've been taking about donors, and he's only comfortable with it if it comes from his brother. Adoption isn't something we could possibly afford right now, and I don't love the idea of a 3rd party getting to call all the shots about us having children. Eric has donated before in college and currently has a son with a girlfriend. He's a little smarmy and self important, but not a bad person. So we asked him, and now I have regrets. 

He sent a very detailed email in which he went into excruciating detail of all the reasons he felt we wouldn't be good parents, and what we'd ""need to change"" before he would ""give us"" a child. At the risk of making this post as long as the email itself, there were two main points. 

1. He didn't feel that our income was high enough. He demanded to see financial records. He wanted to see his brother more advanced/settled in a career, and wanted to know my career trajectory as well. Both of us have been in the same companies for 5+ years, and don't have dead end jobs. He also wanted us in a house and not an apartment. 

2. He felt that I and his brother needed to get therapy for ""being different"". Along this line, he wanted his brother to ""act more normal"". We would also need to convert and follow their family's religion and ""not be a heathen"". 

I was furious when I received this. HE COULD HAVE JUST SAID NO. That he acted like the sole way for us to have children and like he could control our lives is ridiculous. I don't want to adopt BECAUSE I don't want to have a third party telling me what my standards are. I'd rather be childless.

AITA for telling my friend that being gay doesn’t give him a free pass?,11967,Not the A-hole,956,hip6al,1593558690.0,"Title is really bad, but hear me out. 

Note: we are not in the US, we are in Europe (not gonna specific for obvious reasons)

My best friend and roommate, A, has been engaged to her fiancé, B, for about two years. They were scheduled to get married in May, but for obvious reasons, it didn’t happen. They instead got married this past weekend in our backyard with only about twenty people present, all of them being our closest friends, and their parents respectively (For those wondering, they wanted to get married soon because A is pregnant and they decided why not). 

One of our friends, J, brought along his boyfriend, G, to the ceremony. J and G have been dating for five years, and currently live together and are honestly a sweet couple. After A and B exchanged their vows and we started a small reception for them, J suddenly made an announcement and proposed to G - not even ten minutes after A and B exchanged vows and were announced as husband and wife. 

Everyone sort of congratulated them, but there was a tension in the air. J and G were sat with me, eating, and J said that B had called him a jerk for proposing and J said ‘I always knew that ass was homophobic’. I was taken aback and I said, as carefully as I could, that being gay had nothing to do with it, it was the fact that he proposed at a wedding. 

J got defensive and said that the romantic moment swept him up and he felt it was time. G tried to calm him down, but J said that he was so disappointed I was homophobic as well. I kinda got mad and defensive, and I said that being gay doesn’t give him a pass to stomp on politeness at a wedding and propose barely after the bride and groom got married and that being gay wasn’t a free pass in general. J and G left, and I got a message from J on Sunday that G was reconsidering their relationship all because of me and B ‘ruining his proposal’. Our friends are kind of split, saying that while J was in the wrong for proposing at a wedding, I shouldn’t have mentioned their sexuality at all, and just said ‘proposals shouldn’t happen at weddings unless okayed by bride and groom’ but I disagree. From what I gathered, J thought he could get away with it just because he and G are in a gay relationship, but no matter the relationship, proposing at a wedding is in bad taste. I cannot see how my comment was homophobic, but I may need an outside perspective.

AITA for refusing to bake my pregnant SIL a baby shower cake even though I’ve baked cakes for all my other sisters/SILs?,11222,Not the A-hole,1165,gbs3mu,1588401624.0,"So I’ve got a massive family, one of 6 siblings. My youngest brother got married last year and his wife is now pregnant with their first baby. She was planning on having a big baby shower sometime over the summer and wanted me to be in charge of baked goods (cake, cupcakes, etc). 

I’m a big baking hobbyist and I make a lot of very extravagant cakes for family/friends. This has always been a thing of mine and I’ve probably made more than 100 big event cakes for people over the years. I’ve always done it for free as a gift to people as well. 

The issue is SIL recently approached me about her baby shower cake and after thinking about it I called her to say I won’t be able to make it for her. The reason being that a few years ago she asked me to make a bday cake for her niece and it was a disastrous moment. My SIL is extremely picky/perfectionist and treated me like a hired caterer. It was a supremely unpleasant memory being so micromanaged and getting constant criticism that she swore was constructive. I remember breaking down at one point because I wanted it to be over so much but couldn’t back out so late. Afterwards I did tell her about how I was upset over the experience and she told me to be less sensitive (specifically she texted me “I think this is a good learning experience for you if you ever want to be a professional. Nothing I’ve said has been mean-spirited. It was all to help you be better.”)

So this time I told her I’m not baking any cakes soon (this is true. I’m in poor health and I’m not baking for anyone). But this has really offended her because she knows for a fact I’ve made baby shower cakes for all my sisters’ pregnancies as well as other SILs. She sent me a really long email the other day saying she’s disappointed in me excluding her during such a big milestone and that she’ll remember how I treated her in the future. She also CC’d my mom and sisters who later texted me to say SIL is insane and has texted them all individually to discuss how unreasonable I’m being.

My husband is urging me to just make the damn cake to keep the peace but the more I think about it the more I don’t want to. I’ve normally been kind of a pushover about these things but I truly hate how SIL treated me during the last cake commission and I don’t want to go through another one. I hate engaging with her because she always makes me feel so small and like an idiot who needs help. Even her last email was lecturing me about what a bad person I was being.

Currently she’s unemployed because her job permanently shut down due to the lockdown so the income comes from me and her unemployment. I make good money so I don’t care if she gets another job, I can support us.

Money is a little tight lately because we very suddenly had to buy a new car. We haven’t really spent any personal money, only money on groceries and necessities. 

Last night my fiancée came into our bathroom while I was shaving and looked a little nervous. She asked if she could buy a $350 wedding dress that she’s been looking at for months. I kind of looked at her and asked where the $350 would come from. She said we had a lot of money in our savings we hadn’t touched, and it would barely make a dent in our savings. I thought about it for a second and told her if she gets to splurge $350 on a dress I get to spend $350 on whatever I want. 

She said she didn’t think it was a splurge, it was for our wedding and I could buy what I wanted but i could tell I had hurt her feelings. I told her spending $350 on a dress was a little ridiculous, and she started crying and walked out of the bathroom quietly. 

When I walked into our bedroom she was under the covers and facing away from me. We haven’t talked since. I don’t feel like I’m being unreasonable but AITA?



Edit: I never really looked at how much dresses are. They really are expensive and that’s a shock. We paid our whole wedding and I knew that would be expensive, but since dresses are her thing and I’m not supposed to see them, I never looked.

I love my fiancée and I want her to feel beautiful. I feel like a total asshole. I just assumed wedding dresses weren’t that much unless they were like custom made or a celebrity dress.

Edit #2: the way we’ve always done things in our relationship is if I splurge on x amount of money, she gets to as well, we always have, even before she lost her job. So that was my mindset. Which was not the mindset I should have had.


Last edit: we’ve talked about it. I’ve apologized. We’re good.

My account was pretty much a secret for a very long time because I didn't want to be judged for it by friends and coworkers. But now a very big makeup brand reposted one of my pictures to their instagram page and that's how my friends found out about it.

When I came into work about a month ago some of my coworkers told me that they had seen the picture of me and therefore found out about my page. Most of them were pretty respectful and nice about it.

My boss also witnessed this interaction so he also now knew about my page. Apparently he took a look at my instagram account on his own phone because later on he confronted me about it.

A little background before I get into the confrontation: I never wear any makeup to work. I put on a tinted lip balm and rarely wear mascara or concealer if I have dark circles under my eyes. That's it.

My boss then showed me some of the pictures of my makeup looks and then asked me if I could start wearing these kind of looks to work because it would really look good for him and the restaurant if the servers put a lot of effort into their appearance.

I told him that I never wear these kinds of looks in ""real life"" and only do them because it's my hobby. I also told him that I have really sensitive skin so I don't wear makeup on a daily basis to give my skin a break. 

My boss them repeated that me wearing makeup would make the restaurant look good and that I should at least think about it.

So now I have to return to work in two weeks and I honestly, I don't want to wear any makeup to work. But would that make me TA? I don't want to anger my boss by not making his restaurant look good.

AITA for kicking my aunt out from a family gathering after she said that my 3 year old son deserved to accidentally hurt himself?,11168,Not the A-hole,907,fgi0jz,1583892034.0,"I (27M) never really liked my aunt (52F). She didn't really treat me well when I was a kid, always called me names and she basically despised me so much, despite us barely seeing each other. So we've always had a rough and strained relationship.

So I hosted a family gathering at my house, mainly because it's been a while and partially to try and at least mend things since she **is** my aunt at the end of the day. So everyone arrived and things were going smoothly. Let's skip to the AITA part.

My 3 year old son was playing around with his cousins in the garden under my supervision. You know, usual toddler things (running around recklessly, chasing each other). My son in particular was being loud but I didn't really mind. My aunt kept on telling them to shut up and I told her that they're kids and they're playing around, no need to tell them to shut up. This went back and forth for a bit and eventually I had my way.

My son then tripped on a rock and fell on the ground face first, causing his top lip to bleed. I picked him up and brought him and the other kids inside and told them that play time is over. While I was attending to him, my aunt, out of frustration, then comes up with this:

A: Serves him right. He won't be so loud and annoying next time.

I turned around and said ""You what?"" and she repeated herself like it was completely OK to say that and said that this incident will serve as a good lesson for him. That done it. I told her to get the f**k out of my house and that me kicking her out will ""serve as a good lesson"" for her not to say shit like that again. Eyes were now facing my direction.

She was baffled and had nothing else to say. To my surprise, she left without saying a single word. My family was shocked and not long after, everyone started leaving. The last to leave were my parents who, while on their way out, said that I let my emotions get the better of me and I shouldn't have immediately kicked her out like that.

It's not like I have a wife/girlfriend to talk to about this, because I'm a single father. AITA?",False,1583864854.0,2020-03-10 19:00:34

Last year when we got our tax return we desperately needed a car, instead he spent a good chuck of our money on a motorcycle. Leaving me and our children with out transportation. I reluctantly agreed to him buying it on one condition, that I never wanted to hear him complain if he had to ride in the rain. 
Fast forward we have a crappy car and his bike, and every time I have a day off from work he wants to take my car to work and throws a fit when I’d rather him not. I have things I need to do And it’s so rare I get a day off during the week. He feels like I’m not being a good wife because there is a chance it will rain today. But I don’t see why I have to put all the errands off and be stranded at home all day because he just HAD to get a motorcycle. Am i the asshole?

AITA for being mad about being called a Karen?,11148,Not the A-hole,1578,gedd8n,1588768550.0,"So I’ve been feeling terrible lately. Severe heartburn that feels like I’m burping acid, nausea the lasts all day, lower back pain, headaches, etc. Before you ask, no, I’m not pregnant. This has been going on for about a week. Can’t get in to see the Dr til next week, but they think I have an ulcer so they sent in nausea meds and something for the heartburn to help until I can get checked out. My husband volunteered to go get it. For which I’m grateful. He gets there and they tell him they are out of the medicine. The girl does a search on the computer to find the closest pharmacy that has the meds in stock. Apparently it says they have it so she does some “computer magic” and gets the script filled. I’m getting text updates while all this is going on. First it says “your script Pantoprazole is being processed” then it says “your script for Pantoprazole is out of stock and being ordered” THEN it says “your script for Pravachol has been filled “ so when my husband gets home I check the medication. Sure enough, wrong medicine. I say something and hubby tells me to just take it as it’s what was prescribed. I tell him it’s wrong. So I call pharmacy and they have no clue how it happened. I ask if the two are the same. Nope. Not even close. I call the dr back and ask for them to resend the correct medicine. Out of curiosity I ask about what I was given vs what I should have gotten. Long story short, if I HAD taken the medicine I would most likely have ended up in the ER due to known interactions with other meds I take. I get off the phone and hubby asks if I’m “done being a Karen yet” I tried to explain to him why I was upset and he just rolled his eyes and said “whatever Karen” I got pissed and ended up yelling at him. He gets mad about that and says I should’ve known he was joking and calls me a dick. 
He says stuff like this all the time and calls me a hypochondriac among other things. Most conversations tend to end up with it all being my fault for “not being able to take a joke” Am I a Karen?

Edit: I actually happy/relieved cried reading some of your comments. I’m glad to know I’m not a total asshole or a Karen, but it’s made me realize that we probably need therapy. I’m gonna get on that first thing in the morning. Thank you",True,1588748035.0,2020-05-06 05:35:50

AITA for changing my name after my husband died?,11117,Not the A-hole,985,esle02,1579769765.0,"My husband and I were married for 3 years. He died in a car accident 8 months ago. It was absolutely devastating.

When we got married, I took his last name. I didn’t want to that badly but talked myself into it. Sharing a family name is so nice and I wasn’t interested in hyphenating. Getting used to a new name is weird. I really love my family and they have been a huge support through this whole ordeal. I do like my husbands family but I was never particularly close to them. 

I made the decision to go back to my maiden name. Since my husband is gone, we have no kids and I’m not close to his family I didn’t think it was that big of a deal. It’s my name - I have to live with it and I want to share a name with my family who are super important to me.

My former in-laws freaked when they found out. They said I was being disrespectful to my husbands memory and to them. They said it looks like I’m trying to erase him from my history. Some of my husbands friends expressed disappointment as well.

I think that’s an overreaction. I will always love and miss my husband. I don’t think my last name changes that. AITA? Is it disrespectful?

EDIT: this really blew up overnight. Thank you all for your kind words.
In the comments I mentioned that I changed my name on Facebook. The only people who knew about my name change before this were my mom and sister. I didn’t include this info in the original post because it didn’t seem important. If my in-laws had an issue with it, they didn’t express that to me. They are upset about the name change itself. I’m not sure what the protocol is for changing your name. I didn’t tell anyone ahead of time when I changed it the first time. Making some announcement to people like you do when you get engaged or pregnant didn’t seem right since this isn’t exactly a life changing event.

I (22M) was invited to a party by a friend of mine. I got talking to a woman (21F) and we were getting on quite well. She started getting a bit flirty and touchy which was fine because I reciprocated and flirted back... so all was going well until she said:

""You're really good looking for an Indian guy""

This felt very much like a backhanded ""compliment"". It stung and felt racist to me. So I said to her ""I've got no time for racists"" and left. 

Afterwards, my friend (who invited me to the party) texted me calling me AH for calling her friend a racist... it's worth noting that both my friend and the girl who said that comment to me about being good looking are white. I just don't think that they understand what racism feels like.

"AITA for calling my child's teacher ""culturally insensitive"" when she tried to order us not to use a nickname at home?",11098,Not the A-hole,795,fx9wuz,1586393080.0,"My side of the family and I call my 6yo daughter ""chubby birdy"". She likes the nickname: it's based on a favorite picture of hers, and even before she could speak properly, she was obsessed with it because of the alliteration (I'm guessing).

A few days ago, she asked how to stay ""chubby birdy"" in English. Turns out she told her class that her mother's side of the family calls her that. A day later I got a gentle scolding email from her teacher that we shouldn't call her that because of body issues it could cause. In my reply, I thanked her for her concern, acknowledged that body issues were an issue even for such young girls, explained the nickname, and promised I'd discuss with her that it's personal and she should be careful about calling other people by nicknames they didn't ask for. I wasn't offended at all by the teacher's email, and I thought my response was very polite.

But then I got a much harsher reply. She told me I was setting up my daughter for a lifetime of body issues, and though ""[my] culture"" might be okay with ""fat-shaming"", ""in America,"" that is not acceptable. I should be ashamed of myself for using such a nickname, and teaching my daughter to hide it was even worse. For the record, I was born and raised in the US, but my parents immigrated from Eastern Europe in their 20s. My husband is from East Asia, and my daughter has his last name (though I don't). So I'm not completely sure whose culture she was referring to.

Most of my response was in a very polite, understanding tone. I explained that in my parents culture, there was recent memory of not enough food. My grandmother lived through a famine and lost several relatives to it, and though my parents' generation had it much better, they still had to wait in line for food and knew nothing of the abundance of the US. A child with chubby cheeks was a wonderful sign because it meant they were well fed. But then I finished it off by calling her ""culturally insensitive"" for projecting American hang-ups about weight onto my multicultural family. She hasn't replied.

On the one hand, it seems shitty to use the shit my family endured for this petty squabble. On the other hand, it's true. My grandmother (and to a lesser extent, my mother) is obsessed with making sure my daughter is well-fed probably for just these reasons. My husband thinks I shouldn't have used the ""culturally sensitive"" in particular because Americans gets very upset at being told they're racist/unaware. He thinks it could cause issues with the teacher in the future if I've offended her.",False,False,2020-04-08 17:44:40
AITA for sleeping in my roommates bed for a week after my boyfriend puked red wine all over mine?,11225,Asshole,2017,h0yque,1591908779.0,"My roommate and I (both 20f) don’t know each other that well. We have mutual friends who both knew we needed roommates at the beginning of the year, so set us up. We’re not in the apartment at the same time very often, so I wouldn’t say we’re friends, but we don’t dislike each other. 

At the beginning of last week, my roommate told me she was going to go back to her hometown (about 2 hours away) because her dad was sick and she wanted to be with her family. I said okay, see you when you’re back, the usual. That night, I invited my boyfriend over and we ended up getting a bit drunk, which resulted in him puking red wine all over my bed. It was like 3am at this point, and I was tipsy, so I dragged him over to my roommates bed and we both fell asleep. 

The next morning my boyfriend went home, but I was hungover and didn’t want to wash my sheets yet, so I just stayed in my roommates bed. I ended up sleeping and staying in my roommates bed for the rest of the week. 

She came back to the apartment on Monday whilst I was out shopping, and I came back to her questioning as to why there was a phone charger on her bed. I told her that I’d been sleeping in her bed because of the red wine puke, expecting her to just find it amusing, but she was absolutely disgusted and called me a slob because I didn’t wash my sheets.

I was there for all of 5 minutes while a guy who worked there (late 20s M) put the wipers on. We had a short, friendly conversation and then I paid and went on my way, thinking nothing of it. 

However, later that evening, I received a text from a number identifying himself as the guy from the dealership. He basically said he had a great time talking to me, and was hoping that we could meet up some time to talk again in the future. 

This made me really uncomfortable because I never gave him my phone number. He must have gotten it from my profile with the dealership. I feel like that’s a breech of privacy on his part, and if he wanted to shoot his shot he could’ve just done it while I was there in person. 

So WIBTA if I report him? I would have no doubt about it if he had made me uncomfortable during our irl interaction, but we had a pleasant conversation.

AITA for not encouraging my son to call my wife “mom”?,11198,Not the A-hole,1458,hibe6k,1593501767.0,"I’m 31 and my son is 7. My fiancé, his mom, passed away when he was born due to complications. I wanted to keep her memory alive so since he was an infant, I told him all about his mom and constantly showed him pictures of her. 

I always told my son she went up to heaven and is now watching over him. We talk about death whenever he has questions about it so it’s something we‘re open about. He also has a really great relationship with her side of the family so that’s another way he’s connected to her.

I started dating my current wife when my son was just 3 but we waited a year before she officially met him. They both bonded instantly and my son adores her. 

Fast forward 3 years later, we’re now happily married. This issue happened right after her parents moved closer to our city. They were previously living across the country, so the only time they met me or my son face to face was at our wedding. 

They came over for Fathers Day for a small brunch. While we were all chatting, my son came in and asked “Mimi (my wife’s nickname) can you help me set up my PlayStation please?” 

Her mother immediately expressed how bothered she was that he still doesn’t called her mom even though we’ve been married over a year. I didn’t feel like it was a big deal but she refused to stop talking about it and it kinda ruined the afternoon.

A few days later, my wife said her mom keeps calling her over this and now she sort of agrees too. She said it’s hurtful that he still doesn’t see her as his mom after everything she’s done for him and doesn’t feel appreciated because I haven’t encouraged him to do so. 

My son does appreciate her though. He makes her cards every Mother’s Day and tells her how much he loves her. And it’s not like I never spoke to my son about this.

It was brought up at our wedding. He asked me if this meant he had to start calling her mom. I said only if he wants to and that I know mommy would be okay with him also calling my wife his mom. Just so he wouldn’t worry about that. 

He said okay and ran off to go play with his cousins and didn’t mention it again. I figured now that he knows it’s okay, he’ll call her mom when/if he was ready. 

She knows all this but said she still feels she deserves to be called “mom” especially since she’s been in his life longer than his mother. That comment struck a nerve and I told her to never say anything like that again. We had a big argument over this and now we’re not talking.

She still thinks she deserves for me to get him to start calling her mom and I believe he should do it on his own if he wants to. I understand where she’s coming from but I also don’t want to pressure him if that’s not what he wants to call her.

AITA for telling my wife she ‘had asked for it’ after our grandkids spilled juice and food on her £3000 sofas?,11076,Not the A-hole,654,fi589e,1584156349.0,"My wife and I have 5 kids, and 14 grandchildren. We are used to lots of noise, rubble and trouble and we are a close family. 

All our kids live very close by and we love having the children over, more or less every single day of the week there’s the kids over, and that’s how we both like it. 

My wife encourages it as we have 5 daughters and obviously she wants her girls close, so it’s a madhouse. 

She recently wanted to get rid of our sofas and get new ones because her friends have the same one. 

I was against it because we had lovely expensive California leather sofas that were in the lounge, but she overrode me and decided to get light cream cloth ones. 

I had some reservations and told her we have young kids running around all the time, we have 2 newborns in the family and the rest are 3-16 so very much in the messy phase of their lives. 

She said she’d deal with it as and when problems arose and the new sofas arrived just after Xmas. 

Since then I’ve taken extreme care to clean them properly and wipe them down. My wife isn’t too fussed and I usually do the cleaning anyway so I don’t think she realised how much work went into keeping them clean. 

I was out with my mates playing golf and she called me very cross because one of the kids had spilled juice on the sofa and his sister had spilled food as my wife was feeding them. I told her what products I used but sadly it was Ribena and it’s stained the sofa. 

My daughter paid to have the sofa professionally cleaned and no harm done but my wife has been annoyed by the event.

My twin sister, Grace, has 3 kids. David, 7, Adam, 9 & Rose, 13.

For the first decade of Rose's life she was raised by our parents (her grandparents), and when Adam was born he also came to live with them, because Grace couldn't afford to have them living with her. A few years ago Grace invited Adam and Rose to come back and live with her, saying she now had the time/money to take care of them. She ended up spoiling the boys but said that Rose, who had hit puberty, was a ""woman"" because of this and was expected to take on the same role Grace had, so Rose ended up basically being a live in nanny to her brothers.

It was our birthday yesterday, and we always have family dinner with our parents, spouses, and children, at our parent's home.

At one point Rose excuses herself, heads for the bathroom, and about 10 seconds later we hear her say ""what the FUCK"". Me, dad, and my husband all go to look and about a 3 feet up the wall is a large scribble in crayon. It starts at 3 feet up and the highest point of it is around 6 feet off the ground.

We go back to the table and tell the others what we saw. David immediately looks guilty.

Edit: at this point we ask the kids to leave the room, so it's just me,my sister, my husband and our parents at the table.

My kids are shorter than average, with Jacob barely being over 3.5 feet tall and Caroline being just about 3 feet. Neither are tall enough to have drawn 6 feet high.

David is a little over 4 feet tall, and he could have reached that high.

Grace immediately tells me that I shouldn't have brought Caroline and Jacob with me, of course something was going to happen.

I started explain that the height of the picture ruled out my kids, but she interrupted saying that of course I'm going to put the blame on her kids because my kids can do no wrong in my eyes.

I responded that my kids aren't angels. I'm not going to sit here and say they've never done anything wrong. But they know better than to draw on walls.

Grace then gets angry, saying that I am implying that she didn't raise her kids properly and how dare I accuse her children.

I say that Rose is great kid, but her sons have a history of doing stuff just like this. The drawing is too high up to be my kids, which leaves her boys to be the likely suspects.

Grace then says it has to be one of my ""brats"" who did it because she raised all of her children better than that.

In anger, I say ""you didn't fucking raise them!""

She gets quiet, collects her kids, and leaves. Rose refuses and stays with us. I end up cleaning up the mess on the wall and Jacob tells me that he saw David in the arts and crafts box. My parents want me to apologise to keep peace and Rose says that while she gets where I'm coming from, she's getting calls from her mum saying she needs to come home and complaining about me, so until I apologise Rose is dealing with it.

Update: David confessed to the drawing. Grace texted her saying David confessed and Rose should have watched him better and this would never have happened. Grace hasn't contacted me yet and has made it clear to Rose that she still expects an apology.

For people asking about CPS: We have social services here. I work in education, and I have a friend at social services.

AITA [Who is the asshole?] Brother upset I am not taking on childcare duties when we live together.,11066,Not the A-hole,4191,cki5bw,1564654677.0,"My brother Howard [32M] and I [24F] are renting a house from our father. Originally it was just me and a cousin, but Howard moved in when she left. Howard and his wife, Janis, have two kids. My niece [5F] and nephew [2M] spend half the week with one parent, and half the week with the other. Howard has them from Friday to Monday morning. 

The current problem—

I have tried to talk to my brother about his expectations of “help” and that I find them unreasonable. I am not the second parent in the household, I view us living together as roommates, not really a family unit. I am here until I finish school and can move out on my own. 

He wants to go to the gym or go out with friends, but the times he wants to go are during MY only free time. I feel like I shouldn't be asked to give up my free time when babysitters are available for that kind of thing--he is just too cheap to hire one. His argument, that he would do the same for me, is empty. I don't plan to have kids. He has insulted me for not dropping everything to watch his kids, calling me “selfish” and “shallow” for not helping him out. 

Howard says-- 

I have an issue with my sister not helping because we live together and we should, as a family, be willing to help when need be. I feel like she has done very little to help with the kids. 

She makes her own meals, but she doesn’t offer to help make meals for the kids. She is not home much, but when she is, she will order something small to the house and not ask if I want anything [I will give her $$$]. 

When I ask her to help me get the kids ready for something, she tells me no. We have gotten into arguments because she will see I am trying to get the kids ready and she just leaves, without even asking if I am okay. 

I need to get away from the kids sometimes. I have asked her to watch the kids while I get milk from the store. She says she will pick up the milk for me. When I tell her I need a minute alone, she says the offer is “I get the milk or nothing.” 

I am drowning in debt, I have a failing marriage, my kids are a lot, and my parents live far away. I just need some help and she has refused to be more than a passing stranger in their lives. I am hurt, overwhelmed, and resentful—which I don’t want to be. But I feel like she could help more, or even a little bit. 

Our dad has a pool in the back. She swims laps every morning. It was 90* here the other day and the kids wanted to swim. I had to take calls and asked if she would watch them for 20 minutes. She said, no she was finishing laps, making breakfast, and going out with friends. So she didn’t have time. I would desperately like some help. 

Conclusion—

We both think we are right and cannot think of a way to make the other person understand. Thanks for the help

AITA for taking the office microwave?,11060,Not the A-hole,1427,dp6p3q,1572470682.0,"Over a year ago the microwave at my office died. The company refused to replace it. They said we could use money we earned for prizes to go towards that. This would take a long time. 

I wasn't having that. At the time I went out and spent about sixty dollars on a microwave. Initially I kept it at my desk, but everyone kept coming to use it. So I moved it to the office kitchen. 

Everyone who saw it at my desk is gone. It's just been ""the microwave"". Anyway, my wife and I bought a new house recently and it needs a microwave. Our new home is close enough to the office that I can commute home during lunch. So I took my microwave home. Generally speaking I close the office and I'm the last one here. I took it home when nobody else was here without saying a word. 

A lot of my peers are FURIOUS I ""stole"" my own microwave. Even the company owner and my manager are upset saying I snuck it out at the end of the day or that if I bought it for the office it should stay here. That was never my intention. I never communicated it , but I always meant to take my microwave home with me. It's not like sixty bucks is a lot of money but it's not an inconsequential amount. I dont see why they can't all chip in a bit and buy one that way. Five bucks each or something. I said that and again more angry reactions. 

The screwy thing is my wife is even on their side. Saying most people see it as company property and it's been there so long we should let it go and WE should buy another one. I'm not willing to budge here. It feels foolish that I should donate my personal property because people expect me to. 

AITA?

Edit: Thanks for the input on this one. I guess I was honestly an asshole here. I didn't intentionally bring it home in a way to actively make my coworkers uncomfortable but I think I was also stuck on the ""mine"" like a toddler. This is a bad situation for everyone. I'll take some time and reflect on bringing it back.

Edit 2 : Just to clarify my office has a lot of turnover. It was abundantly clear with that initial group of staff that if was my property. BUT since then it's a lot of new faces. Not justifying anything. Just providing more context to my actions.

Edit 3:
Obligatory ""this blew up way more than I expected!""

 A lot of people seem to be asking ""why doesn't your boss provide one"". I work in an insurance agency. We spend little time in office as possible. Especially the agents and financial advisors. The owner believes more creature comforts = more reason to stay in the office. She says that's how it was when she came into the business. Not a position I exactly agree with. it's nonsense to think a microwave will have a sharp decline in sales. At some level she is entitle to this opinion because she owns the business and she is the largest agent in the area by a very wide margin. Not justifying it. Just sharing. 

Right now I've asked around the office and sort of calmed the waters with most everyone sans 2 or 3 people. Most people took the apology in stride. A few are angry for the sake of it. Planning on confronting the owner at some point tonight. A few people are willing to split the cost but that's if she isn't willing to cave on the issue. Just wanted to add this.

Final update : Met with my boss. It was a very mixed bag. I read a lot of comments on and off today. I decided to throw some weight around. Telling her how much I've earned her what I've done. I basically laid it to the basics that it wasn't fair what she was doing. I told her she created this situation. I told her most people who produce at my level leave in 5 months for other companies. I asked her why I shouldn't go to the place everyone else leaves to. 

She didn't like that. She told me this is EXACTLY why she doesn't like appliances in the office. If it wasn't for clients she'd ditch the coffee machines and fridge too. We sort of went back and forth with this for a while. My boss asked me how would I like it if she went to my home and demanded I bring something in. She disclosed her annual salary. It's very similar to what I make. I called that bluff and asked about business profits. Told her she wouldn't run a company like that if she only made some 11k more than me. 

Negotiations broke down. At some point during this her assistant who's been with the company since day 1 went down the road and bought a microwave and toaster oven from a consignment shop a few blocks over using the imprest fund. She ended the conversation telling my boss ""quit your damn bickering and do some work so we can go home."" 

I feel bad about dragging my bosses assistant into it. That woman is a SAINT. But I suppose this is the desired outcome of it all.

Edit whatever electric boogaloo: turns out at least one of my colleagues found this since it hit the front page. So that's... fun? But seriously y'all, posting ""quit immediately and now"". That's a bit drastic. I have a lot of gripes. But I plan on sticking with my job for a few years for experience. That's a funny thing you see on reddit a lot people say ""quit right the fuck now"". But like, people have houses/bills/etc. I have a daughter. This is the real world. You have to dance to that fiddle sometimes.",False,1572488925.0,2019-10-30 14:24:42
"AITA for not giving my daughter $15,000 from her college?",11055,Not the A-hole,1044,gazw45,1588295789.0,"My daughter’s college completely refunded this quarter’s pay. She came back home because they couldn’t keep dorms up. I got a cashier’s check of $14,937 from the college. I was honestly surprised that they refunded it. 
 
When I told my family, my daughter complained and said that it was her money. I completely disagreed. I paid for her college, she just worked to save up money and for rent. This 15k was entirely for the family, not just for her. 
 
She argued that paying for college was a gift, and this was akin to refunding a gift. I again completely disagree. The money was entitled to me, not her. Therefore it’s my money. While I’m not going to use the money solely for myself, I’m going to put it into a savings account for my other kid.
 
So, AITA?
 
Edit:
 

From what I read, she’s probably not going to college next semester. She has all her credits, and she technically already graduated. She just needs her diploma.",False,1588267799.0,2020-04-30 18:16:29
