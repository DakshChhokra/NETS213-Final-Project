"AITA for taking (28M+28M) our ""big scary dogs"" to the groomer and complaining to the owner afterwards, resulting in the newest hire getting fired?","Me: 28M
Fiance/Husband to be: 28M

Dogs in question:

- Nougat, 7 year old brownish Newfoundlander (75kg/165Ib)
- Olli, 5 year old Basset Hound (32kg/71Ib)
- Pongo, 7 month old Saint Bernhard, longhaired variant (50kg/110Ib)

We've frequented this doggy barbershop every 3 months for 10 years, because it 1) helped with the hair in the home, 2) socialized the dogs and 3) my dogs tend to get pretty smelly around the 3 month mark. 4) we're too ""lazy"" to do it ourselves, so might as well get one of the locals some more business!

Anyway - our dogs are very well behaved, don't bark, don't jump on people (stb hubby is a certified dog trainer) and we can have them off-leash when we're on our 2 daily walks, well except for Pongo seeing as he's still a puppy.

Well.. during lockdown and all other stuff that has happened, one of the groomers in the salon sadly died. They hired a new one recently.. we had a booked appointment and when she saw the dogs, she told us to GTFO because

- 1. The dogs don't need grooming in form of a shower, because they are not ""show dogs"".
- 2. They are ""too big"" (I get it, Nougat and Pongo can seem intimidating, but I swear on Thors hammer, that the most dangerous things they can do, are nuclear farts and drool... much drool). She outright told us, that the dogs were a ""hazard""... while they were sleeping like the fatbois they are.
- 3. We take up time from people with dogs that actually need the grooming.

Now, she wanted us to pay the full amount for ""wasting her time"", which we did - and then we complained to the owner afterwards - the owner who's previously groomed our newfie and our old 120kg/265Ib english mastiff (RIP Pongo I). While we told the owner that we didn't necessarily want her fired, we'd actually want her to just talk to the new employee, because ... business is business, right?

Turns out that she got fired, since this wasn't the first time.. since then, the employee has contacted me on FB and told me that I'm an asshole for ""getting her fired"", which in turn some of my friends agreed with and told us to had just taken our business elsewhere. Which, under normal circumstances I would've done, but we've been with this saloon for 10 years without problems.

AITA for getting mad about my mom marrying my fiance's dad?,"Throwaway. Please don't repost this somewhere else (my mom doesn't have Reddit but does have Instagram, etc. and I don't want her to find this as I do give out some identifiable details. Thank you!)

I (24F) and my fiance (24M) have been together since our sophomore year of college, so around 5 years now.

For context, my mom (50F) had an affair with a coworker when I was 16, leading to my parents' divorce. She has been single ever since (going on dates but no serious relationships). I have a good relationship with my dad and his new wife. Sadly, my fiance's mom passed 2 years ago due to cancer and his dad (53M) has been single since.

My fiance proposed last year but our wedding was delayed due to COVID. Our families had never met up to this point because his family lives in South Carolina, whereas we're in North Carolina (where we went to college), around a 3 hour's drive away from his dad. 3 months ago, in January 2021, we decided that it was time to have our families meet for the first time to discuss our upcoming wedding in June 2021 (held in our backyard, COVID appropriate, immediate family only). My dad and his wife, my fiance's dad, and my mom all met at our place to meet and discuss the wedding. This went well, albeit there was some tension between my mom and my dad.

This morning, out of the blue, my mom called me and announced that she had eloped. I was shocked as she had not been dating anyone to my knowledge. Upon questioning, it turns out that she and my fiance's dad had been dating in secret since that meeting in January and had married in secret yesterday, making my fiance my ""stepbrother"" (I want to throw up just thinking about this). She said that I should now cancel my wedding because it would be inappropriate to marry my ""stepbrother.""

I'm absolutely horrified. I shouted at my mom, saying she ""just loves ruining my life"" and called her selfish - first she cheated on my dad, and now she went and married my fiance's dad, knowing full well I was about to marry my fiance.

My mom then said I was still young and I'd have the chance to meet someone new, but she's old and ""has to take every opportunity she's got,"" and so I was an ungrateful b*tch for not approving of her ""marriage"". She then accused me of wanting her to die alone.

I don't think I'm the asshole, but I just wanted to make sure because ultimately I don't want her to have to be alone even though I think she did that to herself by hurting my dad. I think I should be allowed to marry my fiance as we met first. I'm also 12 weeks pregnant with my fiance's kid so that complicates matters more (we haven't told anybody yet).

AITA for being mad about my mom marrying my fiance's dad and because she said I can't marry my fiance anymore?

Edit: I don't know much about whether it's legal to marry your ""stepbrother"" so if someone could confirm that would be great.

EDIT 2: Mini update, we just called his dad. Apparently, he sees no issue with my fiance and I staying together, it was my mom who had an issue. Honestly, I still don't know how to feel about this because this still feels kinda gross to me. Will probably be going low or no contact.",How long have the OP and her fiance been together?,5 years,10 years,3 months
