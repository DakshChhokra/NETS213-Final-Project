            <h3>Given Passage</h3>
            <p>So my (33F) daughter is 16 and my sister is 23.

My sister is obsessed with her instagram, like she posts 3-4 times a day, she's got an appearance‚ and standards. 

My daughter has struggled with her weight for a while, she's 1.8metres tall (?) And 13stone, our goal is to get her down to 11stone.

My sister took a picture of her and my daughter and posted it on Instagram, my daughter was really excited but when she checked it she got really upset - she hasn't left her room yet.

My sister had heavily edited the picture so my daughter looked skinny.

I was extremely angry and phoned my sister to tell her to take it down/ post the unedited photo, she refused telling me that she just wanted to show the world what a beautiful girl my daughter was and that she promotes health.

My daughter is trying to lose weight, it isn't her fault *and* she's a beautiful, growing girl! My sister has crushed her.

So I commented ‚I'm ashamed, my daughter is beautiful without the heavy editing going on in this photo, be ashamed *sister* for body shaming a teenager, take this down immediately and apologise.

My sister didn't see it in time and got a bunch of negative comments, she took it down but phoned me in tears saying I hurt her and that she's sorry but she didn't mean it etc.

My husband thinks that I went overkill.

AITA?</p>

            <h3>Given Passage</h3>
            <p>So my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she's heard good things about. 
            We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I'm hungry. 

I look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I've never heard of. 
I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). 
Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. 
Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

So anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it's like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. 
I joke to the waiter "where's the rest of my steak?"and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. 
I don't care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it's absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it's highway robbery. 
When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

When the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. 
My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that's where we're different, I don't let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

A manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don't end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. 
My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. 
Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald's and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. 
It's now the next day and I'm starting to think I didn't handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount). 
My girlfriend hasn't responded to my texts so now I'm starting to think I'm an asshole.

Am I the asshole?</p>

            <h3>Comprehension Questions w/ Answers</h3>
            <p><b>Question:</b> Is the author an asshole?</p>
            <p><b>Answer:</b> Yes, because he refuses to pay for the meal</p>
            <p><b>Reason:</b> This is a bad question because it's opinion based and not off the facts in the passage </p>
            
            <p><b>Question:</b> What is the girlfriend's profession?</p>
            <p><b>Answer:</b> Sales Representative</p>
            <p><b>Reason:</b> This is a bad question because we have no information about the girlfriend's profession </p>
            
            <p><b>Question:</b> What does the manager do?</p>
            <p><b>Answer:</b> Yells at the author</p>
            <p><b>Reason:</b> This is a bad because the answer is incorrect </p>
