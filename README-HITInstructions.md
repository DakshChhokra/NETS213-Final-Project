### HIT1: Create Comprehension Questions
Please go here: https://workersandbox.mturk.com/projects/3X3BKUX7FNCTWNLFVDP16HZK4KXUUG/tasks?ref=w_pl_prvw

1. Please use the modal box to open instructions. Your task is to create a **simple** comprehension question that is designed to check if a person has actually read the post. This is seen by clicking on the View instructions page. 
2. Please read the examples provided in the HIT. In particular, good questions exemplify the following: 
    - Unambigious: You should be able to cite a sentence in the passage)
    - Random Location: The question should not be from the direct top or bottom of the post
    - Not pertaining to Intention: All posts are intended for people to evaluate if they are an asshole. You should create questions solely on the situation itself. 
    - Clear: Please have good prose and make things clear as possible. 
3. Questions are in the form of _multiple choice_. You will first type the Question on the first input, then enter the **correct** answer followed by two incorrect answers. 

WARNING: These questions will be used in a study. If we find your question is faulty, your HIT will be rejected. Please provide high quality questions. 

### HIT2: Give Your Judgement
Please go here: https://workersandbox.mturk.com/projects/3X3BKUX7FNCTWNLFVDP16HZK4KXUUG/tasks?ref=w_pl_prvw

1. Begin by reading the passage. You will read a situation from a person who is asking for judgement on whether they are an asshole. 
2. After the passage, there is a definition of what an asshole is. Please anchor your judgement to the definition. 
3. To ensure you are properly reading the passage, you will need to complete three validation questions. 
    - For each question, you will have 3 choices (A,B,C). You can either (1) pick from A,B,C or (2) pick 
  "Invalid question or no option choice correct". 
      - If you pick the latter, fill in the text box below it explaining why you thought the question was invalid or no option choice was correct. We will use your response to help calibrate our questions in the future. You must answer this question if you pick Invalid for your HIT to be accepted. 
4. Finally, provide your judgement. Do you think the author is an asshole? There are four options: 
    -  The Author is the Asshole: Fairly self-explanatory, right?
    -  The Author is not the Asshole, but somebody else is: Usually this is the person that is accusing the poster of being an asshole, but it could indeed be anyone in the situation. 
    - Everyone in the story is an asshole: This is when you are in a situation that is questionable, and everyone is being an asshole. 
    - Nobody is the asshole: This is when a situation is often melodramatic, and indeed, no one is at fault here. 
5. Click Submit.
6. You will then be able to preview your next HIT/post. 
7. After previewing it, you will have the option to skip the HIT (if you don't like it) or accept the HIT.
8. If you accept, you can complete the HIT with the same instructins above. 
    If you skip, you will be able to preview the HIT.
9. Complete as many HITs as you wish.
